Disgusting Hotel !! I do not recommend! DIRTY DUST EVERYWHERE| OLD FURTHERING| PARKING FEE PER DAY . This is unbelievable PRICE IS RIDICULOUS AS WELL $200 for 1 NIGHT ! Disgusting,Aug 17| 2021,1
Hotel was in very bad condition.  Old decor to include old wood paneling with glitter and popcorn ceilings.  The bathtub was painted yellow (years ago I’m sure) and the paint was chipping.  It also over flowed when we showered.  The bed was a little comfy even with the 1980’s leather headboard but other than that it was not a good stay.,Aug 16| 2021,2
Stay for a night,Aug 15| 2021,5
First of all you have an option to park in the lot or garage but dont expect to find a spot in either. After circling around for over 30 minutes i found a spot on the 3rd floor of the garage only to learn there is no elevator so carrying heavy luggage down stairs and in the rain for $24 is just ridiculous.  The bathrooms were gross and need to be updated in the wost way| you know its bad when you feel dirty after a shower because there is mold everywhere...Lastly the AC didn't work and the front desk was unhelpful as well as unsympathetic.,Aug 9| 2021,1
Staff was extra friendly when i checked in even upgraded my room,Aug 9| 2021,5
We had an amazing stay the staff was very friendly and helpful.,Aug 7| 2021,5
I spent 3 night here Mgmt telling me there is no housekeeping? I speak to house keeping they said yes they do housekeeping. No pool the whole weekend. No refrigerator in room furniture and walls with dents in them all over this is hilton and it looks like Filton?  Prices of foood was expensive and laundromats was a maze to find and in the gym ?,Aug 4| 2021,1
I like everything service room clean room,Aug 3| 2021,5
The property advertised that it had an indoor pool| i specifically booked this hotel so I could entertain my 2 children the evening before an early morning flight.  Upon attempting to enter the pool I discovered it was locked.  I inquired at the front desk and they told me it had been closed for months.  The front desk staff was rude when I expressed my disappointment.,Aug 3| 2021,2
Convenient to airport| shuttle to airport gets very crowded in the a.m. May want to run 2 during oeak hours. Almost wasn't able to board.Room abit unclean but manageable,Aug 3| 2021,4
I loved!,Aug 2| 2021,5
Only one elevator seemed to work. No internet at all. No explanations for anything,Aug 2| 2021,3
Location and convenience of the shuttles,Jul 27| 2021,4
Good stay,Jul 27| 2021,4
Professional| expedient| courteous.,Jul 26| 2021,5
DO NOT STAY HERE !!!!! Warning !!!!! I had a 4 day stay at this place snd I absolutely hated it. I only stayed because I hate moving around place to place. For one I contacted this hotel about pool availability which they confirmed the indoor pool was open. When I got to the place it was closed. They misinformed me with this information. i wouldn't have booked with this hotel if that was the case. 200.00 with no amenities. Secondly whenever I used the bathroom and flushed the toilet| it would make a very loud ringing noise for about 5 minutes. I let the front desk know about this several times and there were no resolutions towards it. Housekeeping came into my room unannounced not even a knock and when I told them they were invading my privacy and to never do that again they told me| "they are the manager" like that made a difference. Lastly| Today I was in my room my daughter and I just got out the shower when a white older man came into my hotel room with a fob saying it was his room. He was very apologetic and very disappointed in the hotel and so was I for putting my safety in Jeopardy that way. You don't know what that could've turned into. When I gave them the information they took it and didn't apologize at all. Instead they denied what happened to me and told me they don't do things like that. I am so disgusted in this hotel and I WANT A REFUND ! You all are very greedy people.,Jul 25| 2021,1
Dining facility menu limited,Jul 25| 2021,5
It was a little hard to locate because of unknown roads.  Parking expensive and always full.,Jul 23| 2021,5
Convenient to the airport and overall very nice facility,Jul 22| 2021,5
Wonderful!!,Jul 22| 2021,5
It’s a good option.,Jul 21| 2021,4
The hotel lives up to Hilton standards and there were no issues upon check-in. A mistaken charge to my CC was easily taken care of by a customer service rep. Shuttle service needs a tune-up. We waited nearly 40 minutes for pick-up and when you call the hotel it's a recording stating "shuttle runs every 20 minutes.",Jul 20| 2021,4
It was nice. Outside the city but not far from New York at all,Jul 19| 2021,4
They had a room for me because the place I booking had no rooms and you bozos did tell me!,Jul 19| 2021,1
Every one was very helpful,Jul 18| 2021,5
Room was very clean and quiet.  Bathroom somewhat dated and very tight space wise.  Food served at restaurant was poor.  Breakfast omelette was terrible.  Parking garage is dark and shabby looking.  Not quite a Hilton experience.,Jul 17| 2021,3
Carpet was dirty full of lint and strings| as if it had nit been vaccuumed Bathroom there weren't any amenities. It wasn't dirty,Jul 16| 2021,4
Great overnight spot,Jul 14| 2021,4
Very convenient,Jul 13| 2021,5
Very few amenities provided. Basically just got a few bars of soap. No toothbrushes| etc,Jul 12| 2021,5
About to by covid-19 standards. Dinner was good transport to the airport was timely. For what I wanted was good,Jul 10| 2021,5
I didn't like that parking was charged separately,Jul 7| 2021,4
Shuttle service was horrible,Jul 6| 2021,3
Easy access to airport,Jul 6| 2021,4
Very relaxing short getaway. Clean comfortable safe environment. Friendly staff. Could not as for more on a basic level. Very comfortable beds.,Jul 4| 2021,5
Very busy place. Not much staff around to ask questions. Clean| quiet| convenient.,Jul 2| 2021,4
Convenient to airport with shuttle| with large clean and quiet room. Bed and linens 5-star.,Jul 2| 2021,5
Bed very comfortable.Staff very professional and pleasant.  No microwave or refrigerator. Parking is $24. and $18,Jul 2| 2021,4
The pool was closed and I was there for a full week.,Jul 2| 2021,3
Very convenient CleanProfessional,Jul 1| 2021,5
The smoke detector was chirping all night.,Jun 30| 2021,3
The staff was friendly and helpful. Seamless check in and checkout.,Jun 30| 2021,5
super clean. the resterant was great. BIG helpings and delicious. very helpful. quick and easy in and out with the shuttle.perfect for the for my two kids too.,Jun 30| 2021,5
Old worn out. One of four elevators work causing crowded elevators with long waits.,Jun 29| 2021,2
Why in the world was parking $24? And this wasn’t per day but every time you used the garage parking? I even asked one of the staff if there was separate fee for hotel guests but I was told there wasn’t. Seriously? $24 per use?? That’s absurdly high,Jun 29| 2021,4
Needs updating and more parking,Jun 27| 2021,4
It was great and relaxing.,Jun 27| 2021,5
Very nice hotel,Jun 26| 2021,5
Convenience/proximity to airport was primary reason for staying here.  Did not use any of the amenities.  Hotel itself was nice and clean and staff were friendly.  Shuttle to airport was not the greatest| but it worked out fine.,Jun 25| 2021,4
reasonable quality,Jun 24| 2021,4
Check in was nice ..fast and made sure i was great,Jun 22| 2021,5
Great Service,Jun 22| 2021,5
awesome stay,Jun 22| 2021,5
I choose this room for its amenities. None where actually available| I was not made aware until AFTER a deposit was taken.,Jun 22| 2021,1
old and very dated facility: the bathroom is dated with only shower curtain; no exhaust fan in the bathroom at all; the a/c control is not functioning in the room; parking is always full to the capacity.,Jun 20| 2021,1
We felt safe at this hotel. It was close to the airport for shuttle and for car rentals. The room was adequate and beds comfortable for sleeping. The accommodations met our needs. The hotel is in need of some sprucing up in some areas. We checked out the bar and drinks were expensive for a cocktail snd draft beer. Hotel has a restaurant and Starbucks coffee is brewed. We chose this due to better reviews than other places nearby.,Jun 20| 2021,4
Everything was great housekeeping was very nice & the bartender at the restaurant downstairs made me feel at home.,Jun 20| 2021,5
My 5 yr old son and I enjoyed our one night stay here while visiting family that live in Kearny. I paid the extra 10$ or so dollars for the view of NYC.  My son loves the buildings and seeing airplanes| but I will say that the room we got is on the side of the hotel.  So| there’s literally barely a city view.  This one shouldn’t be consider,Jun 20| 2021,4
Great service| condition & comfortable,Jun 19| 2021,5
Great service and continued communication!,Jun 19| 2021,5
xx,Jun 18| 2021,4
Excellent office set-up in room| although surfaces were slightly worn; good bed and soft pillows; walk-in accessible shower (I'm not handicapped but it was easier than more common bath tub designs). Space around sink was too small to be functional| however.,Jun 17| 2021,4
Water damage in bathroom ceiling; fluffy| thirsty towels| nice water pressure.,Jun 17| 2021,5
Comfort| but not near anything to walk to|ie shop or restaurant,Jun 16| 2021,5
We needed a place to stay because we missed our flight. So for that it was perfect! If we had planned a stay in this area for vacation I would suggest finding a location that has more around it.,Jun 13| 2021,3
Melissa at the front desk and Raul as a server were great! Very friendly| polite| and acceptable!,Jun 12| 2021,4
Everything!,Jun 11| 2021,5
Everything was good,Jun 11| 2021,5
Parking fees to costly | not so clean . Lack of Valet's services .,Jun 7| 2021,4
ok,Jun 6| 2021,4
I didn't like the noise. People were loud until 3am and in the morning too.,Jun 6| 2021,4
Noise all night.,May 31| 2021,2
Nice hotel| didn't know about paid parking until I got there and I didn't get my deposit back that I was told I would once I checked out.,May 26| 2021,3
Close to the airports,May 22| 2021,4
Proximity to airport|  the shuttle service to and from airport was nice even thiugh there was a lot of crowed. The drivers managed to calm everyone and letting them know there is more buses coming.,May 19| 2021,5
The Property itself was decent.  Nice bar/restaurant area.  The Parking was expensive.  The staff was not helpful and seemed overwhelmed.  WiFi did not work.  The beds were Not comfortable.  The cleaning staff was very good.  limited channels on TV.  Will not stay here again.,May 16| 2021,2
Nothing,May 16| 2021,5
Parking is very convenient to the airport. Nice staff.,May 14| 2021,5
Old but greatly maintained place. Nice and clrean. The rooms are carpeted but no smell.,May 14| 2021,5
The room was very dusty and dirty,May 11| 2021,3
I like the view of the room on my floor the carpet smell like milk I am in my room the sink the water did not run out of my sink fast enough,May 10| 2021,3
This large hotel is conveniently located next to Newark Airport and is perfect for an overnight stay for an early morning flight or for a missed connection. I arrived at 9pm and was surprised that the outside parking garage was full and was directed to a spot on the street which I was still billed $18 for. The rooms have been mostly remodeled with the exception of the shower and bathroom door which looked original...odd that they didn't do it all...my room was on the top floor and behind the elevator but I was not bothered by any noise...with the exception of the alarm clock going off at 4:30am (don't they check these)...in the morning I enjoyed the convenience of the Starbucks in the lobby...overall a good value| clean and great location to the airport...,May 9| 2021,4
No indication when booking that there was no parking for guests. In a bad neighborhood with no real dining around. Despite booking the room all guest must pay $18-30 to park overnight. With that| the lot is full and it takes an hour to find parking. I’d suggest one business.....hotel that accommodates its guests and provides parking. I mean I didn’t walk there. I was there to drop off. Instead they have a second business extorting people with parking fees. Should definitely indicate there is no parking; parking next door for a fee. Then of course inform people what that fee is.,May 7| 2021,2
Bar did not stay open long enough,May 7| 2021,5
Hiltons system is not in sync with expedia. i had to wait for 2hours before my room was confirmed,May 5| 2021,1
The loud group in the next room didn’t quiet down till after 2am. I needed to catch the 5am shuttle to the airport so not well rested to travel. My shower had long black hairs on the walls and being a blonde I was sorely disappointed.,May 5| 2021,2
Overall okay. In-room amenities were sparse. Text message after check-in was friendly. Contactless check out was easy! Only complaint is the parking garage. Overly expensive and the ticket reader at the exit is poorly set up and did not work.,May 1| 2021,4
I didnt like that I had to pay for parking,Apr 29| 2021,4
Convenient to the airport| clean and comfortable!,Apr 26| 2021,5
Room was clean and quiet.  Food was so amazing along with service.   I strongly reccomend.,Apr 24| 2021,5
Room was said to be sanitized and cleaned. It was filthy. Hair and stains on the furniture. Not what I expect from Hilton,Apr 24| 2021,2
Clean| large rooms| close to airport. No issues. Staff was very well trained and knowledgeable,Apr 19| 2021,5
The beds were clean| but the bathroom was pretty gross for a Hilton.,Apr 18| 2021,3
Must have the loud floor because both kids and parents were slamming doors| talking extremely loud in the hallways all hours if the night and their kids were running up and Finn the hallway continuously all night. Never going back,Apr 17| 2021,2
I woke up to a distant view of NYC and loved it. The shop was a tad smaller than I thought and was not a fan of the "community" microwave. The bed is amazing (my loking). Had a burger from the bar| I didn't mind the price but it was big enough to feed 2. I was here for only 1 night (12hr layover to Savannah) but overall very pleased.,Apr 16| 2021,5
Not able to shower broken bathroom pipe,Apr 13| 2021,1
Mala atención muy caro para ni desayuno abundante y caro malo todo fue de muy mala calidad comparado con los mas baratos moteles este fue el pegor,Apr 12| 2021,3
Bathroom was old and felt like dirty. Shower had was not working properly.,Apr 4| 2021,2
Room was not very clean. Sheets were not cleaned.,Apr 3| 2021,2
Seamless checkin and easy reminders helped my trip.,Mar 28| 2021,5
Charges kept coming to my card. I used nothing from them but the beds.,Mar 22| 2021,1
Did not meet Hilton standards. Had a non smoking room but my room smelled like cigarettes. Could have spent less elsewhere and had a much better stay.,Mar 16| 2021,2
I stayed overnight for a flight. The hotel provided good service and value,Mar 6| 2021,4
My towels and wash rags smelled like marijuanna. The bathroom sink had mold around the rim. And the hallaways smelled like smoke everyday and there was garabage on the floor everyday as well.,Mar 5| 2021,2
The only thing I wasn’t happy with in the early morning there were not enough transport to the airport for the 6am flight taking in consideration that they need to take the flight crew first.  There should be at least 3 vans going at that time|,Mar 5| 2021,5
noting crazy just nice spot to get to your flight the next day and sum what cheap i guess it works for were its at,Feb 25| 2021,5
Nice stay no complaints conveniently located next to airport,Feb 23| 2021,5
Pros: Convenient| took extra care to drop of guests in airport in shuttles. Cons: Rooms are pretty basic| comparable to an inn.Amenities are pretty basic too: The coffee machine was dusty and was oozing black sediments when I ran it with water| even after 2-3 runs! Restaurant  is expensive for just take out. And there is no other options nearby.,Feb 22| 2021,3
Great place. I really enjoyed my time there. Very clean and not too loud.,Feb 21| 2021,5
Everything over was great ! Staff was great . The parking lot for leaving your cars for the week could have had spaced plowed a little better as some spots were still filled with snow . Overall great stay | stayed 2/5 and 2/13 .. I actually had same room both times..,Feb 20| 2021,5
Check in was easy ! Room was clean.,Feb 17| 2021,5
Great front desk managerCouldn’t be more helpful J,Feb 17| 2021,4
Place was truly amazing loved every bit of it and the VIEW was beautiful,Feb 15| 2021,5
The room was unclean I woke up with rashes all over,Feb 8| 2021,1
Hotel was nice| room was nice| but you could tell the room wasn’t properly cleaned. I needed to go over everything with bleach wipes again. The bathtub was clogged as well.,Feb 7| 2021,3
The place was good rooms was clean and safety requirements were been followed,Feb 2| 2021,5
clean and nice but it wasn't mentioned on the website that parking and breakfast is extra charge,Jan 18| 2021,5
I’m a Hilton Honors mbr but was not able to add my # to this reservation because “I booked through a 3rd party.”   I have added my # to many other Hilton reservations as well as Hampton Inn reservations without issue but this Hilton would not allow.  The Hampton Inns I stayed at on this road trip were in much better condition and I apologized to my daughter who has not stayed at a Hilton before for the lower than expected quality Hilton is known for.,Jan 16| 2021,3
It was a nice hotel spacious room but I wish the pool was open has a nice fitness center,Jan 14| 2021,4
Is a good hotel but should let people know before hand that they need to pay for parking otherwise it was an excellent spot .,Jan 3| 2021,5
Loved the hotel| was very clean and staff was very friendly. The room was nice and big on inside. Will stay again when I’m in NJ,Nov 28| 2020,5
The staff needs to work on cleanliness| too much dust all over the hotel room| the excuse of C-19 is getting old| looks to me that they haven't vacuum the room in a month| the dust was so bad that I was able to see it on my clothing| very awful experience.,Nov 26| 2020,3
Very good! The guy at front desk was very helpful Rene!,Nov 6| 2020,5
This is a dated property. I felt the need to wipe my room down after finding used chewing gum on the side table. I notifies the front seat and management was understanding to my concern. The microwave is down stairs which was a major inconvenience. No hair dryer in the room. All the staff was really nice and the restaurant downstairs was very good. Also| there is no continental breakfast of any kind.,Oct 19| 2020,3
My stay was good however the staff at the Starbucks needs to be better trained.,Oct 19| 2020,4
They kicked me because they said we was smoking when we weren’t,Oct 13| 2020,1
Clean and neat the ewr airport| staff are courteous and clean,Oct 6| 2020,4
Loved it!! Had a very nice time there with my fiancé,Oct 5| 2020,5
Free breakfast would have been great.  Checkin was smooth.  Simple.  Very courteous and helpful.  Great customer service,Sep 26| 2020,5

I had left my $300. Bose headphones in hotel room | after a day i called hotel and asked and they said | they havent found anything| Feels like this hotel is not trustworthy.,Sep 3| 2020,1
Very poor condition| not refrigerator in the room. Not courtesy water| not free parking| not breakfast| very negative impression with the main desk personnel. In the room everything is old including bed | bed feel uncomfortable. Not service to take you  luggage to the room. Hotel is out condition to be in the market for consideration to stay even one night..,Aug 28| 2020,1
My fiancé and I arrived at the Hilton for a 1 day stay due to a funeral in New York. It was cheaper to  fly into Newark| NJ. The hotel was clean| beds were comfortable| and the staff was professional.  It appeared that the hotel can use more front desk clerks| I only saw one.Overall| I would stay again as it is very close to the airport| has a shuttle and its clean!,Aug 20| 2020,4
My flight arrived in Newark at 10:30PM. It cost me about 1 hour in waiting for the shuttle bus.I only find a piece of bar soap in my room. Usually| most of the hotels will give at least 2 pieces or more to the customers.,Aug 17| 2020,3
The staff was very helpful and friendly. Is very closet to the airport,Aug 3| 2020,5
was pretty much clean| very noisy till 2am people were listening to music and can be heard to other rooms| must be non smoking floor but entire floor smelled from people smoking| otherwise staff was helpull with some stuff,Jul 26| 2020,3
Excellent room great service | will be back soon as ASAP,Jul 21| 2020,5
Wait wasn’t too long. Great location,Jul 20| 2020,4
The hotel is old and disheveled.,Jul 6| 2020,3
Property was dated and in need of a major renovation,Jun 30| 2020,2
Very good,Jun 24| 2020,5
It was a pleasant stay very clean and quiet and nice,Jun 14| 2020,5
I enjoyed my stay it was just over night but it was so comfortable and peaceful and very much sanitized and clean,Jun 13| 2020,5
Was advised there was a pool and poool was not accessible,Jun 3| 2020,1
had to change my room | because I had a handicap styled bathroom and I had two babies so I needed a tub. The other room I changed to was dusty.I had to wipe down my headboard and the desk because they were extremely dusty.I also had low water pressure| that took maintenance over an half hour to fix. Other than that it was ok.,May 20| 2020,3
SO very helpful and accommodating during the pandemic crisis| couldn't have been nicer!,May 15| 2020,5

The room is dusty. I can see dust floating on the air i soon as i hit the bed. Of course we have to disinfect the surfaces and i found out that the bedside lampshade has not been moved| too much dirt around the base of it. Need to clean / dust it!  Bed sheet so white.  looks new. Thank you. Bathroom is clean,Mar 17| 2020,3
Get a good price for this place and it is a gem. Airport shuttle| clean large and quiet rooms| and an efficient staff. We had excellent service from all but one of the staff| she was less than interested in helping but did provide accurate service at the desk. The rest were positive and engaging. Facilities are a bit dated but who cares if they are clean| functional and at a great price. Seriously| a good value at a good price. If flying in at Newark the free shuttle gets you to the Newark Airport Bus that will deliver you to Manhattan (several locations) for $17| $10 if you are a senior. Great deal!,Mar 14| 2020,4
Service is always good| staff is very friendly....but the AC is lacking| the last 2 times I stayed it was really hot. It runs on High cool but won’t let you set it lower than 66. I know it’s not that cold and it just kept running. Probably be switching the next visit.,Mar 12| 2020,3
Very Nice| the staff was helpful| spacious room| easy to get out| clean room| but to park your car at the hotel was expensive| thanks to the securities that helped me get to my room| because I was drunk at the bar|  that was a hell of a heads up| hats off for them.,Mar 11| 2020,4
Staff where very helpful and friendly. Room was comfortable and the cleaning staff for room 417 on my visits where amazing. They could not do enough for me.,Mar 10| 2020,4
Terrible you have to pay for the parking additional and we don’t have breakfast| I am well diagnosed with the reservation here at E Hilton hotel| a hotel with prestige and the service so bad and the people who are in the reception of the worst I definitely do NOT recommend it to anyone,Mar 9| 2020,1
Location is between 2 major highways. Very noisy outside.,Mar 9| 2020,4
Staff was super amazing from the minute we walked in. Rooms were super clean. Everything was great except parking. But overall Very happy with our stay,Mar 8| 2020,5
Room was clean| however there was no place to purchase a drink after we returned from a concert. We assumed there would be a vending machine| however none was found.,Mar 8| 2020,4
I received a handicap room. The closet only had a low rod so I was unable to hang my garments without them touching the floor. The bathroom door was a heavy sliding door and didn't close all the way. There wasn't a bathroom vanity -just the sink with no countertop space to place my toiletries. The mini fridge wasn't working either. The main light in the room wasn't working either-only the little night lights.,Mar 5| 2020,3
Generally| OK property.  However| they still charge for in room use of internet.  And| when I asked about this the front desk rudely said "every hotel makes this charge."  Hahaha.,Mar 5| 2020,1
I loved everything it was a great experience I would go again,Mar 2| 2020,5
City view. It was very nice. It has a Starbucks also,Mar 2| 2020,4
Everything is ok| clean| and well located. Good service with shuttles,Mar 1| 2020,4
Close to the airport | easy to book.Nice place (breakfast could open before),Mar 1| 2020,5
1 night| good stay... got it in a well priced offer and no regrets at all,Feb 29| 2020,4
The staff were very accomadating| and the room service was ok. The room left alot to be desired| the sink did not drain| the toilet was dirty| the hot water in the shower was not working. One very apparent issue was the noise factor as the hotel is on the highway that is all you could hear all night. My suggestion is to renovate| update your rooms if you are to compete with surrounding hotels. it is important as a traveler to feel comfortable in your surroundings and first and foremost cleanliness is huge.,Feb 27| 2020,2
I would have rated higher| however| My boss asked to cancel the hotel| which I did | BUT| they charged me for 1 night of the 2 night stay| even though it was canceled 72 hours before arrival. Then my boss changed his mind and I had to rebook and calling the hotel they could not get that charged day back. Terrible policy and will not likely stay there again. Plenty of other choices out there.,Feb 23| 2020,3
My third time at this hotel. The second and third time I could not find parking in the open lot or in the parking structure. Had to use valet.,Feb 22| 2020,4
Room That was reserved unavailable Check in man was ok not friendly,Feb 22| 2020,4
Very clean and comfortable beds! Front desk service was amazing!,Feb 20| 2020,5
I liked how clean everything was. The staff at the front desk were very nice and helpful.,Feb 18| 2020,5
Decent room. No movies on TV. Nice bar and the food looked good| lots of people eating at the bar. Breakfast quite expensive unless you get the all inclusive deal. We left our car there for the week at a reasonable price.,Feb 18| 2020,4
Great location near the airport.  Maybe it's just NJ (and I'm from the Midwest)| but food and beverage prices were "high" in my humble opinion - $15 for a margarita| $23 for the breakfast buffet...,Feb 17| 2020,4
Muy bueno y volvería ir de nuevo 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊,Feb 17| 2020,5
It is a nice hotel to "pass by"| but nothing to do around. No real other option for eating other than the (good but pricey) in house restaurant/pub.,Feb 16| 2020,4
My flight was delayed so I had a late check in. The gentleman at the front desk was rushing to complete my check in which was bitter sweet because I was tired but I also had questions. The next morning I heard a gushing sound coming from the restroom| got up and the toilet was over flowing. I had to call the front desk twice before I got an answer and even when I did I was put on hold. The plumber came up pretty quick but he wasn’t prepared for what he found so he left and returned 10 minutes later. He fixed it but left soaking wet towels on the bathroom floor and said that housekeeping would be by to pick them up. I dozed back off waiting on them| which was no big deal because i was still tired. I woke about 1030 am| two hours after the incident| called for housekeeping to come get the wet towels and bring fresh towels because the plumber used mine. No one came and after 30 minutes I called back| the front desk lady appeared to have an attitude because she asked me to understand that it may be a while because there was a lot going| as though that’s my fault. I got dressed to go downstairs and get the towels myself because I had to be in NYC in less than an hour and was pissed when I saw two housekeepers on my floor laughing in the hallway. I asked if they were aware that I had a leak in my room and needed fresh towel and both said no. I was furious but let it go. The whole experience almost ruined my morning and made me late.,Feb 14| 2020,3
The staff were very polite and accommodating in a situation where they had a lots of last minute bookings due to transportation and cruise ship delays.,Feb 13| 2020,4
close to the airport| very convenient| good shuttle,Feb 13| 2020,4
Check in took a long time| but i think the problem was Expedias fault,Feb 12| 2020,3
This place is so unsafe| the door doesn't lock| i been robbed at this property|  they have no security cameras in the hallways| and I'm still waiting to get an answer regarding my stolen belongings,Feb 12| 2020,1
The room we stayed in had a good bed and the room was clean,Feb 10| 2020,3
The only things I can said is the parking is a nightmare. Is hard to found parking.,Feb 10| 2020,4
This property is very outdated and the heating system sucks!,Feb 6| 2020,1
Super close location to Liberty EWR.  Friendly staff and clean room.  Room temperature difficult to control.  Heater does not work.,Feb 6| 2020,5
Clean| large and comfortable room.  Quiet. Good restaurant.,Feb 3| 2020,5
Close to airport so much less of a hassle.Restaurant on premises  is a plus .,Feb 1| 2020,5
The staffer at the desk was smug and unhelpful. Would recommend going to the Marriott next time.,Jan 28| 2020,3
Although it is older it is clean| the staff amazing& the food was pretty great,Jan 27| 2020,5
Poor customer service. There was a mistake in the reservation and the staff was not helpful to try to solve it.,Jan 26| 2020,2
Loved everything at the hotel bartenders were great great service at check-in ride from airport to hotel and hotel back to airport was right on time thank you Hilton for making our stay so pleasurable,Jan 22| 2020,5
Hotel was great for staying close to the airport. Everything was good.,Jan 21| 2020,5
This hotel is close to airport and complementary shuttle.,Jan 17| 2020,4
The desk office chair in the room was broken. We arrived too late and tired to spend time getting it taken care of. An unnecessary inconvenience.,Jan 16| 2020,3
Clean| modern and comfy bed. I highly recommend for Newark Airport stay.,Jan 9| 2020,4
For a hotel to stay in when you have just got off the plane after travelling for 40 hours this did the job and did it well.  The complimentary shuttle from the Newark Airtrain station and written advice on how to get to Manhattan from the hotel were both a God-send.  It is perfectly clean and comfortable.  We could get room service pizza and a glass of wine when we arrived and a perfectly OK buffet breakfast the next morning before we moved on to Manhattan.  The service was very good.  Other than convenience there is nothing outstanding about this place but on convenience it was excellent.,Jan 8| 2020,4
The staff was great and the location was perfect. The shuttle came and left on time.,Jan 8| 2020,5
Very nice and adequate. Will be back soon,Jan 7| 2020,5
It’s not bad for a night layover near Newark airport.,Jan 7| 2020,4
Clean| comfortable| efficient staff| 25 hour airport shuttle.,Jan 6| 2020,5
Great hotel for an overnight close to Newark Airport. Nice facility| rooms are a good size| fitness room and pool.,Jan 4| 2020,4
Do not like paying for parking. Easy access to airport. Nice property| exceptionally clean. Especially appreciate front desk staff who were very friendly and more than efficient.,Dec 29| 2019,5
The hotel was very nice.  I found the employees lacking in friendliness.We arrived early morning and our room was ready which was very nice.The check in person was not very friendly and other employees when we asked questions were not very friendly but I would stay there again.  The beds were very comfortable.,Dec 28| 2019,4
It is close the airport but the interior is very worn and tired.  it definitely needs TLC,Dec 27| 2019,3
Closeness to the airport...NO restaurant on Mondays have to eat in bar area.,Dec 24| 2019,3
Missed flight due to weather - stayed at airport.  Free airport shuttle. Great location - and restaurant (very convenient).,Dec 20| 2019,4
The “courtesy” Van was anything but courtesy. It also needs to be cleaned.It took 3 try’s to get into a room with a key that worked. Really nasty front desk man!!,Dec 17| 2019,1
Park and fly near Newark Airport.  Good rates.,Dec 16| 2019,4
The front desk and bellman staff were very helpful.,Dec 15| 2019,5
Me and partner had a wonderful stay| clean room| wonderful customer service and it couldn’t have been any easier :),Dec 15| 2019,5
Loved the proximity to the airport. Staff were delightful. Room was comfortable and quiet. Appreciated the shuttle to the airport at 4 am!,Dec 12| 2019,5
The only property in the area that charges excruciating parking rates for guests.  All other hotels in the area do not charge for parking except the Hilton. Terrible location. No quality restaurants in the area. No  microwave oven and the refrigerator was actually a freezer because everything we put in it froze. This property should not be wearing the Hilton name.,Dec 9| 2019,1
Very much an average stay. Nothing special.,Dec 9| 2019,3
Only the shuttle experience was unpleasant... for one| not enough seats on the shuttle bus on the way TO the hotel (after a very long wait to begin with)| and not enough seats on the shuttle bus on the way back to the airport the next morning. Also| a completely chaotic shuttle boarding system even at the hotel in the morning (where it could easily be properly organized)... if you carry luggage| you are less likely to make it on the bus because those with small items can enter the bus even if you arrived at the stop first and lined up to put your luggage in the back of the shuttle.,Dec 7| 2019,4
Easy and quick from airport. great shuttle service. No business center. Not close to office supply store to get printing done.  Not close to outside restaurants.,Dec 6| 2019,4
Didn’t like the fact that there was a parking fee!,Dec 5| 2019,4
Room did not include any beverages| not even water. Really comfortable bed and spacious room.,Dec 4| 2019,4
Staff was very helpful,Dec 4| 2019,5
I had an extremely bad experience with a server at the restaurant.,Dec 3| 2019,1
My husband and I stayed here for a quick overnight stay after getting in from a late afternoon flight. This hotel was terrible - our room was not clean| there was hair all over the place and some of the furniture was stained. Our air-conditioner was broken and while engineering fixed it for a few hours| it broke again in the middle of the night so our room was about 80 degrees. The service was alright but nothing stellar. Overall this was a very unpleasant experience and one that was really regrettable after what had been a lovely vacation. I would not recommend staying here.,Dec 2| 2019,1
The thermostat didn’t function. Never could get the temp below 78.,Dec 2| 2019,3
Shower had hair all over in it and the rims of the toilet so the maids need to clean better other than that everything was fine!,Dec 1| 2019,4
Stay was good trying to contact your desk from outside facility to inquire about shuttle was brutal.,Dec 1| 2019,5

Great location in proximity to airport. Would stay there again.,Nov 20| 2019,5
Limited access to surrounding area. Would have loved an area to smoke. Not in the front of the hotel,Nov 19| 2019,4
Stayed 2 nights...not much to do or see in the area but close to EWR.  It is a simple place to stay on a short basis... Free airport shuttle 24hrs...restaurant onsite but did not try it...Starbucks onsite as well! Very easy check-in and check-out...asked for an extra 1hr| no problem staff was accommodating. It is not a brand new place but gets the job done!,Nov 18| 2019,4
Took forever for them to answer the phone| and when they finally did they sounded irritated and hung up. We arrived at the hotel and saw four front desk personnel and not a single customer.  Wonder what kept them from answering the phone.  Facility was outdated.  There was a sign for free shuttle to the mall but when we asked the front desk they said they only do shuttle to and from the airport.,Nov 18| 2019,1
I never made it to the hotel as I missed my connecting flight and I was unable to get a refund or credit on the room so I am totally disappointed and wasted a significant amount of money.,Nov 10| 2019,2
The staff has been very pleasant...but the property is extremely old and underwhelming for the cost of everything !,Nov 9| 2019,3
Hotel showing signs of age. Service in restaurant slow and haphazard,Nov 7| 2019,4
Everything was great. Friendly staff,Nov 7| 2019,5
Worn out used hotelToilet running all night,Nov 6| 2019,3
Stayed one night prior to an early morning connecting flight. A bit loud; amenities adequate but nothing special.,Nov 4| 2019,4
The location of the hotel was okay. But there was only paid parking on site. Plenty of other hotels in the area had free parking for guests| so a 10 dollar minimum and up to 30 dollars a day isnt worth it if you have a rental car. Inside the room| the bathroom door wouldn't close properly and most if the furniture was quite worn down.,Nov 2| 2019,1
The hotel looks old and run down.  The bar is good and so is the bar service staff.,Oct 30| 2019,3
After a delightful 3-night stay at the Hilton Garden Inn in Troy| NY| my wife and I had a very disappointing| unplanned one-righter at this hotel due to weather related issues with our flight back home that evening.Room #521| a handicap outfitted room had the following issues:1.Bathroom floor grout noticeably dirty/moldy. 2. The flexible shower hose faucet did not stay in place; it sent water in all directions. The fixed faucet was not operational.3.The toilet seat was loose| and missing a bolt cover.4.The bathroom  floor was soiled. We had to lay towels on the floor to walk on it| Yuk!I have photos!Other non-critical but disappointing issues: uncomfortable mattress and pillows. Formica laminated furniture. Internet is not free. We are Hilton Honors members| but since we booked through Expedia| we were not eligible for free Wi-Fi.Finally| the shuttle vehicle that takes you from and to the airport was horrendous. We felt as if we were in a third| close to fourth world country city. The only good thing about the shuttle bus was the paint job. The suspension shocks are shut; the vehicle bounces back and forth and up and down| the wheel chair lift rattles as if the shuttle was reentering the atmosphere from outer space| The seats were hard and covered with a slippery cheap fabric| so we had to hang on to each other to avoid being spilled out. It was almost comical!,Oct 29| 2019,2
The staff was lovely but only one of the four elevators works and it was filthy inside| so much so that though my room looked clean I wiped down every surface I was going to be using. I would not stay here again. Frankly| I've stayed at Hilton properties before and I was surprised that the place had been allowed to become shabby. In addition there was a strong chemical smell in the room toward morning that I was relieved to leave as I caught my early morning flight.,Oct 29| 2019,2
Was disappointed with the check in process. Disappointed in room as it was much shabbier than we would have expected for a Hilton property. Old. Run down| dirty feeling. Beds were awful.,Oct 29| 2019,2
Not enough parking.  On-site car rental has limited hours.Shuttle to and from Newark Airport was convenient.Rooms were clean.,Oct 28| 2019,4
Lovely hotel| great food at the restaurant. The staff were wonderfully helpful and cheerful! We are coming back in April and will definitely stay here again.,Oct 28| 2019,5
Cleanliness and service. The room was pretty big| the bathroom spacious. People behind the desk were friendly. They have a very efficient airport pickup system every twenty minutes.  I would  definitely recommend Airport Hilton and stay there in future,Oct 28| 2019,5
We stayed the night before a flight.  Shuttle service to and from the airport was as advertised (timing).  Reception was polite and professional—even gave us a late checkout (sore subject as I called in a couple weeks in advance to arrange a late checkout and it was not noted in the reservation).  One of my pet peeves are hotels that use a flat sheet on the bottom (if you roll around like I do it inevitably comes untucked).  Yes| they use the flat sheets on the bottom.  The corridors are a wee bit beaten up.  But the hotel was clean.  Oh| and the in room coffee was actually rather good.  So the ultimate question-would I stay there again?  Probably.  If I get a good deal| yes.  If not no...,Oct 26| 2019,4
Booked a King Bedroom and once I arrived I was told that the King Rooms were sold out and given away on a first come first serve basis. I was upset as I had reserved and pre-paid for a King Bedroom and instead was given two double beds. I know it seems petty to some| but since I had specifically requested this room and then was told they were “first come first serve” I was unhappy. I don’t think hotels should oversell their room types so people don’t get what they reserved. To top it off| the front desk associate kept talking up the double room like it was their top tier room and it was just very fake.,Oct 24| 2019,2
Our stay at The Hilton Newark Airport was outstanding for my wife and I 15 year anniversary! Percy| who drives one of the vans there| is awesome and customer friendly!,Oct 23| 2019,5
the lobby is nice with a Bar and restaurant until midnight. They have Starbucks too. The room was ok. The toilet clogged twice but they came to fix it quickly.,Oct 21| 2019,4
Great location near airport. Shuttle bus runs frequently.,Oct 21| 2019,5
Good location overlooking the airport. Comfortable and quiet room with all important complementary bottled water and Wifi.  Slight issue connecting to the Wifi but this was taken care of by reception. Regular shuttle to the airport and Jersey Mills Mall. I eat several meals at the hotel and was pleasantly surprised how nice the food actually was! Good gym and pool also. A better hotel than expected.,Oct 21| 2019,4
Room was not very clean| outdated| the sheets are not soft| rough cotton| the shower area is quite old. The restaurant is for survival mode.,Oct 19| 2019,3
The staff and accommodations were excellent| they follow up consistently for an excellent stay! Even when the floor has some louder than normal guests| all was taken care of! Thank you!,Oct 16| 2019,5
Nice place and nice staff| everything was fine and the rooms were clean and quite,Oct 16| 2019,5
Average room| clean| nothing fancy. Starbucks on premises is nice. No vending machines but a pricey self serve pantry store available in lobby. 24 hour Shuttle service every 20 minutes which we took to the train station a couple of times which was convenient. Staff was all pretty nice| a couple nicer than others. There’s not much around without a car and the hotel food is pretty pricey so we had pizza delivered.,Oct 15| 2019,4
Jamillah| who worked the front desk| was incredibly kind and helpful! She went above and beyond to make sure we had a good trip. Hotel was clean and well maintained. The shuttle staff was friendly too. We used the shuttle a lot. No complaints here!!!,Oct 14| 2019,5
Near a freeway but thick windows so silent.  Food overpriced.  Ordered a piza and glass of milk and cost $35 and not even very good.  No nearby stores or restaurants so you are stuck with hotel food.  The food items in little gift shop pantry not good either.  All junk food. Beds were good.  You can save $50 t0 $80 by staying at one of the other chains nearby but risk more noise and less comfortable bed so I paid up.  Airport shuttle from air train stop P4 does not come on a fixed schedule and only every 25 minutes or so so if you miss it can be kind of frustrating to wait in the cold. Shuttle to airport filled up so I had to wait for the next one so be careful about this.  They don't do reservations. Allow time or be front in line. But all in all I got what I wanted.,Oct 12| 2019,4
I liked the accommodations| the bedding and bed were extremely comfortable. The free shuttle service was also very convenient and very speedy! The bathroom on the other hand was very slow to drain and toilet also clogged up.,Oct 12| 2019,4
The airport shuttle from the airport only comes at their convenience| a group of 10 had to wait over 45 minutes to be picked up.  Do not stay at this hotel if you need to rely on the airport shuttle.,Oct 8| 2019,2
Stayed here on route to a family wedding. Buffet breakfast was nice. It wasn't a free breakfast| but wasquite good. Rooms are clean| spacious and quiet.Beds are very comfortable. The shuttle to the airport runs every 20 minutes.,Oct 6| 2019,4
My husband and stayed at the presidential suite. It was beautiful!! Great location| perfect view| and great staff. Thank you!,Sep 30| 2019,5
Nice and clean. Friendly staff. Staff at the Starbucks kiosk should be more knowledgable and friendly.,Sep 30| 2019,4
Excellent people and STARBUCKS onsite| score. Only negative| the shuttle should keep looping  it isn’t that far.,Sep 29| 2019,4
The Cleaness and a Very helpful staff. The hotel shuttle bus clean and the driver well dress.,Sep 22| 2019,5
This property is nothing compared to the Hilton brand ...,Sep 21| 2019,2
I didn't like that there was no refrigerator in the room. Parking should be free for guests (valet $32 or Self parking garage $24),Sep 18| 2019,4
Conveniently close to the airport. Good shuttle to hotel.,Sep 16| 2019,5
It was very neat and clean.The only thing I didn't like is that the business center had two Mac computers| and someone had stolen the mouse from each computer| rendering them useless. So I had to go to the front desk to get on the JetBlue website and print out my boarding pass.,Sep 12| 2019,3
Clean| quiet and provided everything we needed.  The service to the docks was perfect.,Sep 10| 2019,5
None qwqwqqqqqqwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwOoooooooooooo,Sep 9| 2019,3
The property was very close to the airport. It was very nice and the room was quite comfortable. There was a restaurant| bar and Starbucks in the Lobby!,Sep 9| 2019,4
Very worn facility. Dirty. No love given to this hotel and facilities. Take the Hilton sign down!,Sep 4| 2019,3
Clean rooms. The hotel was very nice looking although I had no time to take a tour. The bus took long load us at airport... maybe because it was a holiday and was really crowded.Starbucks was only open until about 11:30 or 12 pm. Would of been nice longer hours but everything was good.,Sep 3| 2019,4
I didn't not appreciate the check in person who simply took a man who bullied his way straight to the desk ignoring people in line| but put us two women into the wait line which was not moving because he was being avoided| no one wanted to deal with him. So I waited my turn and told him| I didn't appreciate being discriminated against as women| him having checked in the bully without comment first. the rest was human neutrality on both our parts of the conversation. He appears to be a sadist and I would prefer a polite friendly person rather than a passive aggressive one. Thank you,Sep 3| 2019,5
Not friendly staff| no free breakfast| parking fee,Sep 3| 2019,3
Our flight was 12 hours late but they kept our reservations and were very polite at checkin at 4am. Service was exceptional.,Aug 31| 2019,5
Floorbtiles broken on bathroom. Not clean well| hair on the floor,Aug 30| 2019,2
Very friendly front desk. Restaurant staff and food was excellent,Aug 27| 2019,5
Was pretty enjoyable,Aug 25| 2019,4
I want my money back... this hotel is horrible. Disgusting. So dirty. And extra $18 for parking each night,Aug 24| 2019,1
Flight delays forced the overnight stay but the Hilton hotel came through with a clean and comfortable room. Small restaurant but good service from pleasant staff.,Aug 20| 2019,4
The property is in the middle of nowhere. Hotel bus should go to some other places.,Aug 20| 2019,2
Everything was clean and nice.. Staff was also nice,Aug 19| 2019,4
Very old and in need of major renovation. Elevator made squeaky sounds.,Aug 19| 2019,3
Room is very clear|nice service.checkin and check out fast. Thanks,Aug 16| 2019,5
Mostly good. Could have been cleaner as there were some small stains on the bed sheets etc. The room itself needed new decorations and appeared somewhat dated.,Aug 16| 2019,4
Facility needs upgrades| but room wasn't bad. Food and drink we're crazy expensive.,Aug 13| 2019,4
As I entered into the hotel| I was amazed at the design of the hotel! It was so classy and beautiful. However| upon entering into my room| I was disappointed by the two small double beds. I have stayed at many hotels|  so I have seen a normal size full| or queen double bed| that can accommodate two people. Lastly| when it was time for me to check out| the receptionist informed me that I had to pay $18.00 for parking! Oouch! Talk about being flabbergasted. The receptionist stated that the sign is located in front of the parking lot| but once again| I have stayed at many hotels| so parking is free if you stay overnight. But other than that| I enjoyed myself.,Aug 12| 2019,4
Close to airport without the noise of the planes flying overhead.,Aug 12| 2019,4
Just stayed here for 1 night before a morning flight out of EWR the next morning. Front dest staff was very warm| welcoming| helpful and professional. Valet and restaurant staff were also very nice and courteous. Rooms are a bit dated and older| but very clean and comfortable. All in all a nice stay and I would definitely stay again if I need to be close to Newark airport.,Aug 11| 2019,5
Clean rooms| excellent service while waiting out a canceled flight. Definitely would book again!,Aug 9| 2019,5
Nice rooms.  Restaurant was not good.  Check in staff was not helpful or patient- just wanted you to move on,Aug 6| 2019,3
Communication with Expedia was very poor - no response to email enquiry,Aug 5| 2019,5
I liked the lobby| as it seemed clean and inviting. Also the room service was fast and delicious. What I didnt like about Hilton was the bus service from airport to hotel. The service took way too long for pickup and there was about 50 ppl waiting for 1 bus. This was at 8pm| not crazy late hours. Bus staff service was also very short and didnt really help with your bags.,Aug 5| 2019,3
Easy access to airport| very friendly staff 2nd time here and no complaints,Aug 2| 2019,5
Nice location near airport. They have a free shuttle| but we had to ride 2 different air trains at Airport to get to pick up location. Room was nice but we found leftover food from previous guests in the fridge.,Aug 1| 2019,4
Staff answered any question that I happened to have.Bar had Dogfish Head 60-minute (one of my faves) on-tap = BONUSBreakfast was great (French Toast) furniture in there looking a bit worn..,Jul 31| 2019,5
Was not up to standard i was expecting.Staff were very friendly and Breakfast was extra| expensive and not up to the quality i usually get from a Hilton Hotel.,Jul 29| 2019,2
The staff was not too friendly| not helpful. Blood on the bedding in my room (not stains| dried blood).,Jul 28| 2019,3
Property is tired and not clean in guest areas.  Rooms where fine.  Not good just fine which is what I expected at this price point,Jul 28| 2019,3
The great attitude of the person who checked me in was awesome!,Jul 25| 2019,5
Limited food service| no nearby restaurants. Their shop “pantry” was very minimal.,Jul 23| 2019,4
I would like a microwave in the room. And a bathrobe,Jul 21| 2019,4
This hotel is close by the airport with shuttle service,Jul 14| 2019,5

Overnight stay returning from an international flight to flight on home. Clean room| excellent room service. Staff kind and pleasant,Jul 8| 2019,4
The staff was wonderful and pleasant from the very beginning. Loved there was a pool. Not enough parking.,Jul 7| 2019,4
It was great experience all around. Online downside would’ve been parking| however| everything else was great and as expected.,Jul 7| 2019,5
It was ok! Parking could have been better and less!,Jul 6| 2019,4
One night stay pre-flight. Hotel was of a good Hilton standard. Staff went out of their way to be helpful and attentive.,Jul 5| 2019,4
One of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed at!,Jul 5| 2019,5
It was conveniently located.  I wish you had a discount policy for patrons parking on the lot.  It was very expensive.,Jul 5| 2019,5
Very happy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Nice friendly staff.,Jul 4| 2019,5
24-hour shuttle was great!The desk clerk who checked us in was friendly and helpful! The treat of two bottles of water upon check -in was really nice!,Jul 2| 2019,4
Shuttle to and from airport and shuttle available to cruise port,Jul 1| 2019,5
Parking is way too expensive and you are charged per day for it. Guests should be able to park for free. Rooms are dated| but functional. Room service is good. Wi-Fi is functional most of the time.,Jun 30| 2019,3
I liked the customer sercice| the appearance| the restaurant and fitness center| and found most everything to be comfortable overall. Unfortunately| my room was too cold and even though I repeatedly raised the temperature| the thermostat kept resetting to 66°| amd and I couldn't figure out how to correct this.,Jun 28| 2019,5
Great stay for a layover,Jun 25| 2019,5
The restaurant was useless| uninviting| service staff unfriendly and slow. Furniture in the bar area was outdated and so heavy one could not move a chair for more comfort.,Jun 24| 2019,4
The trip was great everything when as plan.,Jun 24| 2019,5
Very nice property| staff in general is very nice and kind (particularly Bell and Front Desk Staff). Very conveniently located near Newark airport. Shuttle service could be better| but in general the level of service received at the property is fantastic,Jun 21| 2019,5
How and where the restaurant was set up was unique and pleasant.,Jun 21| 2019,5
Room smelled like dirty socks. Many items were dusty.,Jun 21| 2019,3
Nice service| good location near the airport.  Staff very good.  Friendly and accomodating.  But the hotel was under renovation and seemed a little bit chaotic.  The rooms were dated and need renovation.  All in all| everything was fine| but some work needed to be done to get it up to normal Hilton standards.  Would stay there again.,Jun 13| 2019,4
We were surprised at the overall condition of the property and plainness of the rooms.  We were not impressed and didn't feel we were at a Hilton.,Jun 13| 2019,3
Was to pick up someone at airport,Jun 11| 2019,4
The property was noisy and very smelly the beds were extremely uncomfortable worst Hilton I’ve ever visited,Jun 9| 2019,1
My stay was fabulous only thing the hotel needs is more food options,Jun 4| 2019,4
The ticket gates leaving the parking lot took 20 minutes to work. The first time leaving it wouldn’t accept my card. Then upon check out it took my ticket but would not let me pay. It was Avery stressful experience exiting the parking lot.,Jun 2| 2019,5
The front desk staff here are friendly and helpful!,May 28| 2019,5
The front desk staff was very fry & helpful| particularly Mr Shahid,May 28| 2019,5
Great place to stay for easy access to metlife stadium.,May 27| 2019,4
The room and lobby was clean but when we went by the pool it didn’t seem really clean and was disappointed the Starbucks in the hotel was only open until 12:30pm every day and they didn’t have as many coffee options,May 25| 2019,4
I loved how beautiful it was and how nice the rooms were! It was a great experience for my first time alone in a hotel.,May 25| 2019,5
The staff was poorly trained and not up to Hilton Standards.  My A/C went out and the motor was putting out a gas smell.  I called and called their guest line and no one would answer.  I literally had to go down to the front desk in my pajamas to get the problem taken care of.,May 24| 2019,1
Very conveniently located with quick access to Turnpike and Newark Penn Station.,May 22| 2019,4
Close to the airport. Shuttle service was a life saver.,May 21| 2019,5
Larry was the ONLY employee in that place that delivered outstanding customer service from the moment we arrived! We really appreciate Larry so much! We had so many issues with the other staff not wanting us to give us extra water bottles|blankets| and no one being at the restaurants to assist us. Terrible experience overall. Will never book this hotel again. Larry was the only great thing about this place.,May 20| 2019,1
Staff was rude| and airport shuttle was less than pleasant,May 20| 2019,3
The room was clean and the staff was extremely helpful and accommodating.,May 17| 2019,5
Very well looked after,May 15| 2019,4
Everything fast service to check in place was very clean and nice,May 13| 2019,5
Had to repair toilet and elevators very very slow on departure morning. Couldn’t turn off strip lights,May 10| 2019,2
Thanks. Great location if going to the airport. Clean and friendly.,May 7| 2019,5
Free shuttle to the airport... Great customer services.,May 4| 2019,5
The staff was very nice and helpful. The hotel shuttle was very convenient to and from the airport. My only problem was that i didn't have a microwave in the room.,Apr 30| 2019,4
Staff is rude| technically Ghetto.... They treated me with disregard and very unprofessional. Was standing in front of check in and was ignored for 15 min before they asked me how they could help me. In the morning when I went to eat breakfast I was seated and then got up to serve myself breakfast to only find out that my table was given to someone else and had to wait for staff to fix another table for me. Overall worst Hilton Ive ever stayed in. I love Hilton Hotels I always stay in them anywhere I go but I would not recommend this one particular location.,Apr 26| 2019,1
No walking distance for other restaurant. Hotel restaurant pricey not good food but decent. Pro is the free shuttle to airport.,Apr 25| 2019,3
Worst Hilton  experience of my life. Never againShuttle did not run to airport waited 40 minutes,Apr 25| 2019,1
I like everything| me gustó todo estaba excelente y pienso volver muy pronto,Apr 22| 2019,5
Restaurant staff and food| size of the room| the price and the shuttle to airport,Apr 20| 2019,5
Close to airport and free shuttle was a bonus.,Apr 16| 2019,5
I don’t know how you offer me this hotel with that price and the price is not that great for me and AC not working,Apr 16| 2019,1
Just a basic hotel| nothing too fancy. It was ok. I liked the free shuttle to the airport.,Apr 14| 2019,3
Close proximity to the airport with shuttle..Very clean| excellent service...,Apr 9| 2019,4
Hope was clean and staff friendly. Shuttle from airport was slow but adequate.,Apr 7| 2019,4
The view| the room was great,Apr 7| 2019,5
Very clean. Polite staff. Quiet and comfortable room. The airport shuttle was very fast.,Apr 7| 2019,5
Clean| up to date| nice amenities| have to pay for parking which I didn’t like| and room service is a little pricey but over all good hotel.,Apr 6| 2019,5
The property and staff were first rate. When we arrived the hotel had no record of our expedia reservation. It took a while to sort this out but we eventually got a room and our expedia reservation and payment were honored. Staff were very good to us during our wait.,Apr 5| 2019,5
IIt is a old run down hotel .  can see that they are dong omething but I should have known it was going through a constiction phase.,Apr 4| 2019,2
This was my second time staying here| as the previous stay was brilliant.   Service|cleanliness|etc was without a fault.  Both stays were for 1 night as we used it for a stop on our way to a cruise the next day .   My only complaint was the prices in the restaurant.  The food was fantastic| and interaction with the host|waitstaff and chef was excellent.   But felt hostage to the prices in the restaurant as there was no other food options around| being without a vehicle. Nothing Available in walking distance.,Apr 4| 2019,4
Check in was fine but our room was warm.  Turned the temperature down but an hour later is was still very warm.  Called maintenance and they arrived shortly later.  The nice gentlemen tried to fix it but was unable to.  So he arranged to move across the hall to another room which was much cooler.  Overall a good experience and am glad they were able to solve the problem in a very short time.,Mar 26| 2019,4
Cleanliness was an issue.  Small refrigerator in room did not work| carpet dirty with burn marks on floor - not great to walk on.  Add more items in Pantry at REASONABLE prices.,Mar 23| 2019,3
Hotel was clean and very close to the airport. Free shuttle from the airport. Good breakfast buffet with excellent service. Front desk staff was very pleasant. Hotel driver took us to Laguardia the next day and he was terrific.,Mar 19| 2019,5
Close to the airport.  Good value.  Free shuttle to airport.  Clean rooms.  Decent restaurant.  Good for a lay over or a few day stay.,Mar 19| 2019,4
Very nice room| clean| friendly staff. My only complaint is the airport shuttle service. Transportation to the airport on Sunday morning was disorganized. I ended up getting off at the first stop (Terminal A) and finding another way to Terminal C.,Mar 18| 2019,4
the place is a little run down | other than that it was just ok,Mar 16| 2019,3
Staff was extremely friendly and polite. Rooms were clean but not extraordinary. Gym wasn’t great. Very minimal equipment for an actual workout. Pool was amazing.,Mar 12| 2019,5
Shuttle service very reliable; free service.  Every twenty minutes.    Bed very comfortable| two doubles.  Lots of choices on TV..   Only problem was pizza in restaurant-  hard as a rock- do not order pizza.,Mar 5| 2019,5
Good Hotel| close to airport,Mar 4| 2019,5
The hotel is Very convenient for flights out of EWR,Mar 2| 2019,4
This hotel is not worthy of the Hilton label. There appears to be some reconstruction underway| however| the property is so outdated it would take a complete gutting to change it to a name worthy of Hilton. Mattress of inferior quality to todays standards.,Feb 28| 2019,1
Staff was friendly and helpful.  Upgraded me but to a room that obviously had a smoker in it.,Feb 26| 2019,2
It was isolated and construction mad it a bit ugly,Feb 26| 2019,3
Close to airport but a depressing property - poor condition.,Feb 25| 2019,2
We always stay at the Hilton Newark Airport when we travel. Staff are always so friendly. Accommodations are comfortable and always clean.,Feb 24| 2019,5
Room Service was excellent and the Manager| Larry was very helpful. The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable. The wifi was very good too! While there was some construction in the lobby| the property was still in good shape. There are shuttles to the airport and a parking garage steps away from the hotel| You also have the option of Valet parking. You could not be closer to the airport. I would stay again!,Feb 19| 2019,5
I do t liked to much because I need to paid the parking lot,Feb 18| 2019,3
Parking was expensive.  I wish the parking were free if staying at the hotel,Feb 18| 2019,4
Really nice stuff| comfortable bed| airport shuttle,Feb 18| 2019,5
Close to airport yet very clean. Shuttle always awesome!,Feb 15| 2019,5
Old and lousy. No free shuttle to city or somewhere near except airport. Only one restaurant in hotel and limited menu.,Feb 14| 2019,2
Restaurant was really great and the service.The workout room was also really nice,Feb 12| 2019,4
Right from the getgo had bad feeling as we walk in| while booking no visibility by Hotels.com that this place is under renovation.Add a symbol for hotels under reservation ao user can figure out to stay there or explore  alternative option.Paid $300+ plus for suite but had leaky bathroom. No water bottle in the room when called the front desk| was told to come down and take it | when I came down to get it they had no water bottles huh - why can’t you check before tell me and in first place how come you are out of water bottles.Room service food was awful and smelled| paid $85+ as had to keep ordering to see what is fresh.Bar downstairs was the only bright spot.,Feb 9| 2019,1
the room was nice and I slept well. The restaurant food was ok|,Feb 4| 2019,5
The hotel was a last minute decision due to cancelled flight. The room is nice. The restaurant in lobby is great. Great food and service,Jan 30| 2019,5
Close to airport. Shuttle service efficient| running every 20 minutes.,Jan 29| 2019,5
It was convenient for my situation | we came to a birthda party in the area and only needed to stay overnight . Room was clean and the bed was comfortable .Entrance revolving door area was not working | we had to use the side doors and the brass was not the cleanest thing to touch .,Jan 28| 2019,3
My room was clean and the bed was comfortable | was there for a short stay....,Jan 28| 2019,3
Stayed here after our flight was canceled. Great hotel. Clean with updated rooms. Very comfortable and the bar area had great service.,Jan 23| 2019,5
Staff were friendly and efficient| all facilities were clean.,Jan 22| 2019,4
The building is aesthetically pleasing inside and out.  Parking is terrible. I understand why it is pay parking but it is still terrible. There was nowhere that I could find to park if you were just checking in and dropping off your luggage in your room. I was there about an hour before i had to leave and it cost me $10.,Jan 19| 2019,4
Beds we’re super comfortable and the food was good,Jan 18| 2019,4
Late night checkin. Easy and fast. Free waters with my Rewards #. Grand lobby. Not loud. Could not even hear the traffic| and no airplane noise at all. Professional staff.Great TV. Great internet. Great nights sleep.,Jan 16| 2019,5
Rooms were fairly old and dated but still functional overall. Staff were friendly and helpful.Room was not well cleaned as there was still prior occupant’s long hair on the sofa and on the floor,Jan 15| 2019,3
Hotel charges $25.00 for early check-in; as such| we left our bags there are made our way to the city. Upon checking-in at 2:30am (the next day)| we found a used dirty washcloth inside the shower| no soaps or shampoo| just a lotion that was 3/4 used. Most ridiculous is their free airport shuttle. We used it four times total (2 round-trips to the airport) for airport and train use and It was chronically late. It does not run every 20 minutes from the top of the hour as advertise; in fact| we saw one hotel shuttle make two rotations before the Hilton van ever showed up. We had one driver twice and he was so rude and acted as if everyone on the shuttle was an inconvenience that we considered forgetting the shuttle and calling an uber.   With so many other options around the Newark airport| I would choose a different hotel!On a positive note| the bed was comfortable| there is a Starbucks in the hotel and it appears to be well maintained (other than the housekeeping issues).,Jan 14| 2019,2
Dusty rooms. Check out a day earlier because of all the dust and awful smells like humidity in the room.,Jan 13| 2019,1
Very friendly atmosphere Clean and comfortable Good restaurant,Jan 8| 2019,4
Great location| really nice staff| good food although it was a bit overpriced. Very convenient to the airport for sure!,Jan 8| 2019,5
Close the airport and free shuttle| service was excellent.,Jan 7| 2019,5
Overcharged hotel with poor service| surrounded by cemetery. They also charged us $ 54.00 parking fee for our 3 days stay at the hotel. Not recommended especially for family.,Jan 7| 2019,2
I enjoyed my late night check in| staff was terriffic.... their shuttle driver was professional and friendly..  from was wonderfully clean and nicely appointed.,Jan 6| 2019,5
Everything was perfect Room so clean Stuff so friendly,Jan 6| 2019,5
I didn't like anything about the property. No courtesy or compassion from any of the staff.  I had to park my car far away from the hotel next to a graveyard because there was no parking available. The worst experience ever.,Jan 6| 2019,1
Good location| security need some training to threat guests with respect when informing| rooms dirty lots of dust.,Jan 5| 2019,4
Stayed overnight inbetween a connecting flight. Free shuttle was quick and extremely convenient. Beds were comfortable but very small and the restaurant downstairs is very overpriced for what you receive.,Jan 5| 2019,4
Proximity to Newark Airport| only 7 minutes drive away!!! Service staff are very patience with guest requests. Compliments to the hotel shuttle drivers!  The hotel shuttle that I tried to board was overcrowded but my luggages and my family are already on board. The driver made the initiative to call his backup shuttle immediately to pick the remaining guests| saving us from the blizzaring cold.,Jan 4| 2019,5
Basic parking was not they charged me everyday  not a good place I liked,Jan 3| 2019,1
Couldnt stay long flight leaving early morning but over all the stay was relaxing and was able to order a late night dinner.,Jan 3| 2019,5
They have everything to make some but no bottle water,Jan 3| 2019,3
Had a pleasant stay at the Hotel| staff was friendly.,Jan 2| 2019,5
The beds were really uncomfortable| and the sheets were dirty. They were obviously not changed before our stay. Staff was cold. Had to call front desk to have our bed linens changed 3 times| and no one never even apologized for the inconvenience. They really didn't care.,Jan 2| 2019,2
Great bar and staff Angel was professional and courteous,Jan 2| 2019,5
This is a great hotel in a ugly neighborhood. We spent two nights at a reasonable price for the holiday season.,Jan 2| 2019,4
Good hotel| clean| convenient. I do like that I pushed to give review and not able to see the final charge.,Jan 2| 2019,5
Everything was good. The pool was nice. Should stay open later,Jan 1| 2019,5
great room great breakfast shuttle from the airport made it easy to get to the hotel,Dec 31| 2018,4
I like that the property is close to the airport| I did not like the pillows on the bed and| the expensive parking that guest has to pay|,Dec 30| 2018,4
Parking our car was a hassle| took 20 minutes to find spot in garage. Very surprised no complimentary coffee/tea for guests in lobby.,Dec 29| 2018,4
Not great experience,Dec 29| 2018,2
Great location to Newark Airport and the shuttle to airport and the rail link to NYC made the hotel only about 30 minutes to Penn Station.,Dec 29| 2018,5
functional hotel near EWR airport.  not much more to say.  Sunday food options are very limited as the restaurant is closed.,Dec 29| 2018,3
The overall hotel was really nice.but parking was terrible..theres a separate fee for parking on top of the room fee..why? And to actually find parking is almost impossible,Dec 28| 2018,4
Parking was a nightmare there was no where to park and a security attendant outside told us to ride around and wait for a spot it could be an hour or a couple hours. Are you kidding me.. This is the reason for this review,Dec 28| 2018,2
Perfect ambient clean rooms super comfort bed and friendly staff,Dec 27| 2018,5
Good staff. Rooms could use better lighting. ............................................,Dec 27| 2018,4
If you don't want to pay high Manhattan hotel prices| and don't mind taking a little time to get there from Jersey| this is a great place to stay!  The free hotel shuttle runs to and from the hotel every 20 minutes 24 hours a day to the airport where you can get the train to New York Penn station.  The hotel staff is very nice and helpful.  I thought the breakfast buffet was overpriced| but it was good and the wait staff was excellent.  The only downside to this hotel is that there is NOTHING around it as far as restaurants| drug stores| markets shopping| etc.  Those are accessible by Uber| Lyft| or cab| though.,Dec 23| 2018,4
Great hotel| on site parking and friendly staff... Highly recommend.,Dec 22| 2018,4
Carpet was sticky - not what you want with bare feet. Wet corner of the rug near the fan and it's heating season| so AC etc shouldn't be leaking. Bathroom door only opened halfway because it hit the toilet. Super thin blanket on the bed. Not a picky hotel stayer| but this Hilton experience left me pretty disappointed.,Dec 19| 2018,2
I enjoyed my stay and there wasn't anything worth complaining about.,Dec 17| 2018,4
Because my grandkids love the pool.,Dec 16| 2018,5
Remember the shuttle that’s available. Wonderful staff! Great pillows.,Dec 16| 2018,5
Check in was easy| bed cozy and comfortable and the airport shuttle was very convenient.,Dec 15| 2018,4
Convenient location. A nice| clean| updated and quiet room with helpful staff.,Dec 13| 2018,4
Good clean professional nice folks and continue to use Hilton properties,Dec 12| 2018,3
Nice room. Bathroom/shower ceiling needs some work. The food in the restaurant was Horrible and very expensive!,Dec 10| 2018,3
Great stay bar| food awesome| staff friendly professional,Dec 10| 2018,5
Love that they have everything on the premises Starbucks| restaurants airport parking,Dec 8| 2018,5
The amenities and accommodations are Hilton best standard in this site. Starbucks is really a plus for us. Though sometimes the problem is with the staff. In a shuttle service| we were asked by the driver (Aida)to leave our seats and wait for the next shuttle in courtesy with the airline crews. Really...don't know that's the new Hilton policy. We feel it is a race issue as we were the only Asian on this trip. For reference| we stayed at this hotel from November 29-December 4 Room 622 and a Hilton Honors member. Hope the management will check this situation to be fair with paying customers like us...,Dec 4| 2018,4
Clean well kept property| room was very clean and comfortable| staff was very nice,Dec 2| 2018,5
Pleasant front desk staffShuttle long waits and dirty,Dec 1| 2018,4
When you go to pool is warm but the air conditioning is turn on and your freezing when you get out. I was surprise they charge you 21 dollar a person instead of free breakfast buffet. Also since you check in at 4 pm and checkout 11 am you actually lose two hour in the hotel. Just something I notice the bed was relaxing,Nov 29| 2018,2
Great,Nov 29| 2018,5
My room was clean and the bed was comfortable| although some of the bathroom floor tiles were loose and needed to be re-grouted. The decor in the room and the restaurant is tired and dated and should be refreshed. The staff was great| though| and the airport shuttle was very convenient| running every 20 minutes.,Nov 26| 2018,4
Front desk was friendly. Room was clean| but bathtub clogged.,Nov 25| 2018,4
Everything was good except checkin.  They somehow lost our reservation and it took a long time to correct.  Else place was fine.,Nov 24| 2018,3
The staff went above and beyond too accommodate my family for our stay. My newlywed cousins were so happy with the service and attention to details.,Nov 23| 2018,5
Loved it. Big clean roon. With everything you need.,Nov 19| 2018,5
shouldn’t have to pay for parking if you’re staying there...it’s not NYC,Nov 17| 2018,3
Comfortable and convenient. One mile away from Newark Airport. Shuttle to and from the airport every twenty minutes.,Nov 13| 2018,4
It was average experience. Nothing special about it.,Nov 9| 2018,5
The property was clean the grand entrance was really nice your staff is friendly will manage. The only thing was the bathroom of room 715 you cannot open the bathroom door fully if the toilet led was down I found that strange.,Nov 9| 2018,4
The hotel is very old with terrible amenities. The furniture were worn out| the bathroom faucet didn't work and the service was really bad... oh mine... can't be worse!!!,Nov 3| 2018,1
Nice hotel close to the airport.  Comfortable rooms,Oct 31| 2018,5
it’s too complicated to get into nyc| need to simplify; the hotel and room are great. i like it there.,Oct 28| 2018,4
Excellent hotel staff and airport shuttle drivers. Everyone was very helpful and professional.,Oct 25| 2018,5
Rooms probably need some updating but overall rooms are comfortable.,Oct 23| 2018,5
I cannot believe they do not have a microwave in their rooms. Also the fridge is always off so you have to turn it in before using it.,Oct 23| 2018,1
Convenient to airport| quick check in and out| friendly efficient staff,Oct 23| 2018,5
Front desk staffs are pretty busy and rushing with customers.  They didn’t explain about their hotel’s ammenities. I also have to wait 10 min to get a help from a bell captain.,Oct 22| 2018,3
空港から近く、シャトルがあり便利なのですが、それ以外はあまり利点が思いつきません。建物は古く、部屋は暗い、水周りは排水管？のにおいが気になりました。ソファやカーテンのシミもたくさんあり気になりました。ホテルの周りは何もありません。寝るだけで、あまり細かいところが気にならないという方はいいかもしれませんが、私は次は違うところに泊まります。,Oct 20| 2018,3
The property is clean and in good condition| and it is a good location for those flying into or out of Newark International Airport.  The staff was friendly and professional as well.,Oct 15| 2018,4
Nicely designed. Restaurant was way over priced and not really family friendly. Beds were small and not very comfortable.,Oct 14| 2018,3
Hotel was very close to the airport which made it great for an early departure. But their is nothing closer to the hotel| we had to take the train into the city to find lunch a d dinner.Shuttle service was great,Oct 14| 2018,4
There is no 24 hour room service despite restaurants and bars being far away. There was no complimentary parking. Additional the price was very high.,Oct 13| 2018,3
Excellent| always come back there Excelent hotel | employees | great room and help me with late check out,Oct 10| 2018,5
Could have used an extra blanket and there were no towels in the bathroom but quickly sent up when requested. but other than that everything was perfect.  Very nice and relaxing atmosphere.,Oct 6| 2018,4
It was a nice hotel.   Clean and friendly staff.We missed the shuttle by 2 minute and had to wait 28 minutes for the next shuttle and it was pretty full we had to push our way to get on it.   Wished shuttle had a sign up list so those who are early get on without having to fight for a ride.    There is nothing around here to eat at and hotel food was very expensive.   Had to order out.,Oct 1| 2018,4
Wasn’t asked about Hilton Honours or room preference. Was given room with 2 small beds instead of one larger bed.,Oct 1| 2018,2
The front desk staff was very professional and nice| even the housekeeping staff was very nice too.,Sep 30| 2018,4
Convenient location for getting in and out of NYC. Quiet and clean.,Sep 30| 2018,4
Easy place to stop if you are arriving off a flight in the middle of the night and want to get to sleep.,Sep 28| 2018,3
Staff was great| but the hotel's definitely a little run down. Nothing worth complaining about| but just not the best place I've ever stayed. Would stay there again due to convenience| but not for the hotel itself.,Sep 24| 2018,3
Our check in representative was polite| efficient| knowledgeable and answered every question and concern with the service attitude that it was a pleasure to serve us. So rare these days,Sep 24| 2018,5
Good location close to EWR. Good service but needs to add parking and/or breakfast with reduced rates,Sep 24| 2018,4
Room nice.... A bit Dusty...clock radio not working... room Dusty....,Sep 23| 2018,4
The staff were friendly. Beds were comfy. No complaints at all.,Sep 23| 2018,4
It was a hotel of convenience.,Sep 20| 2018,3
We stayed here for a night after our vacation and before our flight home. It was exactly what we needed. Clean| comfortable and roomy.,Sep 20| 2018,5
Room was dusty... No Bueno for an allergy sufferer..,Sep 16| 2018,4
Room was good with a comfortable bed and quiet. Hotel is fairly isolated with not much within walking distance| so you are pretty much confined there for meals. Dinner was good| but expensive. Breakfast should be part of the room price|but wasn't for us. $22 per person is too much for a typical 'free' hotel breakfast. Because of this| I would stay elsewhere the next time.,Sep 14| 2018,4
Service was good. Hotel was a bit old and dated. There is free shuttle to airport.,Sep 14| 2018,4
Curtain was one large blackout curtains so no middle line of sunlight. They allowed a late check-out.The staff were patient and courteous and the airport shuttle was prompt with beyond helpful drivers. Very happy withy stay.,Sep 12| 2018,5
Check in staff was rude and appeared annoyed I used Expedia.,Sep 8| 2018,3
Great place to stay| great service y comfort  ! Thank you!,Sep 1| 2018,5
Got exactly what I booked. Close to EWR and good if you need a night in transit.,Aug 29| 2018,4
The room was extremely comfortable| spacious| comfy beds and super clean bathrooms. We stayed in the room the entire stay due to late departure| it was a pleasure staying in.,Aug 27| 2018,5
nice room and dinner was good not happy about paying to park my car,Aug 26| 2018,4
Comfortable bed| shower felt great...soaps great| breakfast great,Aug 23| 2018,4
Perfect place to stay that is close to EWR. I stayed there at the end of a long weekend in upstate NY. Drove to Newark airport to return my rental car. I hopped on te EWR Tram to catch the free shuttle| checked in and had a wonderful night sleep. Got up early and headed back to EWR to catch an early flight home. It was so convenient and pleasant.

The Hilton Newark Airport hotel was GREAT!  We arrived on the later side but they allowed us to order room service and we had a drink in their very cozy lounge while we waited for it.  The front desk associate who helped us was fantastic.  She was friendly and went out of our way to to help us.  The room was very comfortable and had everything we needed.,Aug 5| 2018,5
El Hotel muy bonito y limpio| cerca del aeropuerto pero mil vueltas para llegar en carro. Hice la reserva con Expedia y solo me llego un correo en el que decía que estaba hecha la reserva sin número de confirmación y sin la dirección del hotel ni el correo del Horel por lo que no me pude comunicar con ellos.El Hotel muy bonito .,Jul 27| 2021,5

I had a great stay. I would highly recommend.,Aug 10| 2021,5
nice place to stay,Aug 10| 2021,4
Certain staff members were unpleasant. Not friendly| not helpful and sort of rude. When we walked in we stood for a bit before anyone addresses us. I asked for a bandaid and was quickly told without looking “we are all out”. There was one very friendly man| but the other woman we interacted with was not. The room service was great and quick| but the staff at the hotel was very unpleasant.,Aug 9| 2021,3
Great location. Clean rooms and friendly service.,Aug 8| 2021,5
Great  area! A lot of good restaurants shopping and things to do,Aug 3| 2021,3
HGI in Tribeca was one of the most disappointing properties I have stayed at| I have stayed at several. The staff were unfriendly| the location on the border of nice parts of SoHo and a trashy street. The TV was old and remote barely worked| the lock on the door was broken| I could even close the door half the time with out messing with the lock on the inside for several minutes. I got placed next to a noisy supply closet where workers opened| moved things around| and slammed the door. The toilet had issues flushing| the nob on the shower to control heat was also on the fritz.  I love Hilton| but not this property.,Jul 27| 2021,2
It’s a great hotel to stay at in SoHo!,Jul 26| 2021,5
Do not like that there is no parking on site nor does it say that to the customer booking.,Jul 20| 2021,3

Desk staff was awesome!  Really went the extra mile (early check-in; late check-out).  Still recovering from Covid| so no daily room cleaning| etc.  Had to ask for linens; no coffee in the morning| but they were just coming back into normal when we left.  Great bunch of people.,Jul 9| 2021,5

Everything was fine except for the 2nd day of my stay the water was out for about 8 hours. It felt a little rude to not give us an accurate timeline of when it would be returned. Also| my hot water since that incident was hit or miss.,Jun 15| 2021,3
Front desk staff was rude| shower was cold| toilet was semi functional| running for 10 mins with each flush,May 10| 2021,2

Great location| good for families.,May 7| 2021,5
The stay was mostly fine and the guest services staff were pleasant| but there wasn't anything spectacular about the stay. The decor is outdated so it was tough to tell if surfaces and areas like the carpet were clean or just old.,Apr 27| 2021,4
Clean| comfortable room. Convenient location and friendly staff but neighborhood has deteriorated (trash| graffiti) due to DeBlasio and City Council lack of care and maintenance.,Apr 22| 2021,5
Rooms were clean| staff was friendly| and the location was very convenient. You can't ask for much more than that.,Apr 15| 2021,4
Who ever stayed in the room before us their shoes were under the bed. The toilet took a few times to flush,Apr 13| 2021,5
Amazing location in the heart of Tribeca. Walkable to soho| west village| east village| chinatown| etc. Very nice staff| felt safe COVID-wise. A little threadbare -- a couple holes in the shade etc -- & showing some age but a good deal when it's cheap.,Apr 12| 2021,4
Very easy checkin| staff was very friendly and courteous| great view of W Broadway.,Apr 7| 2021,5
Great location and very helpful staff. The beds were way too soft and seemed old.,Apr 7| 2021,4
This place was alright. Nothing too fancy| nothing too shabby. It was clean on arrival| the whole stay I made sure to bring Lysol and alcohol wipes for my own reassurance. T.V was nice to have| I liked that the heat/AC worked. I didn’t ever get the WiFi password. There wasn’t any hand soap| but lucky for me I bring EVERYTHING when I travel. So for me I didn’t make myself known when I was there. Didn’t really asked/needed anything. The elevator was sketchy to begin with| at some point in the night the elevator got stuck. They ended up getting it open| so we have to use the stairs to that point. The location of the hotel is it for me. I would check in again because I like the location| right near the subway. I liked it| nothing really to complain about. If you are looking for just the necessities of a stay| this Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca is it,Apr 4| 2021,3
Our stay was perfect! We got to the hotel on Friday and ended up being able to park all weekend on the street for free. We only ended up using the paid parking for one day but figured out by the street signs you could park for certain hours so it worked out. Upon getting there we,Apr 1| 2021,5
Rooms are too small| comfy beds but too tight for a family of 4. Overall good experience.,Apr 1| 2021,4
The Staff Was Phenomenal The Hôtel Is Very Cleaned Everything Was Convenient  I Iove 💘 It,Apr 1| 2021,5
The staff at this hotel was one of the worst to date! My boyfriend stayed here for a work trip and called me immediately after checking in to fill me in in the attitude of the front desk lady. She was rude| not welcoming and aggressive. He had questions for her about his reservations and she was less than interested to answer anything. Would’ve much rather stay somewhere where you actually feel WELCOMED at the hotel.,Mar 26| 2021,1
It was a very nice hotel| very clean. It was super quiet which made for a good little get away,Mar 12| 2021,5
Convenient to the areaWe were visiting by walking,Mar 8| 2021,4
The room was big and spacious. No modern walk in shower| but it wasn't bad| tub and shower head. Due to the pandemic| the rooms haven't been used in months so you gotta wait 20 minutes for the hot water to rise. After that it was pretty smooth. They have nice mirrors. Great staff. Wonderful time.,Mar 5| 2021,4
All was well with our stay. Friendly staff and a calm environment. Definitely staying again.,Jan 19| 2021,5
Cozy hotel in a great location! Microwave in the room was very helpful.,Jan 19| 2021,5
The hotel was basically empty when we went which is okay but some of the services was terrible. The was no hot water in the showers and had to let the water run for 20 minutes. The hallways were cold and the heat was not turned on. The heat in the room did not work properly. I think it was fair for the price,Jan 11| 2021,2
Everything was lovely and clean. I got a room with a view. It’s really close to China town but about a 30-40 minute walk to Rockefeller center. We enjoyed the walking to Rockefeller center because we went through 5th ave and was able to shop. Once you remove your car from the parking garage you have to pay another $30. So we had just parked our car for 3 hours and then wanted to use it and they charged us $30 when it’s 24 hour parking because we removed the car.,Dec 30| 2020,5
Loved that it was clean| great staff| very helpfully and amazing,Nov 28| 2020,5
There was no parking availalbe unless you could find it on the street.  Otherwise yo uhad to go to parking garage at a distance from the hotel. No valet available,Nov 23| 2020,4
Great location| secure| and free parking in surrounding streets starting at 6 p.m. on Friday nights (for the weekend).,Oct 22| 2020,5
Property was neat and clean. Great location as well. I would def recommend/stay there again.,Oct 20| 2020,4
Very clean and friendly staff. Spacious room. Thank you!,Oct 16| 2020,5
Most things were fine. I do wish the staff would wear masks at all times when in the common spaces of the building though. Covid is airborne| so putting on your masks only when a client walks in doesn’t help nearly as much as wearing them all the time would. The maid on 5 didn’t seem to have a mask at all,Oct 15| 2020,4
This hotel is amazing. It is so clean and sanitized. They took extreme measures to make sure their guests stayed covid free. Our room was literally sealed shut with a sticker that said it was sanitized. The front desk was helpful and quick. Will definitely stay here again,Oct 6| 2020,5
Great hotel with a great location!Very Clean!,Oct 5| 2020,5
Nice place to stay,Oct 5| 2020,5
Great location| near to the subway and many options for eating out but don't take it for breakfast available because you'll have a surprise when they say that They haven't offered since the pandemic began and the other negative was the mattress| very uncomfortable,Oct 4| 2020,2
The room was just wonderful| very large and so comfortable| a perfect home away from home during an extended stay. The hotel staff was so helpful. The location was perfect.,Sep 25| 2020,5

Very clean| very friendly| very accommodating| will be staying here again,Sep 5| 2020,5
Upon Initial entry of the hotel you’ll need to be buzzed into the building. Your room key will be how you enter the building afterwards which was no big deal. I’m assuming it was for safety reasons although Tribeca is a good neighborhood. Once check in was complete & we made our way to the room we could not get in. This was very upsetting considering the long drive & late arrival time. We just wanted to take a shower & rest. But we Had to carry our luggages BACK downstairs to receptionist & were reassigned a new room. The room itself were fine. No complaints there. One last complaint is the address the receptionist gave us That they use for parking (which would have been approx 5min walk IF the place really existed) turned out to be a residential building. So that was a huge disappointment because we were stuck driving around searching for parking and ultimately paid elsewhere more than what we expected. Overall I would stay again BUT probably would prefer to not have a vehicle that need parking.,Sep 4| 2020,3
In the time of Covid-19| I think they have done a nice job. Sealed doors with cleaning labels along with labels on the remotes and other surfaces signaling that they’ve been cleaned is very reassuring. Good location. The interior is a bit on the older side. The only thing that I didn’t like was actually securing a room. It listed many options (all very similar) but with different price points. I chose the king with a view. When I checked in| I asked for a quiet room away from the elevators. I was placed on the second floor across from the elevator. Right above street level and near elevator. Also the ac didn’t seem to work very well. I went back down to the lobby and requested a different room. When I said that it wasn’t what I requested| the lady told me that’s what I booked online. None of it made any sense. Least of all since there were over a hundred rooms in the building. Why would there only be the corner rooms with a view| especially if it’s of the street. I don’t know. But the lobbyist wasn’t very friendly or helpful.,Aug 22| 2020,4
The check wasn’t as good as my first stay but nevertheless I enjoyed myself. The room was very clean and the the floor was quiet throughout the night.,Aug 17| 2020,5
Put on hold multiple time every time guest walked in. At the end decided to hang up the phone as was tired of waiting.Expedia also mess up my reservation and hotel could never located my reservation. Was given all kind of excuses. At the end I had to make another reservation at the same hotel - last minute deal - I had to speak to another Expedia dept to work with hotel because they wanted to charge more. Very bad experience. This is the 2nd time in row I have issues with making my reservation thru Expedia.,Aug 17| 2020,1
The staff were polite friendly and very helpful and accomodating allowed me to sleep in 2hrs after check out very secure safe area we loved our stay excellent food options nearby,Aug 12| 2020,5
There was a cockroach in the bathtub.,Aug 12| 2020,3
So I stayed here July 29- July 30. I didn’t feel like going home after my trip from Vegas and was going to stay here a few nights. Well guess who checked out the next morning? I did. The first room I was given seemed off it didn’t have any sanitary seals on it even after I was assured it’s cleanliness. I was told “nobody had stayed on the 2nd floor for a while| just make sure you let the water run first so it can get warm”. That was room 228. There was a cockroach or water bug on the stomped on the floor next to the bed. I will insert a picture. WiFi wasn’t working at all even in the other room I was given| my boyfriend was pissed he couldn’t play his game. The heater/ ac unit in room 228 was not upgraded I almost threw up when it wouldn’t turn off. The sheets had stains and to be honest so did one of the towels. I was changed to room 522. It was much better everything seemed clean and it had sanitary seals on everything. Only thing I can complain was there was no WiFi in 522,Jul 31| 2020,3
Alena at the front desk was beyond great! The rooms are super duper clean. The area has lots of restaurants and the subway is right outside. I would definitely recommend this hotel.,Jul 31| 2020,5
Your website I suppose is not up to date with the Hilton  garden inn I had my aunt book me a reservation got off my long flight to be told I could not put down a security deposit in cash (50$) nor would they let me call in the numbers over the phone from the same card the room was payed for a reserved under so I am out 100 dollars and no hotel.,Jul 29| 2020,1
Great location| super friendly staff. Clean and spacious room(for New York.) My only complaint| is the fire alarm went off twice at 3:30am..so much for a good night's sleep. We did not have to vacate our room| but it was disruptive none the less.,Jul 28| 2020,4
Very clean hotel especially with this COVID 19.   I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice location with great service.,Jul 26| 2020,4

Room was very clean and organized. But their deposit per stay which is 50 dollar is too much as my point of view.but everything else was very nice and the area also,Jul 14| 2020,4

Not too sold on the location but its very close to transportation. Other than that| I was VERY pleased.,Jun 1| 2020,5
This is a very nice hotel. Quiet (the doors are solid and seem to seal out ambient noise well).,Jun 1| 2020,5
I loved everything about it and thy also don’t mind helping I love it,May 27| 2020,5
Me and my wife went to get away for a few days. Good amount of space. The bathroom was okay| wish it was more modern. The tv is extremely small for the space of the room. I wanted to stay here because of the microwave and fridge which is a necessity when staying for more than one night. When the toilet got stopped up and the lady came up quickly which was great. Furniture was old and dated. If your on a quick trip I would recommend! But i have been to other places that was more modern and the same price. love the area| I use to work in the area so it was convenient. Good hotel for those who aren’t as picky as I am lol,May 24| 2020,3
It was very clean and the Lady at the reception area was very nice and cordial,May 22| 2020,5

This was very accessible for a girls weekend to visit NYC| Tribeca| Battery Park| 9/11 Museum and memorial. Everything we wanted was walkable within 10-15 mins| easy cab right home in evening. Fabulous Italian restaurant directly across the street - highly recommend! The bar onsite was busy and fun| open for breakfast in the morning. Overall great stay.,Mar 18| 2020,5
Located in TriBeCa| with a subway station almost at the entrance. 15 mn walk from World Trade Center. Rooms are spacious but slightly older. Staff is very helpful.,Mar 8| 2020,5
I stayed at Hilton some another state I never had this experienced before. First of all| someone who works at front no greeting and no smile| and first night outside was 34F our room was very cold heater wasn’t work... that day before we check out I asked front for call Taxi to Airport next morning she said she will call them soon.... I think no one call for us. Next morning another front lady said they don’t do call taxi!!!!!!!????? They call car service they charged us $70  regular taxi is flat rate $55 to airport. I think they let us use one of car service provide at hotel. Property location was great that’s all!,Mar 6| 2020,2
Staff very professional| courteous... room in very good condition| clean,Mar 2| 2020,5
Normal Hilton hotel. No major problem. The basics are covered. Location is great| right next to subway entrance. The woman who checked me in had a lot of attitude| rolling eyes| and very unpleasant answering my questions.,Feb 24| 2020,1
The unique of this property is the location| next to the subway station.The beds in the room where very uncomfortable,Feb 19| 2020,3
Front desk ladies were beyond welcoming and made me feel welcomed,Feb 19| 2020,5
We had a really nice view from our room| the staff is very friendly and helpful. Everyone was very kind about my service dog.,Feb 16| 2020,5
The staff were absolutely wonderful and went above and beyond.  Super friendly.  I asked for a quiet room and they found one (you can have a view| or it can be quiet--again| for New York| not like you're in the country). The room was large for New York| water pressure good.  Bed was ok.Downsides: someone mentioned deferred maintenance -- that's also true though nothing was an actual problem.  The walls are that institutional beige that NYC hotels love to use and paper thin| so you will hear what's happening in the hallway.  Oh| and they throttle the "free" internet to try and get you to pay.  All of these complaints are very minor| but you might want to know about them.Go in with reasonable expectations and you'll have a nice stay.  I certainly did!,Feb 15| 2020,4
We stayed overnight for a pizza class and movie.  Staff was amazing- had room ready early and car valet was so friendly.  Hotel looked great.,Feb 12| 2020,5
very convenient location| close to Hudson river & subway| just below soho and above downtown. On checkin| ask for room with street view,Feb 8| 2020,5
It was a very nice hotel.  Good bar and grill| however disappointed that it closes so early on a Saturday night.  Otherwise everything else was great.,Jan 27| 2020,5
I had the snack premium in my stay and the service was not given.,Jan 24| 2020,4
There was some confusion with the rooms when I checked in| however| they were helpful. The valet service| on the other hand| could be better. My car's bumper was scratched when it was returned.,Jan 22| 2020,3
This hotel is an amazing deal! The location is wonderful| the price is right| the staff is so friendly and helpful| and the rooms are nice and cozy. It also has a gym! I would stay here again in a heartbeat.,Jan 22| 2020,5
Great location and value in NYC. Easy walk to most places of relevance in city,Jan 21| 2020,5
The staff at the front desk| the doorman/concierge| and the waiter in the restsurant were all very friendly  and helpful. The location was also convenient -- for the subway and sites in and near Tribeca. Walking distance to the Whitney and the Highline.,Jan 21| 2020,5
Fantastic location for financial| Tribeca| and Soho areas.,Jan 20| 2020,4
The location was excellent|  Very close to the corner of 6th avenue  (A.K.A. Avenue of the Americas)  and Canal Street in Manhattan.  It was a 15 minute walk to the 9-11 memorial museum and maybe twenty minutes to Greenwich Village.   The subway entrance was a few hundred feet from the hotel and was a straight shot (no transfers into Times Square and the Rockefeller center.  The subway was also a straight shot to Roosevelt in Queens with a quick express bus transfer to LaGuardia.  $6.00 cost to get to the airport sure beats the cost of a taxi.The hotel was clean and the staff friendly and helpful.   I would definitely recommend.,Jan 17| 2020,4
Our recent stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca was great!  The staff were all welcoming and very helpful.  The room was small which is typical for NYC but with good amenities. Would stay here again.,Jan 15| 2020,5
The room was clean which is most important to me. But the hotel was overbooked for rooms with king beds and I was given a room with two double beds| and not refunded the extra $7 I paid to reserve the king room (obviously not a huge deal but would've been nice). Overall was acceptable. I much prefer the Hilton Garden in Financial district| though.Also a random note.... The mattresses were pillow top but both were flipped so that the soft side was facing the floor..... sorta weird. Comfortable nonetheless.,Jan 6| 2020,4
Location| street view| didn’t get the room expected| compensated with complimentary breakfast,Jan 6| 2020,5
Property is an excellent location. Easy access to trains| food| and perfect walking distance to china town or little italy. Staff was super friendly. Far enough away from the crazy commotion of NYC but trains are so easily accessed traversing the city is easy.,Jan 4| 2020,5
Clean but the beds are hard as a rock and the pillows are so flat you might as well not have a pillow at all. The coffee and amenities were not good. I ran out after one cup and then received other gross powder creamer and no stevia after that| even though it was requested.,Jan 3| 2020,3
Our rating is 5 stars plus! From the moment we arrived until we left| the front desk staff was most helpful and courteous...and were more than happy to give us directions to anywhere. The room itself was nice and clean. "Pros" - (too many to mention). "Con" - the tv (which we really didn't have much time to watch): the remote was worn out and needs replaced. Also| maybe it was only the tv in our room| but the only local channels we could watch were 2 and 13. Channels 4| 7| 9| and 11| were "No Signal".   The restaurant (AOA Bar and Grill) was a bit pricey (probably normal NYC prices). We ate there twice for dinner and certainly did not leave hungry. They do feed you. However| we think their breakfast prices are too high| so we suggest you walk to Tribeca Bagels which is about a block away on the south side of Canal Street. It is a small place but is our favorite NYC restaurant.    Would we stay at Hilton Garden Inn again? YES!,Jan 3| 2020,5
We stayed at this hotel after seeing a show in Newark| so we arrived around 11pm. The ladies at the front desk were absolutely exceptional. The room was perfect size for our family of 4| which is not always the norm for NYC hotels. The attached restaurant had a nice buffet breakfast. Everyone we encountered was very friendly. We were very comfortable and will be back.,Dec 31| 2019,5
The flagpoles were right outside of our room’s windows and the didn’t seem properly secured. We constantly woke up to the flagpole shaking in the wind (much different than the sound of the flag itself blowing in the wind).The cleaning crew would let the doors slam constantly as they would re-enter the rooms they were cleaning rather than leave the door open. This happened on both days of our trip with several rooms. We couldn’t sleep and had to leave.Otherwise| the facility was clean and pleasant with great proximity to the A C E.,Dec 31| 2019,3
The hotel is right next to the Canal St subway station| which was super convenient. I felt safe walking in the immediate area of the hotel. The hotel itself is pretty much what you’d expect. Smaller rooms and lobby - nothing special but does the job. Free coffee and tea in the mornings was a plus| but otherwise don’t expect anything else. I asked the front desk if they had a makeup remover wipe and they said they don’t provide anything beyond the shampoo| condition| soap| and lotion in our room. AC in our room was a bit noisy| beds were ok. Shower did get very hot. One tip I would offer future guests is to lock up your luggage and medications while you are away. Both of the people we traveled with came back to their room with an open bag in a different position/spot than how they left it.,Dec 30| 2019,4
Good,Dec 29| 2019,4
I like the location it was very close to everything we wanted to see!,Dec 28| 2019,4
Excellent,Dec 27| 2019,5

Excellent location.  Friendly and helpful staff. Clean| comfortable room.  Will definitely stay here again,Dec 24| 2019,5
Nice hotel. Very clean and safe. Subway station 50 feet from the front door.Good location.,Dec 24| 2019,5
excellent. Little issue: very noisy outside. Difficult to regulate temperature and noise.,Dec 22| 2019,4
Good location. Easy to get to SoHo shops. Staff was friendly and helpful in giving information and directions.,Dec 18| 2019,5
It was a nice stay with my family for a few nights.  They provided a pack n play as their infant bed (crib) which worked out great.  There was a subway station in the front of the hotel| a Starbucks across the street as well as a food cart with coffee/donut,Dec 3| 2019,5
It was definitely a nice hotel for the price and I liked the location.,Nov 28| 2019,5
Very good location| bad ventilation and cleaning system.,Nov 23| 2019,3
property was very clean| staff very courteous and helpful - only problem was cab drivers didn't quite know where it was given the address of 39 Avenue of the Americas!  Better to tell them near 6th and Canal!,Nov 15| 2019,5
Good location| good standard of cleanliness and good rooms but very tired and in want of a refurbish| especially the bathrooms,Nov 5| 2019,4
Staff friendly and went out of their way.Nice late night amenities. Would be nice to have newspapers available.,Nov 5| 2019,5
Close to everything walking distance to where I needed to go. The only thing I didn’t like was our room was facing the streets. The police cars the constant cars honking at nite and early morning.,Nov 4| 2019,5
Friendly staff great location right next to the subway,Nov 4| 2019,5
Great location. Hotel itself was alright - nothing special| and expensive for what it was.,Oct 31| 2019,3
The front desk and lobby staff were outstanding in both attitude and behavior; as usual as we have often stayed hereBut the breakfast buffet was a total loss: we didn’t know or saw where they offered cooked to order ometettes or belgian waffles until nearly done when waiter offered to adjacent. Coffee wasn’t refilled unless we askedSo SKIP BUFFET,Oct 29| 2019,4
It was clean and the staff were very welcoming! We have absolutely no complaints about our stay,Oct 29| 2019,5
Great location! Room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The room was a bit small. The bathroom lighting is awful and the hair dryer was broken but even if it worked it was awful. They responded quickly and provided a replacement . They text to check in on how things are going| which is nice. Staff was very friendly and professional. The free coffee was awful!! ( decaf). I would stay again in spite of the things that weren’t wonderful.,Oct 28| 2019,4
Great business hotel. Location accessible to most of lower Manhattan by cab| easy to get. Room very comfortable| quiet| and dark. Would stay here again.,Oct 24| 2019,4
As a former New Yorker| I had a great time staying in this hotel. Amazing location and easy to commute by Sab or walking! overall great experience. Would go back there.,Oct 21| 2019,5
Fantastic hotel! Clean| well-maintained| super friendly and helpful staff| comfortable| and in a safe area. Highly recommend for either business or personal trips.,Oct 18| 2019,5
I had a very good time.,Oct 16| 2019,5
This was our first stay at the Hilton Tribeca (we typically stay around the corner at the Sheraton Tribeca.) Love the location super close to our favorite parts of the city (Soho| Chinatown| Little Italy and Tribeca) but also walkable to LES and even The Village. There are also really good transit options to get to more places. Having a restaurant on site is super convenient even though we didn’t use it. The bedroom and bathroom were very spacious ESPECIALLY for NYC. It also clean and decently lit. The bed wasn’t the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in but it was fine. Overall| a good place for sleeping/showering between your NYC adventures.,Oct 15| 2019,4
My daughter and I stayed five nights at beginning of October. We felt totally safe in and around hotel. Subway station for lines A| C| and E right next door.,Oct 11| 2019,5
The receptionists were amazing and hotel was clean.,Oct 6| 2019,5
This hotel was great. Centrally located| close to the subway and walking distance to many attractions. Staff was lovely and helpful. Room size was good for NY and things were comfortable. Would stay again in a heartbeat.,Oct 4| 2019,5
Great location| efficient and welcoming staff| easy check-in| complete basic amenities| NO “RESORT FEE”,Oct 2| 2019,5
The property was so convenient to the subway and the cab service was easily available.  We were close to great dining and in walking distance to shopping and restaurants.,Oct 1| 2019,5
We stayed 1 night. Bar & Grill connected to hotel was nice. We are from PA so to exit the city and go home was awesome!,Sep 30| 2019,5
Offered me a quiet room| and it was a game-changer. Great location| clean| modern. Staff wasn't the friendliest| but that's fine.,Sep 26| 2019,4
room alarm kept on going off| first night went off again at 3 am and they took it away but couldn't get back to sleep,Sep 25| 2019,4
I've stayed in many Manhattan hotels| but this one is tops. The room was spotless| quiet| comfortable| convenient| and the staff were all friendly and very helpful| meaning every questioin answered and every request filled. I'll definitely stay in this hotel again.,Sep 25| 2019,5
The staff were all so kind and went out of their way to accommodate me and make me feel welcome and make sure we had everything we needed to have an awesome stay!,Sep 22| 2019,4
Great location and very friendly staff! Would definitely stay here again.,Sep 21| 2019,5
Great time.  Hotel very convenient with subway stop right outside and another one a few blocks away.  o much better to stay in Tribeca-Soho area rather than uptown.  If you have to be in Times Square| Penn Station| Port Authority|  the subway lines CEA all run directly there.,Sep 9| 2019,5
Perfect location| walkable from various attractions| subway station just outside the hotel. Clean rooms| feels bit old| but nice. Staff is always smiling and welcoming,Sep 8| 2019,5
All good except at moving in the A/C system was emitting black smoke. It got quickly fixed though.,Sep 7| 2019,4
Staff and place its really nice and will go back again,Sep 3| 2019,5
the room is a little compact BUT had all amenities and I slept great! ITS REALLY CLOSE to shopping,Sep 3| 2019,4
Nice| close to subway lines| walking distance to many attractions.,Sep 2| 2019,4
No Parking in the Hotel and charged too much to park one day.,Sep 1| 2019,3
Staff waa professional and accomodating. Did not liake the gact that there is no parking and valet parking is $75.00 per day.,Aug 27| 2019,5
This hotel is perfect if you're driving into NYC. Just a qtr mi past Holland Tunnel and offering Valet Parking. The room and service were excellent. I will definitely stay here again.,Aug 26| 2019,5
Good location. Clean room. Nice staff. Good reastaurant and bar in the building.,Aug 21| 2019,5
The front desk staff was friendly and really helpful in answering our questions about the area.,Aug 20| 2019,5
If you want to live like a local in TriBeCa| stay in this hotel—I should know because I lived in the neighborhood for 30 years and I am now returning as a visitor. It’s very convenient to all the experiences that give Tribeca it’s charm and convenience. The rooms facing the street are amazingly quiet and large enough for our family of three.,Aug 19| 2019,5
It was just Ok.  It was clean and nice to go to sleep.   And it was near my meetings place.,Aug 18| 2019,4
Great service| and clean room.,Aug 15| 2019,5
Convenient location| easy access to subway and Chinatown| overall a good stay,Aug 13| 2019,4
First room I received stunk of cigarettes,Aug 10| 2019,2
Is very clean I love it| nice personal they attended me very respectfully,Aug 9| 2019,5
Staff was wonderful and the location is ideal| however| I think this hotel is due for a renovation. The carpet was musky and the room overall had a pungent odour.,Aug 9| 2019,3
The stay was amazing. Only issue was the AC but the staff was great took care of the issue and made it up to us. Great walking distance to alot of attraction. Subway is right infront of the hotel. Just amazing.,Aug 7| 2019,5
The location is very convenient for the subway.  The mattress and bedding were all very comfortable.,Aug 6| 2019,5
Hotel is in a great location and easy to walk to many restaurants| tourist sights| the river| etc.  It's not fancy but it's clean and comfortable and the staff are super friendly.,Aug 5| 2019,4
Perfect place to stay| no complaints at all. Service was 5 stars.,Jul 30| 2019,5
very pleasant  great location room was clean,Jul 29| 2019,5
From the desk staff to the transportation help to the location - great place to stay.,Jul 24| 2019,5
This was great very nice staff n comfortable roomThe area is perfect and easy access to all of NYC,Jul 23| 2019,5
Location to Soho| Chinatown| and little Italy was good.  10 minute walk.  Noise was a big factor.  Street noise every night| sirens etc.  neighborhood was a little sketchy if you walked down the back streets so stay on the main roads.,Jul 22| 2019,4
Great location and value for this property.  Would stay again,Jul 22| 2019,5
We arrived at 2:30pm and the receptionist Karelin Bruno charged my credit card for 50$ without any explanation| and asked us to wait in the lobby because ‘there won’t be room ready until 3pm’. Shortly after we sit| many other people came and checked in before 3pm. I approached her again at 3pm| and she asked the last name and ID again for check in. I was very uncomfortable with her attitude.,Jul 21| 2019,1
In correct charge on days of valet parking.,Jul 18| 2019,3
My experience was good except that the room wasn't cleaned when I returned at 2:20 pm on two separate days.  The maid service was prompt once I asked.  I was told that they have until 6 pm to clean the rooms.  In fact| one maid opened the door on me during my visit to clean my room.  She apologized.  She didn't know that another maid cleaned the room for me at about 3 pm| but it wasn't a thorough cleaning.  She didn't wipe down the night tables| desk| and dressers or replace the napkins and stirrer packets.  It would be convenient to have a door sign that says the housekeeping service is requested. However| the front desk workers were friendly and helpful. I would definitely come back.,Jul 14| 2019,4
All went real well. I’d come back again. The bellman was awesome in providing ideas in and around Tribeca,Jul 13| 2019,5
Hotel somewhat dated.AC very loud (they are in room units).,Jul 12| 2019,3
When I first arrived| exhausted from a long drive and looking for a early check in| I was met by a welcoming smile. Jasmine was so helpful got my family checked in quickly| put us on the quiet side of the hotel and looked out for us during our stay. Jasmine and the staff were just AMAZING! Never stayed here before but definitely will be back| great room size| price and location.,Jul 12| 2019,5
The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful when we checked in/out and had questions. They set us up for a flat fee can to get back to the airport and when we got to the airport the cab driver ripped us off and would not honor that rate. The next day we called the hotel back and they made that cab company refund the difference! That was great. Only complaint is the lounge closes whenever it decides it wants to. We went to a play and before we left we asked how late they were open and were told 12| when we got back and walked in before 11 we were told they were closed,Jul 10| 2019,4
Staff was nice| room was clean| room was priced well,Jul 7| 2019,5
Staff was very welcoming and the hotel was very clean.,Jul 7| 2019,5
Clean and quiet...away from the city crowd.Beds were too soft though and it was difficult getting in and out of the shower because of the height of the jacuzzi. Did not see much of the hotel other than the room but the staff was incredibly friendly!,Jul 3| 2019,4
Great hotel in Tribeca!  Had a great stay there!,Jul 2| 2019,5
Great location| close to downtown| soho and China town area.,Jun 29| 2019,5
Good location between Tribeca & Soho but room was disappointing with dated décor| would suggest trying the vast selection a short walk away downtown.,Jun 26| 2019,2
Great,Jun 25| 2019,5
The location of the hotel is second to none. The Canal street subway exit is right outside the front door.,Jun 24| 2019,4
Room decor was nice; liked the large bathroom counter - room to put your stuff| but a small mirror on another wall would be nice for applying makeup.  Jacuzzi is a nice touch| but it’s high for getting in/out.  (I don’t know if there’s a choice on this when you book; my son booked just one week before arrival.). Coffee in lobby was appreciated; gentleman who hailed us a taxi was great,Jun 22| 2019,4
Great location| welcoming staff| nice view of Tribeca,Jun 17| 2019,4
This is a great hotel in an excellent area!  So many great places within a short walking distance.  This is my second time staying here and all the front desk employees are exceptional and are always cheerful and welcoming.  This is now my go to hotel when I go to NYC!,Jun 13| 2019,5
Location is great if you need to be downtown| rooms are spacious and a bit old school| but that's what I enjoyed most| was a easy going comfortable stay.  Can get a bit loud with traffic but welcome to New York City.,Jun 12| 2019,5
Property is well-priced for such a great location.  Rooms facing street are also surprisingly quiet.  With exception of clerk at check-in| front desk staff and concierge were exceptionally nice.,Jun 11| 2019,5
Great Neighborhood and great price. Would stay here again.,Jun 4| 2019,4
Everything was good but the girl at from desk was really nasty beyond professional! Her name was Krystal alleyneBecause of her I will never stay at that hotel again not recommend it.,Jun 2| 2019,1
It was a ok stay nothing amazing.  Parking was a pain since we had a car to park,Jun 1| 2019,3
Great location for our second trip to NYC.  Love the less hustle and bustle!  Would definitely stay here again!,May 28| 2019,5
We stayed two nights| extending our New York visit to over a week. The location was perfect| the staff was very friendly. The room was very comfortable and clean| with a nice view.,May 27| 2019,5
The service was fabulous as always - we had great help with everything including arranging transportation and holding our bags for us after checkout. We did have to wait pretty late to have our room made up once| but that's it| and  the house keeping folks are always willing to communicate with us. The entire staff is always friendly. In the connecting restaurant| Dananjo - not sure on the spelling but you can find him - is spectacular at breakfast in the morning. The whole crew is super. He's a big reason why we keep coming back. The location is perfect with the subway blue lines snug up to the hotel and the red lines a couple blocks away and other lines another block or two. The neighborhood is great and just keeps betting better - great blend of new high end and local working man restaurants. Lots of cool shops. There are two nice little parks on opposite ends of the block. Lower Broadway is about 3 blocks away. Super short and easy subway ride up to all uptown sites and back down toward 9/11 Memorial| Wall Street| Battery.,May 15| 2019,5
The hotel is very convenient to many great restaurants and attractions.  It is very quiet| great showers| and comfy beds.  The staff is always courteous and helpful.,May 14| 2019,5
This was a fantastic hotel and experience. Being this close to the Canal Street subway stops made getting around town so easy. The staff was friendly--everyone from Lisette (sp?) at check-in to the cleaning staff and handyman. We'll definitely stay here again when we come back to the city.,May 13| 2019,5
Polite| professional staff| clean accommodations| comfy beds| good coffee|  the room looked at a white brick wall but was very quiet. Worst hair dryer ever!,May 13| 2019,4
I was there for the Tribeca Film Festival so the location was perfect. I liked everything about this hotel!,May 5| 2019,5
This is a very nice reasonably priced hotel in the Tribeca area with a subway entrance right next to it for easy city transport. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and plan to return.,Apr 30| 2019,5
Great restaurant. Very nice staff. Crazy expensive parking though. That’s the only thing that would make me think twice about a return stay.,Apr 28| 2019,5
Great location and great service!! Staffs are very friendly.,Apr 24| 2019,5
Good breakfast| rooms are a little old| and its noisy on the main street.,Apr 24| 2019,3
The staff is very friendly and helpful. The hotel is very clean.,Apr 23| 2019,5
Good location.  Room view of a brick wall.  Should be less expensive for those rooms.  Staff should tell guests that the valet parking fee does not include tax.  That was an UNpleasant surprise.,Apr 16| 2019,4
Great location; near 3 subway lines and the Holland Tunnel.,Apr 15| 2019,5
This is a chain hotel that I expected would be just fine--not "top of the line|" but clean| comfortable and with a responsive staff. The odd feature that I didn't;t discover until midnight was that the curtains in the room were merely decorative--they did not function| and so I needed to sleep in a light-filled room. There was a light-permeable shade that could be lowered| but it did not block out light| only diffused it. I do not sleep well in a lighted room. I had not indication that I might have needed to ask for a room where it actually was dark when the lights were out. Next time I sleep in a Hilton| I will ask whether or not the curtains actually function.,Apr 8| 2019,3
Loved the location and knowledgeable| friendly staff.,Apr 1| 2019,5
Liked the convenience and location.Did not like that there is no "Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca" sign on the building.  Taxi/Uber had  a hard time finding the building.  There's a sign| but it faces the opposite way on the one way street.,Mar 27| 2019,5
The staff made sure that everything that we asked for was done politely and promptly.,Mar 27| 2019,5
I go often it is always good and orgsnized. They are always cordial and efficient,Mar 24| 2019,5
Can't beat price and location| no frills but clean and we'll maintained with friendly staff. Perfect home base for NYC.,Mar 24| 2019,5
I had a basically good stay.  It was quiet in my room| there were two beds as requested| and the cleaning staff was helpful.  When I returned home| however| all my clothes had to be washed (as did I) and both my husband and I had coughing| sneezing| and congestion.  I think| as a dog friendly hotel| that pillows| blankets| and carpeting are not as clean as they should be in that situation.  I don't know hotel policy on this| but even pillows and blankets must be washed after a dog stays in a room.  Good vacuuming and filters are also essential.  Many people have allergies and a clean room is essential. Better room lighting would also be nice.,Mar 18| 2019,4
Very close to 2 main subway lines. Hotel was very clean| restaurant connected was good. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Only thing is in the lobby| they always seems to run out of coffee.,Mar 17| 2019,5
EVERYTHING WAS CLEAN| EVERYONE WAS FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL,Mar 11| 2019,5
Clean| fast| comfortable. The gym was very small and all of the machines were in use when I went for morning exercise.,Mar 4| 2019,4
Grt position locationClean needs an updateStaff ver nice professional,Mar 2| 2019,4
Great location and very helpful staff | caring and thoughtful,Mar 1| 2019,5
The front lobby people| manager and the other staff were just amazing.   They went the extra mile when we had a couple of issues| not hotel related| to help us in every way.Definitely will stay there again.,Feb 26| 2019,5
I like the property and staff are amazing (especially Mark). However| I didn’t realize that when booking with Expedia| I’m not able to receive Hilton Honors points for my stay. So I forfeited A LOT of points for my last 2 stays. I will not be using Expedia again.,Feb 25| 2019,5
Needed peace and quite in a good hotel. Love Tribeca and surrounding area so this was perfect. Great overnight stay.,Feb 23| 2019,5
Good location close to shopping and restaurants Restraunt in hotel,Feb 22| 2019,5
Hotel staff was very helpful with directions as well as making recommendations for dinner. Location was convenient for where we needed to get| easy to access subway too. Hotel was clean and room was comfortable (especially for the price!),Feb 22| 2019,5
Expensive parking $85 bucks for 1 night,Feb 21| 2019,5
Location is good for my stay in New York. !!!!!!!!!!!!,Feb 19| 2019,2
Everything about the hotel’s location| service| cleanliness| etc.| would definitely bring me back. My only issues were the one-size-fits-all breakfast buffet and the very poor wi-fi connection.,Feb 19| 2019,4
Great service.  Very quiet.,Feb 5| 2019,5
Excellent hotel. It looks like new. Cleaned| no bad smells and great location. I’d love to come back,Feb 5| 2019,5
hotel needs some updating but staff is lovely,Feb 3| 2019,5
The staff was very friendly and the location was great. Loved the room.,Jan 7| 2019,5
Great location. Friendly staff. Early check in was not a problem at all. Rooms are large (by NY standards) and clean.,Jan 7| 2019,4
Good location with available street parking over the weekend.  Very close to the subway.  Room was nice but bedding had dirt on in when we arrived - like pet hair maybe   Bedding also did not stay on the bed.  Both nights I woke up cold and found the blankets on the floor - several times.  Very odd.,Jan 7| 2019,4
Very well located with a lot of places to eat around the area. Walking distance to Ground Cero. Hotel very clean and pleasant.,Jan 6| 2019,5
Great location!! Hotel staff very kind!! Stayed for 5 nights and no complains,Jan 5| 2019,5

The staff here is outstanding. ALL of them.  The restaurant/ bar is great and the location is convenient. Subway stop in front.,Dec 17| 2018,5
Was slightly early for check in but was able to get into room. Staff very friendly at both check in| during stay| and at checkout. Gym was nice with 3 treadmills and weights. Only problem during stay which made it a 4 was trash pick up BOTH mornings around 6-6:30am right outside our 2nd floor window.,Dec 17| 2018,4
Considering the price of the room for a night| some facilities need a refresh or better repairs. Door was difficult to open and close| rust in the bathtub fixtures. Staff were all wonderful hospitality professionals. Can't say enough good things about the staff.,Dec 13| 2018,4
Great location amazing staff friendly and helpful even after checkout they let us store our bags and when we came back soaking wet they gave us towels to help us dry off,Nov 29| 2018,4
Great hotel closest to the NY metro but parking is a big minus. We payed $80 for 24hours parking in neighborhood!,Nov 28| 2018,4
great place| wonderful location!I would love to stay there again!,Nov 27| 2018,5
Very nice... easy access to all of New York City attractions,Nov 19| 2018,5
The staff was very rude. Dirty and noisy hotel. Does not worth the price.,Nov 18| 2018,1
We have stayed here a few times a year for the past 9 years  We are treated very well by their excellent  and attentive staff. It is our home away from home.It is a very convenient  location| close to subways| great restaurants|  and shopping. The best part is it is a neighborhood  away from the crowds uptown| yet minutes away by subway.,Nov 10| 2018,5
Nice conveniently located hotel in great neighborhood,Nov 8| 2018,5
This hotel was the perfect location for our girls trip! The staff was so helpful and the room was a nice size for Manhattan. I felt extremely safe in the area| even returning back to the hotel late at night. Highly recommend Pepelino’s across the street. Can not recommend the AOA restaurant attached to this hotel though| terrible experience there.,Nov 7| 2018,5
Rooms super small but comfortable!!!!!,Nov 5| 2018,3
Wonderful location. It’s right on the subway line and surrounded by great restaurants but far enough away from the busy Times Square. Rooms are slightly outdated and there were a few stains on the carpet in the room but we didn’t stay in the room much so it was ok. One of our bed sheet smelled bad and we had it changed without any issues. Staff are very friendly and greeted us everyone we walked in or out. Would definitely stay here again!,Nov 5| 2018,4
Everything was excellent except that we couldn’t close the curtains to block the bright streetlights shining into the room every night.,Nov 2| 2018,4
Great location.  Rooms were adequately sized.  Breakfast was convenient and nicely done.,Oct 23| 2018,5
When we went to check in with a reservation| we were told they didnt have our king size bed with a city view room reservation that we paid extra for. when my husband said we want money back| all of a sudden they had not one room but 2. imagine that. WHY?,Oct 22| 2018,2
Good,Oct 20| 2018,4
Good location with decent room.  We usually stay here when we visit NYC| but the room we stayed in didn't seem as clean as what we are used to here.,Oct 17| 2018,4
Loved the location in NYC. Tribeca is in the heart of things| but not touristy.,Oct 11| 2018,5
Excelente,Oct 9| 2018,5
Clean| easy check in| staff was very helpful and patient.,Oct 9| 2018,5
Great location| very reasonable prices| helpful staff.  Was angry they moved me from my reservation| a non smoking King| into a "view" double" room.  The "view" rooms front 6th Ave and are unbearably noisy.  No sleep first night.  When I insisted they moved us to quiet room in rear we had reserved.,Oct 3| 2018,4
I liked the location because it was close to the places I wanted to visit.,Oct 1| 2018,4
Clean modern and good location for little italy and china town ...my 2nd time there !,Sep 19| 2018,5
The hotel need urgently a reform But very nice location,Sep 16| 2018,3

The discussion on parking and the cost of garbage timing of getting the car,Aug 31| 2018,2
Loved this hotel!   Friendly staff| great restaurant and clean & spacious rooms!  Fabulous area too!  Close to everything!,Aug 22| 2018,5
Decent hotel| close to restaurants| transportation| sights.,Aug 20| 2018,4
Not great ... room was not clean . Water problem in washroom,Aug 20| 2018,3
Perfect location for our event and nice room!,Aug 19| 2018,5
The room was on fifth floor with natural light & distance from street noise.  The in-room Air Conditioning was loud even on lowest setting.  We needed to turn off to get to sleep.   I mentioned it to the front desk the first evening but unaware if anything was done (mentioned at check out also).  Near subway & Tribeca/downtown neighborhoods.,Aug 14| 2018,4
Nice room| had construction going on early Saturday morning outside the window,Aug 9| 2018,4
It was very comfortable experience| the area is a fun and walkable to many places.,Aug 6| 2018,5
Nice hotel centrally located in TriBeCa. Close to the Brooklyn bridge| parks| music venues. Nice restaurant next door for dinner with outdoor dining. Also for breakfast| nice breakfast buffet. The subway station is literally across the street from the hotel,Aug 4| 2018,5
Nice hotel close to some good restaurants and shopping.....just off the 3rd floor. Good staff| quiet| clean good breakfast,Jul 31| 2018,5
Great location| friendly staff| good feel to this place,Jul 25| 2018,5
Overall a great stay for a weekend in Soho!,Jul 24| 2018,4
Great location in lower Manhattan. Great staff and clean rooms!,Jul 23| 2018,5
excellent location - close enough to get into Manhattan but far enough away that it was quieter. Good restaurants and Little Italy within walking distance.,Jul 23| 2018,5
Safe location.  Staff very accommodating.  Very clean and quiet.,Jul 22| 2018,4
Very good location,Jul 7| 2018,5
Close but not to close to all that action. Uptown and downtown attractions easily accessible. Subway access right outside hotel. Comfortable bed and pillows. Great restaurants and bars within walking distance,Jul 7| 2018,5
We had been traveling for over a week and stayed in other hotels along the way. After the last one| our room in Tribeca was amazingly clean| comfy and inviting!,Jul 5| 2018,5
Good hotel. Our room needed updating. Manager was arrogant and spoke down to his staff. Edwin| the valet was very polite| professional and nice. Cost of valet parking was more than advertised.,Jul 2| 2018,4
Walking distance to Chinatown and Italian down. Very convenient.,Jun 26| 2018,4
The people that work at this hotel are terrific.,Jun 24| 2018,5
Close to Subway and easy access to everything in that part of NYC.,Jun 15| 2018,5
This place was fantastic. Clean and the staff was incredible. Worth every penny. We moved to a different hotel during our stay and are paying more and get so much less. We will be back!,Jun 5| 2018,5
Great location.  Very close to subway.  Comfortable and decent accommodations.,Jun 1| 2018,4
Everyone I interacted with was welcoming| friendly| and efficient - receptionists| waiters| maids.  The room was very clean and comfortable with an excellent bed and pillows.  The only thing missing in the room was an alarm clock.  Tribeca was a wonderful location.  Also| there was a subway entrance next to the hotel| making getting around New York extremely easy.  I would definitely stay there again and will recommend it to friends.,May 27| 2018,5
Great location,May 26| 2018,4
Great trip| service and location. Just wish the windows had more insulation against outside noise. If you're a light sleeper or like to sleep in and have a street view on a lower floor the traffic and other noise outside will wake you. But otherwise highly recommended.,May 25| 2018,4
Great for a night in the city - location| ease of access| price| and overall condition of the property.,May 21| 2018,4
Very good price considering the location. I wish the fitness center were 24 hour. The breakfast at the restaurant was very overpriced.,May 19| 2018,4
Great service. Breakfast was awesome - well prepared with great service and was a great value. The A C & E trains were actually at the door. A very cool neighborhood in tribeca with many excellent and varied style and priced  reataurants less than a 5 minute walk away. A train stop or 2 or 30 minute walk away from both Chelsea and Wall Street/911 memorial.,May 16| 2018,5
Great location and nice facility. But| the safe was locked when we got there which was an inconvenience.,May 16| 2018,4
Our stay was nice. The room was clean and orderly. We have no complaints and love staying at hilton hotels.,May 15| 2018,5
the room smelled bad,May 14| 2018,2
It is a well located hotel| but nothing special beside that; old furniture and appliances. Breakfast is basic american type and a bit pricey (40 $ for two)| so I recommend to get one at canal street.Elevator can be sometimes quite slow| for a small building like this.,May 13| 2018,3
Too much noise. Room 211 directly opposite lift doors. People tend to talk causing disturbance all hrs of night and early mornings. Trash trucks woke us early morning 04H20 on the day we left for home. The fuel fumes of trash truck could be smelt in room as well.,May 9| 2018,3
Great location and the staff was very helpful. They let us check in early and after checkout we were able tiostore our bags until we came back later in the day.,May 8| 2018,5
Average hotel | the restaurant is awful!!! We have stayed at many other places in the city am will not be returning to this one ! It needs a serious update and to not use the room that is literally next to the HVAC :(,May 7| 2018,3
Air conditioning didn’t work They apologized and gave me points,May 4| 2018,4
Staff was very friendly. Good location for lower Manhattan vacation. I would certainly stay there again.,May 3| 2018,5
Rooms were fine| location is great.  Needs some updates in lobby and restaurant.  Furniture was worn and some chairs in restaurant were usable but broken.  Right by the subway.  Good restaurants nearby. Walkable to Wall Street| the Battery| and 911 memorial.,May 2| 2018,4
My bed was not that confortable. Would recommend adding 1 bottle of water per night and glasses to the room.,Apr 29| 2018,4
The woman that checked me in has got to be the most friendly hotel staff that I’ve encountered,Apr 28| 2018,5
Great area if you like the downtown area. Staff is very nice and informative. Beds are very comfortable!!!,Apr 24| 2018,4
Great location| friendly and helpful staff| clean and comfortable room. Very happy with my stay.,Apr 22| 2018,5
Garbage trucks at 6am on a Sat morning? Having lived three blocks away at one time| I know this is a violation of a noise ordinance. The noise woke my entire family and last for almost 45min!,Apr 22| 2018,3
It was off to a bad start when they assigned us a room with a king instead of 2 doubles like requested| and the keys didn't even work| so we had to go back to the desk to get a different room. The room itself was clean| though quite small compared to other hotel rooms. We left early the following morning for an all day conference| and when we returned at about 3:30 pm| the housekeeping hadn't shown up yet to clean. They finally knocked on our door after 4pm| but we were resting and didn't want to leave while they cleaned. We checked out the next day without ever having our room cleaned. There was some noise at night from the streets| but it wasn't too bothersome. The only other complaint was the cost of valet parking - $75 a day plus tax was ridiculously high! Otherwise| the hotel was nice| clean and a pleasant stay for New York City.,Apr 16| 2018,4
Great location| but there was a lot of construction going on around the hotel. Rooms need to be updated| and the mattresses were weird. You would sink in and it would create a hole. Rooms were cleaned after 4:00!,Apr 13| 2018,3
Very friendly staff| clean| roomy and perfect location for our girls weekend.,Apr 8| 2018,5
It was a great experience. Very friendly staff. Clean rooms. Would go there again. Wish it had free breakfast.,Mar 24| 2018,4
Nice hotel and a restaurant is attached.  Convenient to shopping and food| but not as many restaurants.  Tribeca is also not really a tourist area like midtown Manhattan| but then you can Uber there in about 20 minutes (although it's only about 2.5 miles away). I liked the location of this hotel and the price was very reasonable at about $135.  Be sure you get a room with a view.,Mar 21| 2018,5
GOOD LOCATION FOR THE DENIM SHOPS IN SOHO| HANDY BAR/RESTAURANT ATTACHED TO HOTEL AND I LOVELY JAPANESE RESTAURANT OPPOSITE HOTEL,Mar 20| 2018,4
Hotel is not great. Bed was very hard and uncomfortable. Road noise is crazy loud. Curtains aren't quite dark enough to keep the light out at night. Elevator was super slow - I took the stairs most of the time. Tried to call room service one time and they didn't answer for 30 minutes. I just wouldn't stay here if you are on a business trip. Maybe it's acceptable if you're a tourist and you just need somewhere to stay| but I would avoid.,Mar 16| 2018,3
Plenty of free on-street parking. Will definitely stay again.,Mar 9| 2018,4
Great location for this trip as we needed to spend time in lower Manhattan and the Times Square area. Subway lines were very convenient.,Mar 5| 2018,5
Liked everything about the hotel and the. location. Only complaint would be the 75 dollar parking fee per night with no options.,Mar 4| 2018,5
Very convenient location! Used E train at Canal Street station to go most places and walked to the rest.,Mar 3| 2018,5
Perfect location!  Literally right next to a major subway stop (A train).  It is a clean and quiet hotel but the heating was a bit odd...it was either super hot or super chilly| especially the bathroom in the morning.  The bed comfort was ok.  I would stay here again simply for the location and convenience of it.,Mar 1| 2018,5
You pay what you get. The location is good but the rest is for a Hilton brand very disappointing.The staff is arrogant and does not want to engage. The Ops Manager himself should attend a training in regard to friendliness and overall hospitality. Instead of finding solutions he blames Hilton for everything. What an Ambassador. Do not send a package there or have something delivered| they will charge you recklessly with the excuse it’s mentioned on the homepage or webpage. Well| it’s not mentioned on Expedia. I got in touch with Garden Inn service center and they promised to look into this matter. Guess what| nothing happened. They do not provide water in the room. Indont recommend to drink or use the tap water over there. Instead they are forcing you to go down and get from the self service fridge a 6$ water bottle. Really? The cost of 1 bottle is most likely less than 1$ and they are charging 6$. This is very off. The room is clean but there is a certain smell. The mattress had hard pumps.Not to recommend. Pay a few bucks more somewhere else and have a good sleep and most likely better service.Sorry Hilton| this is a no go.,Feb 22| 2018,2
Super convenient ;; super staff,Feb 20| 2018,5
The accommodations were good but could have been better.  The service was excellent,Feb 19| 2018,4
the most uncomfortable mattress ever. couldnt get a good nights sleep. woke up with back pain.good location. front desk staff was friendly.,Feb 19| 2018,3
Overall good hotel without the frills with subway right outside.,Feb 19| 2018,4
Great experience| hotel staff| proximity to subway and great restaurants added a nice luxury.,Feb 12| 2018,5
The hotel was excellent! I would definitely stay there again. The location was central to a lot of the places we visited. The subway being so close was also a huge benefit. We were allowed early check in| and found our room to be clean and comfy.  Unfortunately AOA the restaurant that is attached failed to meet my expectations.,Feb 10| 2018,5
Really great location| plenty of interesting eating and drinking sites| nice botique feeling & friendly staff,Feb 5| 2018,4
Comfortable hotel probably ready for refurb| in good area with great views from front rooms. Subway entrance 10 metres from front door. Had pleasant stay,Jan 25| 2018,3
Super easy to get the subway,Jan 23| 2018,4
I came for business and stayed two days. The room and amenities were excellent. The cost is reasonable| the staff exceptional. The beds were comfortable| the room clean and warm in these winter months. I enjoyed the in room coffee maker and the microwave and fridge. One of the best elements aside from the bed and the wonderful view was the bath tub which was ample and the water hot hot hot. I will come back again and highly recommend.,Jan 23| 2018,5
Great service. Convenient location. Wonderful staff. No hassle sign in.,Jan 21| 2018,5
The staff was great. The place was sooo clean. My only negative is that my bed was warped. But overall great experience!!!,Jan 16| 2018,5
We had a nice stay at the Hilton Garden.  The room was larger than I expected for Manhattan.  The hotel bar is great (good food| strong beer list).  The bed in our room may have been the worst mattress I ever slept on| the toilet ran constantly| and basic re-stockings (coffee| towels| shampoo) were frequently overlooked by housekeeping.  But the room and facilities were clean| check in was easy| the the area is safe.,Jan 16| 2018,4
For a weekend going around NYC you can’t beat the location. The subway is 20 steps from the front door and World Trade Center area is a 10 minute walk,Jan 8| 2018,4
It's an easy NYC stay in downtown. Right by the subway. Decent sized rooms and restaurant on site.,Jan 5| 2018,4
My daughter and I couldn't be more pleased with our stay at Hilton Gardens Inn Tribeca! Marcus at the front desk was an amazing resource about local| high quality restaurants and attractions.  His genuine warmth and attention to detail made our stay delightful!  Housekeeping was very understanding when we took a little extra time to collect all of our new purchases and check out.  I highly recommend HGI Tribeca for everyone - young| old or in between!,Jan 5| 2018,5
Hotel is right at a subway line A|C|E tracks which was good as very cold outside. Room with 2 twins for 4 people and luggage is a little tight and cramped. Bathroom is small too also. But its New York and real estate is at a premium.,Dec 31| 2017,4
We love it here. Love the staff| kid friendly--our three year old loved running around the hotel.,Dec 30| 2017,5
For our 1st time to NYC| we couldn't have asked for more! Clean comfortable rooms walking distance to so much and helpful polite staff!,Dec 26| 2017,5
The room was great | clean | roomy . The bed itself was awful. It was that memory foam stuff and I sunk right in. It just my personal preference for a firm mattress. Housekeeping was great very friendly. Front desk personnel all had an attitude| as if they couldn't believe people were asking them questions and bothering them.  I asked if they had laundry facilities and was told no they don't provide any laundry services which I could have sworn they Sid when booking the room. I went back up to my room to look at the website and they do provide a dryclean service.!  I went back down and confronted the man and he seemed extremely annoyed and said "you asked for a laundry facility not a service" I said either way you knew what I was asking for you could have just told me.  At least the African American concierge guy was super friendly and helpful! He was the best person there. The hotel is is very clean and in great condition. It's location is awesome  near the subway|coffee| little Italy|China town shopping I loved the location. The AOA restaurant connected to the hotel.. YUCK YUCK YUCK.food is overpriced and gross. Staff is just as rude.They serve breakfast |basically reheated frozen stuff &want $17.00 per person for breakfast. Save your $ go to the Square Diner down the street. Its amazing and made from scratch . Despite the rude service and bad food the hotel itself is great! Just needs a clean sweep of the staff.,Dec 24| 2017,4
The bar was nice and the customer service was great. The elevators have air fresheners stuck up in the ceiling and the scents are overpowering and not pleasant. The breakfast is expensive even though they offer the same stuff as free breakfasts at other hotel chains.,Dec 23| 2017,4
Hotel is very convenient if riding the NY subway. Also walking distance to Soho| Chinatown| 911 memorial. I like it that they have a fitness center. Rooms and facilities are really nice.,Dec 22| 2017,4
The hotel was new| clean and comfortable. The room was larger than I expect in NY.  Service was excellent.,Dec 19| 2017,5
Mediocre at best,Dec 16| 2017,3
It is in a good location for me as my daughter lives nearby.     The mattresses are in poor condition and the rooms need updating.    |,Dec 13| 2017,4
Plain| tired room| door knob fell off so it took me several minutes and grease-stained hands to get out of the room (though very promptly repaired| dirty lobby washrooms shared with the next-door restaurant| and taxis booked by concierge considerably more cost than calling on your own and using the meter.  That being said| the location is ideal--Canal St subway right outside the entrance| close to everything in Tribeca & Soho| and the staff were very helpful.  Coffee and refreshments in lobby a nice touch; fitness room solid.,Dec 11| 2017,3
Hotel was very good. Great service| clean. Room was small and hotel VERY hard to find-not well marked. However| staff was very kind and stayed on the phone to "bring us in." Edwin "Teddy Bear" was this very person!,Dec 4| 2017,5
Very clean| comfortable bed| would stay here again,Dec 4| 2017,5
Modern hotel with good accommodations. Nice location on the edge of SoHo and subway station right outside the hotel gets you on the A train to and from JFK Airport. Have used this hotel several times because of link to airport and proximity to many sights and destinations (e.g. restaurants| shopping| parks).,Nov 27| 2017,4
The hotel staff at this hotel are amazing!!They are super helpful and go the extra mile to ensure you have a good stay!The rooms and hotel are very clean| although the bed was a bit soft for me.I like staying here as it is in a convenient location| close to Soho and a subway stop right outside your door!,Nov 20| 2017,4
We had such a great time at this hotel. The staff was super friendly and very accommodating. They kept our bags after we checked out and our car for an extra day free of charge. Would definitely stay here again and recommend it to everyone! We will be back.,Nov 12| 2017,5
What a gem!  I liked the modern lobby and rooms...and the internet was free| high speed and available.  Nice bedding and black out curtains contributed to a great sleep.  The adjoining restaurant has good food - highly recommend the French toast.  It came covered in fresh fruit!  The staff were really helpful - especially Mr Santos.  They arranged a ride back to the airport for a very reasonable flat rate| in a Lincoln Navigator.  We felt well treated.  Will stay here again.,Oct 18| 2017,5
Great room sizes| especially for NY City. The staff was friendly overall| but nothing spectacular. However| for NYC| they were really friendly.,Oct 15| 2017,4
Our stay was perfect from beginning to end the room was very nice and the staff beyond wonderful.  We will definitely be staying again .,Oct 9| 2017,5
Worst customer service I’ve ever seen. They steal.,Oct 4| 2017,1
The staff was always friendly and looking to help with any convenience.  Great location to food and trains. Overall| rating a 4 as the attached AoA Grill was less than average service.  Especially| compared to the desk staff.,Oct 2| 2017,4
The two gentlemen who work the night shift Saturday were rude as to the point they never acknowledge me one time. Other then that I had a great stay.,Sep 26| 2017,4
The bed was a bit uncomfortable but the excellent service from the people at the desk and the cleaning staff more than made up for it. The room was spotlessly clean and in a lovely area.,Sep 7| 2017,4
parking sucks....,Sep 6| 2017,4
Good access to all areas of manhattan walking distance to soho and ground zero. Three subway lines outside the hotel took us to times sq| the baseball and the tennis. Would definitely stay again!,Sep 4| 2017,5
Staff was friendly and helpful. Room was clean. Wifi in the room. Great location next to a subway stop and walking distance to a bagel shop/deli with excellent food. We had an outstanding trip,Aug 30| 2017,4
Pleasant stay,Aug 28| 2017,5
The hotel was really nice and really clean. My only compliant was that they had recently stained the wood in the elevator and they didn't have a sign displayed and therefore I ended up with stain all over my hands.,Aug 24| 2017,5
Great location!  Easy to get to other points of interest. Also Feds comfortable.,Aug 23| 2017,4
the Hilton is ideally located| a short walk to Chinatown and Little Italy and the 911 memorial. It is a short cab ride to Katz`s and even taking the subway to Coney Islandis easy. The hotel staff is great| especially Kevin. The room was a little tight for two people| but was well equipped| coffee maker| fridge and micro,Aug 22| 2017,4
Subway is right in front of the hotel (Canal St. Station). Restaurants and shopping are within walking distance. Our room was clean and good size for NYC.,Aug 22| 2017,5
The hotel staff did a wonderful job ensuring that we had a room on an upper level floor (to minimize road noise| mainly honking cars) and that we could check in a little earlier than regular times so we could drop our items off in our room and get ready for a wedding. We did use their valet parking and they had our car ready for us when we requested it. I very much appreciated the Keurig coffee maker in the room!,Aug 17| 2017,5
We were on a low floor just over the street and could watch the nightlife and still see the stars. There were sheer curtains that gave us privacy while still allowing us to see the city. There was no noise| because we had the a/c on. We had a great time| this was a perfect spot to start the day - subway right outside the door. Beds were comfortable and plush with nice bedspreads.,Aug 16| 2017,5
Close to the subway| but they could never get us the right number and type of towels.  Had to call for more every day.  One day cleaning staff came in a ion st 8:30 AM while we were there (they did not knock).  Finally| beds very uncomfortable.,Aug 1| 2017,3
Had a great stay. Nice hotel and lovely staff.,Jul 29| 2017,5
The hotel was fine| and the people were nice| however| there were no ny subway maps| and no other guides of NY.  All we got was one little map.  Also| when I asked for blankets| it took an hour and I was already asleep when they arrived.,Jul 23| 2017,4
Great location with great restaurants around. Very walkable to many visiting spots. The staff was friendly and efficient. The restaurant in the hotel was pretty good too.,Jul 22| 2017,4
The hotel's location is great to catch the subway. The entrance is right outside the hotel. The staff is very friendly.  The rooms are small but the beds are comfortable.  The restaurant has a good selection of food.  There is a convience store across the street. So we were able to get beverages and fresh fruit at the store.  There is a Dunkin Donuts down the street.  And Chinatown and Little Italy is in walking distance.  You can't go wrong with the hotel.,Jul 19| 2017,5
Location of the hotel is perfect - directly next to the Canal St transit station in lower Manhattan. Literally can walk out the front door and down into the Subway. Short train ride to WTC/Battery Park| Times Square| and all other attractions in central Manhattan. Walking distance to Chinatown and Little Italy. If you drive here| be aware that parking is scarce. Nearby lots and the hotel valet are both expensive. The bus lane out front of the hotel opens up to street parking on the weekends| so we got lucky and found a spot there. The staff was friendly| helpful| and professional. Rooms were small| but nice. Bed/mattress was very lumpy and uncomfortable....my back hurt every morning when I woke up. There is a restaurant and bar attached to the lobby which was convenient. Free coffee in the morning; free citrus ice water and cookies in the afternoon/evenings. Aside from the terrible bed| it was a good stay overall. I would stay here again.,Jul 19| 2017,4
It was a very clean and pleasant hotel. The staff could not be more friendly and courteous and helpful. Would stay there again,Jul 18| 2017,5
Located at Tribeca| Easy to go the NYC attractions| very clean room and kind staffs although the facility is little bit old.,Jul 17| 2017,4
We were happy with our stay here.  I would definitely consider staying in Tribeca again given ease of access to downtown| the Village| the Lower East Side and mid-town.  If you are willing to walk 5-10 blocks you don't even have to take cabs to get to some great restaurants.  Avoid the crowds of Times Square and other more obvious places to stay.,Jul 16| 2017,4
Very clean and cozy. I have stayed in several hotels in NYC and this hotel is certainly one of the best price to quality ratio.,Jul 11| 2017,5
Fantastic hotel with large rooms for New York located next to a subway station only criticism is the roadworks going on when I stayed for a week,Jul 10| 2017,5
Housekeeping and front desk staff were awesome.  Esperenza and Mark,Jul 7| 2017,5
Enjoyed my trip. Stayed with my dad. The rooms were spacious | clean and affordable. Hotel is close to Canal St subway. Leave you car at home! Took the train to see the 4th of July fireworks. No travel stress. Near Wall St.,Jul 7| 2017,5
Excellent location.  Quiet area.,Jul 6| 2017,5
We enjoyed our 10 night stay.Perfect location for seeing New York with a main metro line 1 minute walk from front door and others within 5 minutes which means you can get anywhere with ease and no long walks back from your hotel after a day of sight seeing.Great cafes and restaurants in every direction or a restaurant/bar attached to Hotel that was very popular.Walking distance to Soho| Little Italy and China town.  We walked via Soho| Greenwich village and midtown to Central Park which was a great way to see the different areas.We had a very clean room with 2 comfortable double beds with no view but it was relatively quiet and we were really only there to sleep - NY keeps you out all day and night!We loved having a fridge in our room.I had read about how small NY hotel rooms were but this was quite spacious with a good sized wardrobe and a desk.There was an ice vending machine on the floor for guests use which was great to have in the hot weather.Bathroom with shower over bath but quite spacious and plenty of bench space and very clean,Jul 6| 2017,4
I would stay here again.  The staff was superb| the location was great.  Rooms a little small| but hey| it's NYC.,Jul 5| 2017,5
Great spot| fun neighborhood. Subway stop just outside the front door. Would stay here again,Jul 2| 2017,5
Great location| so close to all the downtown and south side attractions in the West and East Villages| the FiDi| WTC| SoHo| Little Italy and just right out the door access to the Subway. Being on 6th/Avenue of the America's and York| you're just a straight shot up the Avenue to Midtown and Central Park. Very Convenient.,Jun 27| 2017,5
The front desk staff was friendly. My only two complaints would be the bathroom had a very strong odor of urine like it hadn't been disinfected in a long time. And the carpet in room 213 had two strange stains over by the desk. But the rest of the room seemed fine. The location was good it was a nice neighborhood| right next to a subway stop. And not too far from World Trade Center| Staute of Liberty area| Chinatown| Little Italy etc.. I love NYC so if you'r like me & enjoy the city vibe you will love staying at this hotel. Free coffee & a mini fridge & microwave. Free wifi was a bit slow but it is free so what do you expect. Also it seems to be across the street from a police precinct so always police round for security if that kind of thing makes you feel better.,Jun 25| 2017,4
Our stay was very comfortable. The restaurant has excellent food and we were within walking distance to many attractions. Our room was spacious and clean and the front desk staff was very courteous and helpful.,Jun 21| 2017,5
Good hotel in a great location right next to subway. Friendly & helpful staff and quick checkin. Room was big and had everything we needed. It was clean and bed comfy| probably needs a refurb soon though (nothing bad just things starting to get tatty)Would definitely stay there again.,Jun 11| 2017,4
Clean comfortable and close to my event parking was surprisingly reasonable for NYC,Jun 9| 2017,5
This was an ideal base for a great holiday. Hotel rooms were big with all amenities. Good breakfasts available plus free coffee on the go. Location was excellent| easy walking distance to Hudson River| Little Italy| World Trade Centre and a huge choice of restaurants. Highly recommended.,Jun 6| 2017,4
Wonderful hotel  in Tribeca.  The staff were welcoming and helpful|  and allowed us to check in at 2 PM after a long morning of travel.  The rooms were clean and quiet|  and spacious by New York standards.  I would definitely stay here again and and highly recommend this hotel.,Jun 6| 2017,5
Great place to stay.  Friendly| helpful staff| clean room| and close to the subway.  Would stay there again.,Jun 5| 2017,5
This trip ends up a 2 stars experience although it has great potential to be 5.1. Hotel does not on honor the advertised information. For our case| there is an extra sofa bed for a 3rd person. However| there is in fact a king bed for the 3 of us! It is very clean| modern and bed is near new. You can imagine how painful it is| especially that we have given up Hilton Garden inn midtown and others.Go to other Hilton Garden Inn in Manhattan if you can!,Jun 4| 2017,2
It was fine.  But the building inside is not attractive.No black out curtains in window so hard to sleep.  Sun comes in early.    Air conditioner/ fan loud.  And temp difficult to balance.  Bathroom door oddly heavy and in way of room door.,Jun 4| 2017,3
Wonderful!  Great stay in NYC.  Quiet.  Clean. Comfortable. Excellent staff.,Jun 2| 2017,5
The hotel is located in a very nice place| close to Broadway Street where you can shop and restaurants. Although if it is your first time in NYC i would not recommend it because it is kind of far away of the main attractions. Room service food is good and the staff is very nice. The hotel is not very modern but is very comfortable.,May 31| 2017,4
We arrived at the hotel at 1pm| and even though we were 2 hours early we were able to check in to our room. Big plus right there! Staff was very friendly & helpful. Hotel bar was very nice. Room was good| but the drawers wouldn't stay shut! A minor inconvenience. Only complaint was the price of valet car parking| $60 for 24 hours!! Other then that it was a wonderful stay.,May 29| 2017,5
Great location in Tribeca. Easy walk to a lot of places for tourists| restaurants.,May 29| 2017,5
A nice hotel in a safe section of New York. The staff is very friendly and helpful| and the rooms are kept well.,May 29| 2017,4
I stayed at this beautiful hotel for four days and I was thoroughly impressed by not only the staff| but also the rooms themselves. I will definitely be staying at this hotel again in the near future. Thank you for making my stay amazing!,May 23| 2017,5
Nice hotel. Very friendly people. Take good care of you!,May 20| 2017,5
Very nice and convenient| rooms a little dated but clean and comfortable. Would not hesitate to stay there again,May 16| 2017,4
The room stank like a whole bottle of Febreze had been sprayed in it before I arrived| and I couldn't air it out even with the window wide open.  The doors are also paper-thin| so you can hear every time someone opens their room door| and everything that's said in the hallways - that was a big noise issue for me.  The ice machine in the hallway was also incredibly loud and made my room shake.  The desk is also teeny-tiny| which made working a bit cramped.  Everything was clean and well-maintained| though.,May 13| 2017,3
We only stayed one night| but it was great. The location was perfect| the hotel bar was really fun and the service at the front desk was great. The room was very small| but it is NY.  Would definitely stay again.,May 1| 2017,5
Good location|  comfortable room. Staff was very helpful.,Apr 19| 2017,4
Messed up my room but nice quiet and clean hotel,Apr 14| 2017,4
Great location for restaurants| things to do and best of all| the subway. Staff was friendly and the room was comfortable and clean. Awesome value for NYC!,Apr 5| 2017,5
Most comfortable bed and sheets I've experienced in a while in a medium priced room.,Apr 2| 2017,5
Everything was great except on Satruday night |the guests next door were having  a very loud altercation. They finally settled down after 11:30. We were just about to alert the front desk| but it calmed down.,Apr 1| 2017,4
Great hotel for the price. Terrific location,Mar 26| 2017,5
Great staff Joe and German friendly and full of recommendations for local places to eat and visit. Our tv didn't work | we reported it fixed promptly| only needed it to keep track of March Madness| coffe in lobby GREAT| should he kept out longer|,Mar 22| 2017,4
Right when I checked in| I realized I had left my laptop on the plane at JFK.  The front desk staff immediately arranged for a car service to take me back to the airport and wait for me while I retrieved my computer| and then drive me back to the hotel.  Friendly staff| comfortable beds| decent sized rooms| good wifi connection and a location really close to Soho and the subway make this hotel a great value and a perfect choice when visiting the city.,Mar 22| 2017,5
Hotel was convenient| staff was excellent and over all experience was amazing!!!,Mar 14| 2017,5
15 minutes by subway to anywhere in the city.  More neighborhood feel than the craziness of Time Square and other parts of the city.  Subway station steps from the entrance.,Mar 7| 2017,4
When we arrived at first the man who was behind the counter was very friendly| polite and we joked around and laughed. He was incredibly helpful. We had boxes shipped there and the person who got them for us was also very helpful and nice. Our stay at the hotel was a big pleasure and we definitely will go back next year and enjoy it again. Overall an awesome experience. There is also a restaurant and bar at the hotel and the food was nice and all employees were extremely friendly. One of the friendliest hotels I have been in NYC! ♥,Mar 6| 2017,5
Staff very friendly and helpful. Well maintained hotel.  Room adequate size but definitely not spacious.  Not atypical for NYC. Would design stay again.  Great location.,Mar 4| 2017,4
This hotel was quite nice for the price| and had a decent buffet breakfast. Room service was good| and the 24 hour snack bar was a plus. Nice| if basic| gym.,Feb 27| 2017,4
great view nice room,Feb 20| 2017,4
Staff were very helpful when we asked for recommendations of local places to eat.We were able to leave our bags after we'd checked out while we went out for the day as our flight was in the evening.,Feb 19| 2017,4
Beautiful room and such a nice space. Initially| I was concerned as the room is right next to the elevator but we did not hear a thing. The Hilton is our go to hotel when we stay in the SoHo area. The only thing I don't like about this hotel is the hair dryer. It is attached to the wall. The location is fantastic being close to the Subway exit and all of the shops and restaurants in SoHo.,Feb 19| 2017,5
Nice hotel in a great location.,Feb 19| 2017,5
Edwin was a fantastic concierge,Feb 7| 2017,5
Very CLEAN! If your looking for a place to stay nothing fancy this is your place,Feb 7| 2017,4
The bed I slept on was not that great| I sank into a big hole.,Jan 30| 2017,5
The location is very central to very many attractions. The staff went above and beyond to accommodate our experience. The gave us an early check-in and put out hot chocolate instead of coffee for our little ones. They were very personal and remembered our names. If you have noisy neighbors you will be able to hear them but that only happened one of the 4 nights we were there and we were so tired from all the things we got to do that day we fell right asleep. For the price| excellent experience.,Jan 30| 2017,5
Great location with subway station right outside the door. Staff was very friendly and helpful| especially the concierge. Although once we tried to get room service and they never answered the phone (but I think that was actually the restaurant downstairs). Room was comfortable but it could have used a new shower head| or better pressure. The "pantry" downstairs had basic snacks but not as extensive as some I've seen| and no beer or wine (but bar/restaurant in the building). Overall happy with our stay| a great affordable option.,Jan 24| 2017,4
Great value for the location| and an amazing staff that always accommodates guest needs.,Jan 22| 2017,5
For the price we paid was great!,Jan 15| 2017,5
Nice hotel for the price. The girl working the front desk during the graveyard shift was rude but everyone else there was very pleasant and accommodating.,Jan 12| 2017,5
Lesson learned. If you book a room with jacuzzi| CALL IN ADVANCE TO MAKE SURE THEY CLEAN IT THOROUGHLY! Almost everything great| except I paid extra for a room with whirlpool bath| and the jets were full of dirt| dead skin| hair| debris. You would think| that specific room-type| the management would ensure the highlight of the room is spectacularly spotless. Informed them and they said call in advance next time to have maintenance clean it. What?! Huge disappointment for the extra expense.,Jan 12| 2017,4
Staff couldn't have been nicer at the front desk.  Room was small but bed was super comfy.  Has a great restaurant and bar although the bartenders aren't the most attentive.,Jan 11| 2017,4
Very relaxing,Jan 10| 2017,4
The staff was friendly and the location was great. Close to subway station and short walk to several places in the downtown area.,Jan 9| 2017,4
It was an easy check in and check out process. It was centrally located to a lot of great activities.,Jan 8| 2017,5
We stayed here New Year’s Eve. Very happy with our room.When we arrived the room was neat| tidy| and the décor/furniture was up-to-date. We stayed on the fourth floor| so there wasn't too much of a view.  We mostly traveled by Uber and subway to get to the attractions| not too far. We were also able to see the ball drop in time after arriving in the evening. We got back at about 6 in the morning and the staff took one look at us after requesting a late check out and allowed us another complimentary hour to accommodate our needs. They were super friendly and willing to hold our bags before we checked out. Bed was a bit firm but that's a preference thing….and we passed on the $16.95 breakfast per person. There are heaps of delicious food spots to hit up in NY!Would definitely stay again.,Jan 4| 2017,4
This was a nice hotel| and pleasant experience.  The only negative was our room was noisy.  The heat/air unit was loud| and we heard the conversation of any person walking in the hall.,Dec 31| 2016,4
it was really bad| we pay for a suite| but they just put 2 beds in a room and charge much more.,Dec 30| 2016,1
Overall good. We have stayed here before| so this was a deliberate choice and based on room size. All staff were friendly and obliging. Some details need attention. Over the holiday period the house keeping staff appeared really pushed. Restocking the beverages seemed a fairly random process| but this is nothing in the scale of things. More important was that the rest rooms in the reception area shared with the AOA restaurant were in a poor condition - not a good impression to create.,Dec 29| 2016,4
Great location| right above a subway that brought you into and out of uptown and all the major areas. 10/10 will stay here again when we come back| can't recommend it enough.,Dec 28| 2016,5
This is a very clean| neat Hilton brand hotel located in lower Manhattan area. Service could be further improved. Pros: Comfortable bed| the firmness of the mattress is about right - not too hard and not too soft. Room is spacious compared to some other chain hotels in Manhattan area. Location is tourism-friendly| several subway stops are around. Cons: They seem do not provide free toothbrush and toothpaste for travelers who forgot to bring their own. No free bottle water in room.,Dec 27| 2016,5
Great location| really clean rooms. Guy in the lobby was awesome with us on the last day sorting our luggage. Guy on the desk when we arrived was short and of little help which was a shame. Only major downer was the heater and fridge in the room sounded like jet engines. Had to have them off overnight which wasn't ideal with the cold temperature.,Dec 24| 2016,3
Great staff. Comfortable clean room. Couldn't fault it.,Dec 23| 2016,4
No on site washer and dryer.  Laundry pickup service that was not available on weekends.  Great hotel other than that.  Extremely close to 3 different subway lines which makes traveling as easy as possible.  Will stay again.,Dec 20| 2016,5
We received a first-class service from Mark who is at the reception desk at check-in. Kind courteous patient helpful great attitude.,Dec 16| 2016,5
Stayed two nights on business trip. Hotel was convenient for SoHo and the client's office. Lobby is bright but my room was smallish and a bit dated. Don't really understand the 'two double bed' set-up in the US. Also hotel was quite pricey for a mid-range,Dec 11| 2016,3
Nyc gotta love it what else can I satNice ppl and area,Dec 9| 2016,4
Good location walking distance to the heart of Tribeca and Little Italy. Right on the subway station| so very easy to get anywhere.,Dec 3| 2016,5
I was greeted by the most pleasant and helpful front desk staff that I have met in a very long time ! They could not have been more welcoming ! My only negative comment is about the bedding| the bed was rock hard.,Nov 29| 2016,4
The hotel was nice and location was great for our stay. The subway entrance was right outside the hotel which was great. Staff at front desk were wonderful and very helpful. One problem we did have was that our room was not restocked daily with coffee or these items. Overall I would recommend this hotel for a stay.,Nov 28| 2016,4
Great hotel and staff was very friendly Clean rooms great service,Nov 28| 2016,5
Great time seeing the sites of NYC. Great restraunts walking distance. Chelsea market great.,Nov 25| 2016,5
I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this hotel.  The front desk workers were friendly and genuinely concerned.  I loved my spacious and clean room.  The bed was very comfortable.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.  I loved how close it was to Soho| Chinatown| and Little Italy.  Highly recommended!,Nov 24| 2016,5
The location was great-our daughter lives nearby. Canal St. station 1-2-3 very close by.. Staff was awesome.  Not luxury| but very clean and convenient.  We will stay again!,Nov 19| 2016,4
We thought the hotel was just okay. But the staff was really nice and very accommodating. When we announced that it was our anniversary| they comped us a bottle of wine.,Nov 17| 2016,4
Hotel was in a nice neighborhood| close to the subway| and reasonably priced. Rooms were generic without any special amenities. We were dissatisfied because our rooms were not cleaned by housekeeping| but there was no offer of compensation for the inconvenience. They do not offer express/quick check-out options| so it was a bit of a wait to try to check-out in the morning.,Nov 5| 2016,3
Old property with outdated amenities (old| awkwardly working phones and old| poorly working irons and in-room safes).,Nov 3| 2016,3
Loved the attached restaurant. Good food and gluten-free options.,Oct 18| 2016,4
Good| clean hotel.  Great location too.  Try the Italian restaurant right across the street.  It's fabulous!,Oct 13| 2016,5
I was disappointed with the place considering how expensive it was. Overall the room was nice but I came across towels in the room that were not clean at all. Had black stains all over the towels and others with holes and more stains. I was shocked. Having said that service was great and the employees were wonderful.,Oct 10| 2016,1
Easy to walk to great shops and restaraunts. Cool area. Friendly front desk staff and a big help with parking.  Enjoyable stay,Oct 2| 2016,4
Very nice place to stay in Lower Manhattan. Easy access to restaurants| shops and sights. Walking distance to park on Hudson River.,Sep 27| 2016,4
Mattresses old and worn out. Refrigerator not working. Did issue some credit but don't know how much. Disappointed for $1800 for only 3 nights.,Sep 24| 2016,3
Nice place| fairly friendly front desk staff. Ok area| noisy if you stay on the lower floors. The building looks a little tired but ok. No free water and price is extortionate.,Sep 23| 2016,3
Good location| clean and friendly staff. Stay there often and have always enjoyed the experience.,Sep 18| 2016,4
The room was ok. The location was great. The staff was ok.,Sep 15| 2016,3
Exterior architecture is rather interesting. Nice resturant. "City views" are not worth the extra $50. The room decor are pretty uninspiring. I considering I could have stayed at the roxy or a nicer hotel for about the same price.,Sep 13| 2016,3
Good location in The lower west side. Would stay there again.,Sep 12| 2016,4
Check in was quick| and the receptionist even went out of her way to help us with finding street parking| which we did!  Location is right inside the Holland tunnel| and walking distance to a ton of great restaurants and shopping within SoHo.  Hotel is also right next to the subway as well.  Will definitely be staying here again.,Sep 9| 2016,5
Family vacation. The hotel was very conveniently located. Staff was friendly and the room was clean and comfortable.,Sep 9| 2016,5
This hotel is in a fantastic location which allowed us to easily explore Chinatown| Little Italy| Greenwich etc but with a subway stop right outside the front door we were also easily able to visit Central Park| Times Square etc in a short 15 min ride.The hotel staff were all excellent. Friendly and helpful to a fault. The only downside was how expensive the attached bar/restaurant was but those kind of prices are not unusual in New York where everything seemed incredibly expensive compared to other places we have visited in the States. I would very much recommend this hotel to those who wanted to see more of New York beyond the neon and tourist gift shops. We will certainly be back should we ever visit New York again,Sep 7| 2016,4
We came to see a show in the lower east village and this was a very nice room| restaurant and location. short walk to the subway and a car was very easy to get too.Nice room and Bath.,Sep 1| 2016,5
Passed the hotel a couple times because there is not a very big sign that says "Hilton". Our stay was nice. The staff was accomodating| we received the early check in we requested (check in was at 3| we were able to get a room before noon)| and they even put our friends in the room directly across from ours. We ordered food from the restaurant which was good. The shower was EXCELLENT| and the valet was very professional. Overall it was a nice one night stay.,Aug 21| 2016,4
Real friendly staff.,Aug 18| 2016,4
The best part of an overall great experience was the staff....who were remarkably friendly| helpful and kind from front desk to housekeeping and back again.  We were greeted in a pleasant way by EVERY employee we encountered| even the maintenance guy who happened to be in the hall when we stepped off the elevator.,Aug 17| 2016,5
Great location.  Super-friendly and helpful front desk.,Aug 15| 2016,5
I hate to give the hotel a great review because I want to make sure there will be rooms available for my next trip to NYC!We've stayed in the Financial District| Hell's Kitchen| Midtown - but nothing compares to Tribeca. Within an easy block walk to the subway| visitors have access to the entire city. The area is safe and walkable| with a plethora of easy activities in the Village| East Village| SoHo| Little Italy| and Chinatown.Hotel amenities are limited but adequate. This is not a location to stay in anyway. Highly recommended.,Aug 9| 2016,5
We loved the hotel. We stayed for 3 nights.  The only thing we didn't like was how firm the beds were but everything else was great.,Aug 9| 2016,5
Everything was great about our stay except the pillows were terrible. They were extremely flat and I have a sensitive neck. I had a terrible sleep and haven't been able to move my neck in 2 days. I even requested better pillows but they were just as flat.,Aug 8| 2016,4
Only stayed on night with our teenage grand-daughters.  Plenty of room for four in the room.,Aug 8| 2016,4
Joe| Vinny| Edwin.....what a team. They truly give your company 110 percent.,Jul 31| 2016,5
This Hotel is not necessarily in the middle of everything but it is so easy to get a cab or take the subway. It was comfortable and staff was so kind. As a young woman traveling alone| I felt safe at all times. I suggest this hotel for any woman or solo travelers.,Jul 29| 2016,5
Really nice little hotel in TriBeCa. Close to family which is why we stayed there. Staff was super friendly and helpful. The only downside was the buffet breakfast offered at $16 per person in restaurant attached to lobby was not very good. You are much better off finding another place for breakfast.,Jul 22| 2016,5
Just okay. For the price that we got on Hotels| it was good. Quite clean| in a great location near Soho and downtown.,Aug 16| 2021,4
Pas mal et bien placé. Chambres un peu vieillottes,Jul 12| 2021,4

L'emplacement de l'établissement est idéal pour visiter plusieurs quartiers intéressants de Manhattan!,Mar 11| 2020,5
Convenient location| good prices and reasonably sized rooms for Manhattan make this a very good choice in terms of cost/benefit.However| our stay was marred by very poor housekeeping (among other things| we had to ask twice| on two separate occasions| to have the room's trash bins emptied - were it not for Mr. Julius| on the night staff| who immediately took matters into his own hands| we'd still be waiting...)A formal complaint to the front desk about this| and the general sub-par cleaning| went nowhere.,Feb 23| 2020,4
チェックインの際に対応してくれた若い女性のスタッフがとても親切で感じが良かった。チェックイン以外の時もとても気遣ってくれて、困ったことがないかと常に聞いてくれた。,Jan 27| 2020,4
Gute Lage. Direkt an der Metro| Tribeca und Canalstreet sind ein super Ausgangspunkt.,Jan 7| 2020,4
It’s very nice we like the room and the position the only problem was at night the people was working I’m assuming and it was very noise . The Canal st metro stop it’s right in front of the hotel . I will recommend this hotel,Dec 27| 2019,4
Good location. Very practical. Large rooms. Very friendly staff,Dec 27| 2019,5
Great location and it had everythign we needed for out stay.,Dec 25| 2019,5
地下鉄の駅にも近く、部屋は十分な広さがあり清潔でした。朝にフロント横に無料のコーヒーサービスがあり、助かりました。連泊したのですが、毎日カードキーを更新してもらわないといけない（クレジットカードのデポジットも）のは面倒だなと感じました。,Dec 22| 2019,5
エレベーターはのんびりタイプでだったが、午前中にフロントの横にコーヒーとお茶のサービスが有るので便利。　お部屋には壁付けのドライヤーと普通のドライヤーが有った。　電子レンジが有るが、紙コップしかないので、お湯を沸かす時は紙コップでも沸かせないことはないけど臭くなるので、陶器のコップ持参か、現地で買うと良い。　スーパーはホテル出てカナル通りを渡り大き,Nov 30| 2019,4
NYの中心街で、直ぐ近くが地下鉄の駅で立地が良いにもかかわらず、騒音がほぼなかったのには驚きました。スタッフも親切で、早朝にJFKに行くには地下鉄よりタクシーの方が確実で良いと教えてくれて、一番手頃なタクシーを手配してくれました。但し、英語が出来ないと良いサービスは受けられないかも知れません、,Oct 23| 2019,4
L'hotel était censé nour fournir une chambre pour trois personnres| mais les grands lits annoncés ne sont pas des kings bed ni même des queen bed mais des lits à une place pour américains moyens soit 120 cm de large !!!! nous avons donc eu une une chambre avec deux lits simples pour trois adultes !!! Ils n'ont rien voulu savoir....Eviter aussi les étages bas| lex drapeaux au dessus de l'entrée tapent sur le mat  en cas de vent....,Oct 15| 2019,2
Great service and very comfortable beds. Rooms and interior a bit outdated.,Oct 12| 2019,4
Dejligt hotel. Og yderst hjælpsomme til at skifte vores værelse ud til ét| der ikke lå ud til gaden - uden ekstra omkostninger. Hotellet ligger perfekt “i midten af Manhatten” i gåafstand til Greenwich collage| Little Italy| downtown Manhatten. Metroen ligger ved hotellet - så det tog 15 minutter at komme til Midttown og Theatre District.,Oct 5| 2019,5
Me gusto el lugar céntrico | buenos lugares a los alrededores. No me gusto que el elevador fuera tan lento,Aug 22| 2019,5

La ubicación excelente. La atención buenísima| la habitación amplia y muy cómoda| no tenia Buena vista pero era muy amplia. Todo muy Bueno| incluso el restaurant que tienen ya sea para desayunar como para comer en cualquier momento. El unico tema era que tenías que conectarte al wi fi cada vez que llegabas al hotel| no era automático.,May 31| 2019,4
Great location in a young and vibrant neighborhood! Hotel is well maintained and staff was always very helpful.,Apr 2| 2019,5

ブランドショップが沢山あるソーホーまで歩いて10分弱という立地でありながら、ホテル近辺には騒がしい人ごみは無く、交通量の多い道路沿いであるため、ひと気がなく治安が不安という事もありませんでした。地下鉄の最寄駅であるカナルストリート駅は、1|2番線／A|C|E線いずれに乗ってもタイムズスクエアまで乗り換えなしで約15~20分。特にA|C|E線の駅出入口はホテル入り口近くにあり、夜遅くでも楽ちんに帰ることができました。また、ブルックリンにもアクセスしやすいです。チェックイン時にフロントの方がフリーWi-Fiの設定をしてくれました。チェックアウト時には違うひとであったものの、フロントのパソコンで日本語に翻訳しながら、空港までのタクシーの手配をしてくれました。部屋は絨毯の床で、冷蔵庫と電子レンジ付き。コーヒーメーカーも便利でした。枕元にUSBポートとコンセント、コーヒーメーカー近くにもコンセントがあり数は充分です。他の方の口コミでは設備が古めとあり、確かにエアコンは古い形で少々うるさかったかもしれません。バスルームも広めで、お湯の出る勢いも充分でした。買い出しに歩いて15分くらいの所にあるホールフーズとターゲット（スーパーです）まで出ました。地下鉄なら駅２つです。ニューヨークのホテルは立地で随分金額が変わりますが、マンハッタンにあってこれだけの設備と清潔で広い部屋ならお手頃な金額設定だと思いました。,Mar 6| 2019,5
Location was great. Very clean rooms and nice staff.,Mar 4| 2019,5
Bra standard och bra service. För en familj med två barn i 11- och 13-årsåldern är det ett utmärkt val i en spännande del av NYC och med goda kommunikationer till alla delar av Manhattan och smidig färd till och från Newark. Frukosten kan man dock välja bort till förmån för någon av de många diners eller delis som finns i närheten.,Mar 1| 2019,4
Top locatie. Metro van JFK stopt letterlijk onder het Hotel. Dus zeer gemakkelijk voor Metro in NY. Vriendelijk personeel en veel leuke restaurants in de buurt. 10 minuten lopen naar Chinatown en Little Italy. 20 minuten lopen naar WTC.,Feb 22| 2019,5
Buena opción en TriBeCa. Cerca de soho y bien conectado a las estaciones de metro. El personal es amable y las habitaciones confortables.,Feb 15| 2019,4
Nice place| nice staff. Only downside was noisy heating in NYC winter times.,Feb 8| 2019,5
Sehr verkehrsgünstig gelegen. U- Bahnstation gleich daneben. Freundliches Personal.,Jan 27| 2019,4
Hotel maravilhoso! Fica ao lado do metrô Linha azul e bem próximo da Linha vermelha. Café| chá e cookies deliciosos diariamente na recepção. Possui um restaurante ótimo ao lado| com acesso por dentro (não precisa ir na rua). Precisei receber uma encomenda antes da minha chegada e deu tudo certo.O quarto era espaçoso e limpo. Havia amenidades de banho de qualidade. Minha única reclamação seria pro chuveiro: era bem quente e fácil de utilizar mas a vazão de água era bem fraca.Quando voltar a NY ficarei nele novamente!!,Jan 15| 2019,5
Escolhemos Hilton por já conhecermos o padrão de qualidade deles e por isso não tivemos nenhum inconveniente em nossa estadia. Quarto grande (para o padrão de NY)| limpo e confortável| mesma coisa para o banheiro. Dispúnhamos de cafeteira|mini geladeira e microondas. Tivemos uma estadia feliz e tranquila ali. O hotel é seguro e os arredores também. Estação de metrô em frente ao hotel. Amamos ficar hospedados ali| certamente foi uma escolha excelente e assertiva.,Jan 14| 2019,5
Geweldige locatie| met bijv. Chinatown en 9/11 op loopafstand. Hotel prima. Alleen wat straatgeluid.,Jan 5| 2019,4
ワールドトレードセンター方面と、ミッドタウン、空港へのアクセスが良い立地で決めました。地下鉄A.C.E銭の、カナルストリート駅のまうえにあります。出口はいくつかあり、ビーチストリートに向かってでるとホテルの真ん前です。バスタブつきで、冷蔵庫は空で自分でいれることができます。食事はしてないので分からないです。空港からは、ジャマイカ線、ハワードビーチ線の、どちらから地下鉄でも同じ時間です。,Jan 4| 2019,3
La excelente atencion del personal y la limpieza de las instalaciones| buena ubicación,Jan 3| 2019,5
無料のドリンクサービス、傘がなくても困らない地下鉄駅の近さが良かった。また利用したいw,Jan 2| 2019,4
Hotel excelente. Limpo| confortável| com funcionários super respeitosos e atenciosos. Recomendo.,Dec 26| 2018,5
O hotel está muito bem localizado com fácil acesso aos pontos turísticos de Nova Iorque. Situado ao lado da estação Canal St. das linhas A/C/E| o Hilton Garden Inn oferece um bom custo benefício na estadia| porém a alimentação tem um custo elevado em comparação com o mercado local. O quarto é confortável contendo frigobar| microondas| wi-fi| televisão e cofre| enquanto o banheiro oferece banheira  e um ótimo chuveiro.,Nov 26| 2018,4
Excelente custo x beneficio em NY. Com fácil acesso e próximo de vários pontos turísticos de metro.,Nov 23| 2018,5
Nice hotel in good location. Close to Canal street station that easily take you wherever you want to go. Walking distance to nice areas| with a lot of good bars and restaurants| like tribeca| soho| nolita and the village.Would recommend it.,Oct 11| 2018,4
Super beliggenhet| til både restauranter| barer og metro. God service på hotellet og deilig seng.,Sep 22| 2018,5
Værelset var ret lille og virkede en anelse slidt. Sengene var mikroskopisk små. Ellers var værelset| som de nu er på Hilton Garden Inns. Det| der var på værelset| fungerede som det skulle.Værelset virkede rent uden at imponere. En dag måtte vi dog konstatere| at værelset endnu ikke var rengjort| da vi returnerede til hotellet om eftermiddagen. Vi frabad os rengøringen| da det blev tilbudt kl. 17:30.Personalet i og ved receptionen var smilende| venlige| imødekommende og servicemindede. En dag havde vi brug for en synål. En sådan var ikke lige på lager| men blev af receptionen fremskaffet og bragt til vores værelse på ca. 10 min. God service!Hotellets placering ovenpå Canal St A/C/E metrostation (og hhv. 200| 400| 500 og 600 m til øvrige Canal St metrostationer) var ideel i ft. transport til seværdigheder og restauranter samt fx JFK lufthavn. Vi boede på 4. sal| og hørte ikke togene under os.Den tilhørende morgenmadsrestaurant - AOA Bar & Grill - bød på et egentlig OK - men meget begrænset - udvalg. Igen uden at imponere| og til en alt for høj pris.Vores samlede indtryk er| at hotellet egentlig er udmærket| men at prisen for værelse samt morgenmad var for høj.,Aug 25| 2018,3
Das Hotel liegt mitten in Tribecca einem kleinen und feinen Viertel in New York. Die Anreise erfolgt sehr einfach mit der E-Linie vom Flughafen JFK.Das Hotel ist sauber und klassisch amerikanisch. Die Lobby macht einen einladenden Eindruck. Die Zimmer sind klein aber fein| mit allem was man braucht. Die Lage ist außerdem sehr ruhig obwohl man mitten im Getümmel ist.,Aug 23| 2018,4
地下鉄が近くてどこへ行くにも便利でした。建物も比較的新しいので、設備等も綺麗でした。食事をする場所にも困らず、トレーダージョーズも徒歩圏内にあり便利でした。２部屋利用したのですが、１部屋は窓際の部屋で良かったのですが、収納が少なくて大変不便で、４泊したので、そこはマイナスでした。もう１部屋は暗かったが、収納は沢山あり良かったです。部屋的には窓際の部屋が楽しかったです。また来る機会があれば、泊まりたいと思いました。,Aug 7| 2018,5
Ottima location|strategica per le molte cose raggiungibili a piedi. Molte metro vicine.,Jul 31| 2018,5
Muy buen Hotel excelente servicio| cómodo y limpio pero deberían de hacer algún mantenimiento para los drenajes cuando te bañas el agua no baja rápido y se llena la bañera pero de todo lo demás muy buen hotel y económico,Jul 3| 2018,4
Muy cómodo| ubicación excelente,Jun 20| 2018,4
El personal que trabaja en la recepción fue extraordinariamente calidad y profesional. Las instalaciones estupendas así como la ubicación. ElEl metro tan solo a unos pasos. Definitivamente mi hotel de elección para el siguiente viaje a Nueva York.,Jun 12| 2018,5
Viejo! La relación precio/valor esta completamente fuera de proporción. Me he hospedado en otros Hilton Garden Inn antes y ninguno tan desgastado y en mal estado como este. Muy viejo y mal cuidado. Es un estado deprimente. Las camas son tan viejas que se hunde el colchón donde duermes. Pague demasiado por este hotel que ni siquiera debería tener 4 estrellas.,Jun 11| 2018,3
Tornerò volentieri  perché per me che a  New York ci vado una volta ogni due anni e ho girato vari alberghi| questo hotel offre senza strafare quelli che serve.....zona tranquilla| metro comodo| camere spaziose è un buonissimo ristorante,May 31| 2018,4
Unluckily| the construction was going on during my stay| so a little bit noisy. The staff are almost ok. Very convenient for traffic. The roomkey didn't work once and had to come down to front desk to make it work again.( That happened when I stayed here before| so this was second time.),May 10| 2018,4
416号室キングベットルームに６泊。バスタブ付き。冷蔵庫・電子レンジ有り。引き出しやクローゼットなど、収納がたっぷりあった。裏側の部屋で眺めは良くないが、表通りに面していないため静か。タオルは毎日交換。シーツは３日に１回交換。ビジネスホテルとシティホテルの中間の印象。地下鉄の駅のすぐ真上にあり、どこに行くにも便利です。,May 5| 2018,4
Personal ist sehr nett. Morgens gibt es in der Lobby kostenfrei Kaffee und Tee. Zum WTC sind es fußläufig 15 Minuten. Um das Hotel herum sind viele nette Restaurants und Cafés.,Apr 10| 2018,4
El personal de recepción muy atento en su mayoría.,Apr 4| 2018,5
Otel guzeldi ancak isitma sistemi asiri sesli calisiyordu. Oda oldukca kucuktu. Resepsiyon gorevlileri nazik ve ilgili idi. Konum olarak yuruyerek de metro ile de oldukca makuldu.,Mar 23| 2018,3
premesso che siamo a New York e gli standard sono completamente diversi dai nostri europei| complessivamente l'hotel ha un ottimo rapporto qualità/prezzo. Inoltre siamo stati per la settimana di capodanno e i prezzi medi| a Manhattan| erano da capogiro. Considerato che ce la siamo cavata con 690€ a testa per 9 notti| a capodanno| direi che l'hotel è stato all'altezza delle aspettative. La camera era sufficientemente grande| con bagno grande e moderno. Letto oversized (queen enorme) e tutto decisamente comodo. A leggere certe recensioni mi chiedo a cosa siano abituati. L'hotel è ben chiaramente descritto come un hotel "essenziale"| per chi vuole spendere poco e stare in un hotel che non sia una bettola. Gli standard di New York sono altissimi e i prezzi sono adeguati. A conti fatti| questo hotel vale la spesa. L'unica pecca| se proprio vogliamo essere puntigliosi| è l'area un pò povera di servizi. Ma appena fuori l'hotel c'è la fermata della metro ACE (blu) e| attraversando la strada| c'è la fermata di Canal St. (rossa). A 500 metri c'è l'area che porta a Little Italy e China Town dove trovare ristoranti| negozi| e qualunque cosa cerchiate... Basta fare una passeggiatina e vi ritrovate nel "traffico" New Yorkese.,Jan 12| 2018,4
goede bedden| leuke ligging- tegen het zakendistrict aan en het trendy Soho,Jan 11| 2018,4
Hotellin huoneissa ei ole mitään vikaa ja hotellilta löytyy kuntosali jossa saa hien pintaan. Hotelli ei sinänsä sijaitse kauniilla paikalla| mutta siitä kävelee nopeasti Tribecan mukaville kaduille ja Sohoon. Metropysäkki aivan vieressä. Aamiaisen pystyi ostamaan erikseen alakerran hotellista| mikä oli ok| mutta huomattavasti paremmat aamiaiset saa lähialueen ravintoloista.,Jan 10| 2018,4
Hôtel très bien situé dans Manhattan. Desservit par les principales lignes de métro (ACE1) et à proximité immédiate de Soho| Chelsea et Meatpacking. Chambre spacieuse| propre et confortable. Chauffage assez bruyant en revanche. Rapport/qualité très intéressant. Personnel disponible et agréable. A conseiller!,Jan 10| 2018,4
クリスマスから年末にかけて家族4人（夫婦＋子供2人)で滞在しました。滞在中は観光名所を中心に毎日出歩きましたが、アップタウンへいくもダウンタウンへいくも、地下鉄の最寄駅が多く、大変助かりました。ホテル自体は、可もなく不可もなく。設備はやや古め、空気が乾燥するエアコンが気になり、他は新しくはないもののメンテナンスされていて気になりませんでした。朝食は5日間滞在にはかなり飽きてしまいました。（かつちょっと高い）ホテルの従業員の方の意識は高かったことも、追記しておきます。,Jan 2| 2018,4
Aufgrund der Lage| ist dieses Hotel sehr empfehlenswert. Die Zimmer wirken zwar schon ein wenig veraltet| waren aber sauber| und die sind Betten sehr bequem. Subway| Chinatown und div.Sehenswürdigkeiten sind vom Hotel aus leicht erreichbar.,Dec 27| 2017,3
Lage: direkt an der blauen A| C & E Subway. Viele nette Restaurants in der Nähe| auch Chinatown| Little Italy| SoHo| NoHo sind gut zu erreichen. Zimmer für NY-Verhältnisse recht groß. Möblierung etwas altbacken| also typisch amerikanisch. In der Lobby gab es morgens kostenlosen Kaffee| Tee & Kakao. Frühstücken waren wir immer außerhalb des Hotels. Direkt zum Hotel gehört eine Pizzeria/Burger-Laden. Sehr lecker war es da. Der Service war gut. Check-in/-out klappte prima. Das Hotel kann man gerne weiterempfehlen.,Dec 25| 2017,4
Jättebra läge precis vid tunnelbana (expresstation). Helt ok i övrigt| mitt emellan hotell- och motellkänsla. Bra utrustade rum med kaffe| kyl och micro vilket underlättar livet omman stannar lite längre. Tyvärr mycket högljudd ac och kyl| så dessa fick vi stänga av/vrida ner på natten. Bra ac annars. Även högljudda is- och vendingmachines i korridoren som ingen verkade använda. Skön säng. Mycket bra förvaring. Mycket rent och snyggt. Trevlig personal.,Dec 25| 2017,4
Boa localização| quarto razoável!!,Dec 6| 2017,4
Receptionisten var otrevlig och kunde vi kunde inte få vårat rum trots att vi kom efter check-in tiden. Istället fick vi bo i ett skitigt rum som vi hittade en kackerlacka på i badrummet. När vi klagade så sa hon att det var det enda rummet dom hade just nu men att vi skulle kunna byta dan efter. Dan efter var det en annan person i receptionen som inte fått den informationen och dom hade fortfarande inget annat rum ledigt så vi fick bo kvar i kackerlacksrummet. Tredje dagen fick vi äntligen byta till det rum vi skulle haft från början. Allt detta problem och ingen form av kompensation för dom skylde på allt från Hotels.Com till Thanksgivinghelgens överbokning. Området som hotellet låg i har också sätt sina bästa dagar. Har efter hemkomsten försökt maila hotellet för att få tag på någon ansvarig men inget svar| dåligt !!,Nov 30| 2017,2
Bra hotell| centralt,Nov 3| 2017,5
Smala sängar| tillägg för utsikt mot Tribeca innebar buller från trafikkorsning. Buller från t-bana.,Nov 2| 2017,3

Super hotel med god og venlig serviceminded personale. Tingene fungerede på hotellet. Fint ophold. Hotellet levede op til vores forventninger. Bl.a internettet var super stabilt og godt. Morgenmad fin men ikke pragende. Aircondition fungerer godt og let at betjene.Værelserne var pæne og rene| og der var plads til tøj og kufferter|,Jul 16| 2017,4
La posizione è ottima| però sotto le finestre il traffico è assolutamente costante 24ore anche molto pressante sia come qualità dell'aria che rumori| la camera è ben isolata quindi finisci per stare tutto il tempo con la finestra chiusa e l'aria condizionata.L'albergo in sé impersonale| con gli impiegati che si vede che fanno fatica ad essere gentili in una città in cui nessuno veramente tollera il prossimo.Medio| non credo che ci tornerò mai più e possibilmente preferirei anche non tornare a New York proprio per niente.,Jul 2| 2017,3
excelente servicio,Jun 14| 2017,5

Et rigtig godt hotel med godt service. Placeret fantastisk i New York,Mar 20| 2017,4
Já havíamos nos hospedado antes no Garden Inn Tribeca. Eu e minha esposa adoramos esta região de NYC. Na anterior o quarto em que ficamos era maior e com vista para o Uptown da 6ª Av. Desta fez foi um quarto menor e com vista para o pátio interno das máquinas de ar cond. Porém| com cama tão confortável quanto e mais tranquilo. Era o quarto disponível para um check-in às 10:00. Três dias depois e por iniciativa da própria recepção| nos contactaram se gostaríamos de trocar por um quarto maior. Optamos por permanecer no quarto atual| do que fazermos mudança de bagagem já aberta| além do fato de que o quarto que estávamos ocupando| apesar de pequeno era bastante confortável e tranquilo.O bar AOA do hotel é bastante agradável e animado e vive cheio. A estação de metro das linhas azuis (A| C| E) fica na porta. Não podemos avaliar o café da manhã| pois por hábito não gostamos das frituras do café padrão americano| optamos por uma caminhada de 5 quarteirões para o Le Pain Quotidien da Grand St.,Mar 17| 2017,5
Hotellet har gångavstånd till WTC| samt shoppingvaruhuset Century 21 & Brooklyn Bridge mm. Nära tunnelbanan.,Mar 9| 2017,4
prima toeristehotel| wat 'oubollig' in beige en bruin.,Mar 6| 2017,4
ブルックリンへもアップタウンへも便利なAラインの駅の真上ということで、地下鉄移動派の僕にとってはマンハッタン滞在時によく利用してます。SOHOも近く、買い物などは徒歩で行けるので便利です。大きくはないホテルなので快適です。通り側でない部屋は日中若干暗めですが、アクティブな方には関係ないと思います。時期によって価格が違うので、リーズナブルなときはぜひおすすめできます。フロント横に午前中にサービスされるコーヒーも◎。,Jan 19| 2017,5
El hotel es perfecto para estar en new York.Tiene una estación de metro en la entrada y eso hace muy fácil moverse a cualquier lugar.el sector es tranquilo aunque no hay mucho comercio cerca. El restaurante es una buena opción si uno no quiere moverse.,Jan 10| 2017,5
Godt alternativ| pris tatt i betraktning. Relativt stort rom. Nærme flere metroer og godt utvalg spisesteder. Anbefales. Minus var veldig uregelmessig rengjøring| ofte så sent at vi hadde kommet tilbake til hotellet. Prøvde ikke frokost (dyr)| men flere gode alternativer i nærheten.,Jan 7| 2017,4
地下鉄ブルーラインACEの駅の前にあります。ソーホーやチャイナタウンも徒歩圏内です。フロントの対応良く、朝はコーヒーのサービスもあります。唯一の難点は、主要道路に近く夜中少しうるさかったことです。,Jan 7| 2017,5
Lage direkt an der Metrostation Canalstreet (A|C und E-Trains)| in max. 5 Min. zu Fuß sind 2 weitere Canalstreet-Stationen (N|Q|R|W|1) erreichbar| man kommt überall hin| ist in ca. 15 Min. in Midtown Manhattan| die Metrocard kostet derzeit 31 Dollar/7 Tage. Check out ist um 12 h| wir konnten kostenlos bis 13 h verlängern| danach kostet jede Stunde 15 Dollar! Die Koffer können am letzten Tag kostenlos abgestellt werden.Wir hatten ohne Frühstück gebucht| daher keine Bewertung dazu. Das| was angeboten wurde| ist üblich für USA| also Cornflakes| Rührei| Bacon etc.| für knapp 17 Dollar/Person. In 2-10 Min. zu Fuß entfernt sind mehrere gute Gelegenheiten zum Frühstücken. Preislich ist alles dabei| jedoch sollten mindestens 8-10 Dollar/Person kalkuliert werden| mehr geht locker...Gebucht war ein 26 m² Zimmer mit King-Size Bett|was wir immer empfehlen würden. Möglich sind auch 2 Queen-Size Betten. Aber bitte nicht ein Queen-Bett für 2 Personen buchen| das ist dann wie im Wohnwagen...Das Zimmer war ok| das Bad klein aber in Ordnung| Aussicht nach vorne auf die Straße. Die Klimaanlage dient als Heizung und macht die ganze Nacht Lärm. Das hat den Vorteil| dass man den Krach von den Autos nicht so hört... Schlafen ist nur für Hartgesottene durchgehend möglich. Wir würden das Hotel wegen der Klimaaanlage nicht nochmal buchen| aber auch nur deswegen. Das Hotel erscheint aus deutscher Sicht zu teuer (ca. 230 Euro/Nacht)| ist für NYC aber normal wenn man keine 15 m² Kammer haben möchte.,Jan 6| 2017,3
Propre| bien situé| parfait. Rien a ajouter sinon que c'estu must go sans probleme et les prix quand j'y suis allé était plus que tres mega conpetitif.,Jan 3| 2017,5
Excelente atención| comodo| buenas tarifas y  muy buena ubicación en NY,Dec 29| 2016,4
We stayed here 8 friends together and this was our first time in Tribeca area.Location is excellent and many of the best restaurants in the neighborhood.  Also good location for shops at Broadway.  Rooms were fine| some of them rather small but with all facilities needed.  The service of the staff was very good and they were helpful.  The restaurant| the bar and breakfast was good.  Would suggest this hotel to friends| both for location and standard of the hotel.,Nov 30| 2016,4
Ficamos 7 noites no hotel. A princípio o quarto reservado era pequeno (as categorias de quartos do hotel dizem respeito ao tamanho das camas| e não a área total do quarto)| mas isso foi prontamente resolvido pela recepção. Serviço impecável da recepção e dos serviços de quarto| nos ajudaram com muita boa vontade em tudo que precisamos. Pontos positivos: a vizinhança (o melhor do Soho e do Tribeca em curtas caminhadas)| a proximidade do metrô (buscávamos utilizar ao máximo as linhas A| C e E do metro| pela saída ser do lado da entrada do hotel) e o restaurante AOA| tanto no café da manhã quanto no jantar (pizza muito boa).O único ponto a melhorar é o serviço de wifi| que era muito instável e simplesmente não funcionou na nossa primeira noite - algo que o hotel procurou remediar sempre que possível (quando não foi possível| procurou nos compensar de alguma forma)| mas que é uma questão de buscar um melhor fornecedor para o serviço.O hotel confirmou nossas expectativas e com certeza consideraremos em uma futura volta à cidade.,Nov 29| 2016,4
En genaral el hotel es bueno y con excelente ubicación| mi experiencia personal no fue nada buena| me "cobraron" dos veces sobregirando mi tarjeta| nunca pudieron arreglarlo| fueron descorteses y hasta groseros con nosotros|  todavía llegando a Mexico llamamos y hasta el telefono nos colgaron (joe) Muy mal servicio en ese sentido| ya pasó una semana y siguen teniendo mas de 1000 dlls mios que no han regresado.,Nov 29| 2016,1

Helt ok hotel| men gata "canal street" kan virke litt rufsete. Vi følte oss helt trygge under hele oppholdet.,Oct 14| 2016,4
Quiet location. Room size was good| but there were bed bugs so couldn't sleep well. Room keys didn't work repeatedly| so annoying..,Sep 24| 2016,3
We found everything to be quite nice| clean| and peaceful.The staff there were very professional and took the time to listened  to my questions.  I felt very much at home there.,Aug 18| 2021,5
The shuttle service was great,Aug 18| 2021,5
This property is not as advertised. There is no free parking| required $25   a day valet. The pool is closed and has been for over a year. I paid for a room and breakfast every morning and they did not see that at the desk and I spent half a day on the phone with orbitz trying to get that fixed. When I did| the lady at the front desk still gave me attitude about it| except Crystal- she is wonderful! The room was less than clean and someone had set our room alarm to 4:20am and we have two exhausted children (I’m all for a 4:20 joke but COME ON). There was a “Jesus fish” painted in wax or crayon on our bathroom mirror that was super creepy| sheets had a stain| curtains stained and found old Cheerios and pills around the beds. ALSO even though I paid in full for our stay I was required to put a $400 deposit on my room ($100 a night) which I was not aware of before check in. Do yourself a favor and stay at the Marriott next door!,Aug 17| 2021,2
Everything was good except they did not answer the phone for the shuttle.,Aug 17| 2021,5
They advertise a pool as an amenity and when we arrived| the staff said the pool is closed indefinitely.  They advertise free parking| and when we arrived| they are charging $25 a day plus tax. We had to park on the street. This was not a pleasant stay and we will never ever stay at this property again.,Aug 17| 2021,2
Clean room| fair price| courteous staff| and appreciated the frequent airport shuttle service.,Aug 16| 2021,4

The hotel it’s a little old,Aug 11| 2021,4
This property is very convenient due to its proximity to JKF airport.,Aug 11| 2021,5
We understand that due to the pandemic and though the food personnel was great| clean and friendly| there were very few choices on the menu.,Aug 11| 2021,5
While this hotel is convenient to the airport| it has little by way of food. Meals are over-priced and tasteless. Snacks only available for 2 hours on weekends. No nearby places to walk to get things.The shuttle is difficult to call from airport - their phone line (mentioned by others) needs serious repair and courtesy.The hotel is VERY NOISY in the corridors; for travelers needing sleep this is a big minus.,Aug 11| 2021,3
Stay was short due to a flight but it was comfortable. Only negative was the AC unit was noisy but otherwise a pleasant stay.,Aug 10| 2021,4
The housekeeping staff was extremely nice,Aug 10| 2021,4
Amazing staff and best receptionist ever,Aug 7| 2021,5
The check in reception was excellent| helpful. I was not happy with the housekeeping staff repeated knocks on door at check-out. We had previously contacted front desk to tell them we would be 20 minutes beyond check out time. I was was dressing for a special occasion and felt bullied. I am an airline employee and expect normal courtesy in such situations.,Aug 7| 2021,4

Needs a total renovation!Should not charge the price I paid!Joanna,Aug 5| 2021,3
Met my needs for travel.,Aug 4| 2021,5
The plus is the vicinity to JFK airport and the shuttle service. Very little customer orientation. Limited dining. Cleanliness could be better.,Aug 3| 2021,3
Friendly staff but the scent was not appealing throughout the hotel. The restaurant served stale food for dinner. The chicken (wings and strips) were all bad and the sauces were expired,Aug 3| 2021,3
Recycling available,Aug 1| 2021,3
We were told that he shuttle to the airport is 30 minutes and arrived 5:20am for 5:30pm bus| waited until 5:40 for a shuttle to come but was told it’s for the airline crew| the second one arrived shortly afterwards but it was an unpleasant experience to have to wait almost 20 minutes in the early morning with young kids.And the air conditioner in our room is very very LOUD!,Aug 1| 2021,4

The property was really nice & I liked the view from my room. I loved the staff. I just didn’t like that it was valet parking only.,Jul 28| 2021,5
I got charged 2 times for 1 night with my babies. First time when I used Expedia app with my $40 discount on Amex. Second time when I swiped my other cc for deposit. It was a different cc. All in all the hotel was great| clean and beautiful. I used it twice to/from my trip to Europe. I just hope they get back to me sooner than later with my issue. Highly recommend| mistakes happen.,Jul 28| 2021,5
No microwave in the room| we had to use their public microwave. Other than that No complaints.,Jul 27| 2021,5

I've arrived to JFK around 10PM and tried to call the hotel to ask about their shuttle services. I've been disconnected 3 times. Rude  and slow receptionist.  About 60 minutes later the shuttle showed up. During the registration they completely forgot to give me the voucher for the prepaid breakfast. When I reminded her| she made faces and handled the voucher to me without to say anything.  The room was ready| however the floor and carpet were dirty and worn| bathroom was just ok. We booked the room for 4 person. There were only  2 towels in the room and I asked for extra.. My wife walked down to the receptionist desk an hour later| because we still not received it. Another promise| we will bring it to your room momentarily.. Well| we never got it..When I complained to the "manager"  next morning| he blamed the Covid situation (rooms are set up for 2 guest)| he smiled| showed 0 (zero) professionalism and never been able to say "I'm sorry"  John| the manager completely failed on that morning. Avoid this place if you can!,Jul 25| 2021,1
Really noisy. We can hear everything in the other rooms. Need a renovation,Jul 25| 2021,3
I expected a level of quality from a Hilton hotel that was just not what I got at all. The facility itself is was a concrete block that looked like it had last been renovated 50 years ago. It advertises itself as being 1/4 mile from JFK. This is incredibly misleading if not an outright lie. It was a good 10 min drive to get to the terminals.The staff was friendly and helpful but the Expedia confirmation number was not coming up in their system and it took about 20min to resolve that. Apparently they had been having problems with Expedia all day. Note to self to book directly next time.,Jul 25| 2021,2
Close to the airport!,Jul 24| 2021,3
It was very clean it should been more towels,Jul 22| 2021,4
Very Nice Clean close to highway easy access,Jul 22| 2021,4
The staff made my stay all the more better,Jul 22| 2021,5
The most disappointing thing about this hotel is that for almost $200 a night they can’t even give you a free cup of coffee,Jul 22| 2021,2
I like the building| not too big of a hotel. The room size was good too.  It was adequately clean in rooms and hallways.  Dislikes:  No microwaves in rooms. Had to go all the way down to lobby restaurant to use one very small cheap microwave. The refrigerator was not plugged in as we thought and our food spoiled overnight.  The air conditioners are Very Very Loud and I'm not a light sleep.  One desk person couldn't find my reservations under Travelocity and had to wait for another person to figure it out.  The meals in the Restaurant is over priced and not tasteful. Better to eat out or use Uber Eats.  Travelocity did not mention the $100 deductible per night as I recall.  This you had to pay on checking in.  Its Valet Parking Only!  Wasn't aware of that also.,Jul 21| 2021,4
The stay was good | and staff was friendly only problem we faced was even though I had called and asked about airport pickup they didn’t mention that it is only till one of the air train station and not till the terminals .,Jul 21| 2021,3
Close to airport Dining options,Jul 21| 2021,3
All the amenities were available,Jul 21| 2021,4
The air conditioning in room was excessively noisy| the toilet was not working properly & was noisy all night| and the bathroom smelled unclean,Jul 20| 2021,2
For starters| the Hitlon shuttle driver was extremely rude!!! When i got to the hotel| there wasnt a line yet the staff seen me standing there and not one person said next. I had to walk up and say can someone help me.  I was given the wrong room amd when i asked to have it corrected i eas told there were noore rooms.,Jul 20| 2021,1
Good service,Jul 20| 2021,5
Nice hotel and very friendly yet professional staff,Jul 20| 2021,5
The evening staff at the front desk is Amazing wonderful customer service,Jul 20| 2021,3
The hotel staff members were extremely friendly and helpful. We were given a corner room on the 11th floor. Since the hotel is located across the highway from JFK airport| heading the muted sounds of planes taking off was unavoidable. But| the limited noice did not subtract from a comfortable stay. The only item not present in the room was a UBS port. I thought that a bit odd for a Hilton hotel.,Jul 20| 2021,4
The staff were friendly| but the place was dated. While the room was clean| the carpets in the hallway and room smelled.,Jul 19| 2021,2
Staff was very fast and friendly! I’ll be staying here again on my way home back from Morocco!,Jul 19| 2021,5
Did not like the parking situation,Jul 18| 2021,5

Satisfying,Jul 16| 2021,4
You guys have many ways to improve,Jul 16| 2021,3
The staff were friendly and the food was great. The air conditioner was very loud and I could hear the person in the next room very loud and around 2a.m. someone turned on their shower which was so loud it scared me. I also found a roach crawling in the shower.,Jul 16| 2021,3
Staff was awesome!  Wanda made the check in process a pleasure.,Jul 16| 2021,4
Very nice| spacious| would go back,Jul 15| 2021,5
it was nice,Jul 13| 2021,5
disappointed in the bathrooms | drains clogged| bath fixtures broken| in need of replacement | room smelled| hilton used to be a name you could trust,Jul 13| 2021,3
My room A/C blower motor was loud| had to turn T.V. up when A/C came on . then back down when it went off.  room carpet had several stains in it needs cleaning.Room had no T.V. guide for channels???Staff was very good i would say.  also breakfast sasuage was a cheap tastless brand.  Try Jimmy dean sausage to compare.,Jul 11| 2021,3
The worse services and bad costumer services i had to much problem with bad costumer services not profecional at sll its so frustrated,Jul 10| 2021,1
I was promise free parkin with my stay that wasn't true I had to pay $90 for 3 days 3 nights,Jul 9| 2021,5
Check-in was most unpleasant in whole my life and i live in USA for 12 years and I traveled a lot.  Receptionist  was inspecting my credit card so thoroughly that  made me feel extremely uncomfortable| he didn’t tell me upfront what are requirements for credit card payment| he didn’t explain what kind of credit card he needs  but when I was ready to slide my card for payment   he told me : “I must see you credit card first”. He took it and examined my credit card very carefully from both sides. And returned it to me saying| it’s ok to pay with it. I stayed in many different hotels but nobody in a past was questioning my credit card so rudely. I was expecting more professionalism from management of Hilton hotels.,Jul 9| 2021,3
room was smelling wet mold on pillow and bed sheets,Jul 9| 2021,1
Location was great for a night's stay before you fly early morning. Staff was pleasant enough. At check- in| Told me I could use a different credit card when I check out| but a different front office staff will not take a different credit card| said that they couldn't change from the one I gave them the evening before. Never had that problem at other hotels.,Jul 8| 2021,3
Arrival was difficult. Shuttle could not pick us up at terminal 4. Would have had to take a train to federal circle. Too much luggage to handle that so had to take a taxi. Leaving in morning there were a bunch of people lazing around outside smoking pot. On a very undesirable neighborhood.,Jul 7| 2021,3
It was ok I had better service. When I checked in the staff was absolutely nice and helpful. After that nothing I requested housekeeping just one day out 4 nights and nothing. The bar staff was awesome. That’s my spot,Jul 6| 2021,3
Decent hotel for one night if you need to sleep before a flight the next day. They offer a shuttle to pick you up| but at your terminal of arrival. It requires to take the air train to meet at a specific point. The shuttle to drop you off will drop you at your terminal of departure. It is not too far but the shuttle does a few stops to pick up crews and drop off other passengers. So factor that in. The food is just ok. At the time we were there they would not serve you due to Covid restrictions. It was only “to go”. I don’t mind the “to go” utensils| but the food was really low average and I was very disappointed by the drinks at the bar (cocktails not good| wine not good)Room was very clean and we slept really well.,Jul 5| 2021,3
I really enjoy my stays at this Hilton. My complaint is why is the pool still not opened? I have stayed here at least 10 times and really love this hotel. Staff is wonderful| food is amazing.,Jul 5| 2021,3
No one showed up for the valet parking. Had to go inside the hotel to find out.,Jul 5| 2021,4
THE BED WAS BEYONDD COMFYYY OMG,Jul 4| 2021,5
I ABSOLUTELY enjoyed my stay at the HILTON..From the staff|  to the rooms|  to the food and hospitality.. Everything was EXCELLENT.. I just wished I could’ve stayed longer😃,Jul 3| 2021,5
We really enjoyed our stay at the hotel. It was right off the expressway and easy to get into the city. The hotel and room was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful.,Jul 3| 2021,5
I stayed here two nights prior to my departure from JFK airport.  I specifically chose the Hilton JFK because of its proximity to JFK| and the fact it was a Hilton and I felt there would be a higher level of service. The staff were all very friendly and the first night was great.  The second night was a different story.  I woke up about 1:30 in the morning chocking.  I was coughing heavily and realized that my room was filled with a strong odor. I realized that the smell was coming from the venting system|  Moreover| the smell was clearly the smell of marijuana. Now| what someone does in their room is their business| but when it affects me in my room| then it becomes mine.  I called the front desk clerk and he was very apologetic and offered to send me an air freshener| which he admitted would do little but otherwise there was nothing he said he could do. He said that the smell could be coming from anywhere on the floor and that more than likely the occupants were smoking in their and blowing the smoke into the vent.  He did not offer to change rooms but said he would speak with his manager in the morning and make note in their system. I opened the window as much as I could and tried to go back to sleep. The next day I woke up with a searing head and feeling sick.  I spoke to the desk clerk who was again apologetic and who said she would speak to the manager.  I also emailed the manager and have not received the courtesy of even a response almost a week later.,Jul 3| 2021,1
The hotel was very nice quiet after hours.,Jul 2| 2021,4
Really nice| felt comfortable in this hotel. Superb experience.,Jul 1| 2021,5
Cool!,Jun 30| 2021,5
Great front desk service from the ladies,Jun 30| 2021,5
The staff was great but the premise is not of the Hilton standards I know off.,Jun 28| 2021,5
Property was nice| but did not have a store on site for convenience.,Jun 25| 2021,4
Due to lack of amenities should be downgraded to a Hampton Inn.,Jun 25| 2021,3
My Hotel room was noisy and I could not sleep because of the noise coming from the AC,Jun 25| 2021,1
TV in room was not working well. Missed NBA game last night. Called for help and no one came.,Jun 24| 2021,4
The staff was exceptional. I was a little disappointed in the quality of  how hotel was maintained. I expected better quality from Hilton.,Jun 21| 2021,4
I love everything about this hotel,Jun 21| 2021,5
Everything about this property is great. I am from Jamaica and it is easy for me to get to my family in the area or head to Brooklyn.,Jun 21| 2021,5
This hotel is great and convenient. I always stay here.,Jun 21| 2021,5
The hotel was easy to locate| very clean| nice size rooms and very comfy beds. Lobby area closes at 10 am so not food or drink| parking is valet only 27.00 per day. Had a very early flight so could not partake of breaksfast that was paid for in price.,Jun 19| 2021,4
Close to the airport; shuttle pick up,Jun 17| 2021,5
Not a bad place to stay. It's New York. Period.,Jun 16| 2021,4
The shower area had mildew and i found previous guests hair all over the place. The bed did not smell fresh.,Jun 15| 2021,2
This property was dirty. The linen was uncomfortable. I asked several times for a new set of linen which I never received. I specifically asked for no room service yet they went in my room any way. The smoke detector had been messed with and was hanging of the wall. The hotel is extremely noisy and the grounds are covered in trash.,Jun 15| 2021,1
Hotel stay was great accept for terrible parking situation! Valet parking only!! No nearby street parking available!! Had to park and walk 1/2 mile.,Jun 15| 2021,4
The hotel I normally stay at was completely booked so I opted yo stay here. I definitely will not be returning. When you pull up to the hotel it looks like it’s well kept. The lobby area is really nice and check in was smooth. It’s everything else that was disappointing. First was parking. When we got to the hotel most of the spots are roped off fir valet. There were only 7-10 spots that were not roped off and I happened to get one of them. At dinner time I tried ordering from a couple of places using Grubhub. Neither place delivered to the area (not sure why) so I had to go get the food. Of course by the time I returned there was no parking and the valet said the lot was full. His suggestion was to park on the street (no parking) or go over to the Hampton next door. The Hampton had plenty of spots but the attendant there was very rude and gave me a hard time before allowing me to park in one of the Hilton spots (which I didn’t realize they were designated Hilton spots until the next morning). The room was showing it’s she. While the room was a decent size| the furniture upholstery was fading| there were chips in the wood| the shower curtain was piling. It was clean - just old. If you don’t have a car and not too particular about the room this place is fine. But there are better places to stay in the area.,Jun 13| 2021,2
No breakfast. So we are still paying the same for less amenities. I understand| it’s covid. But we have been to other hotels recently that have had breakfast. The front desk said there would be an ala carte breakfast the next morning| but there was nothing| not even fruit. The shuttle to and from the airport was nice and the drivers were friendly. No complaints about the hotel room itself.,Jun 13| 2021,3
We liked the shower| the shower head was powerful!,Jun 9| 2021,5
Clean and well decorated.,Jun 8| 2021,4
The front desk staff especially Ms. Griffin kept me from having a total melt down during my stay.  I was completely stressed and they made sure I was ok and had everything I needed.,Jun 7| 2021,5
I have stayed here every few weeks as I fly in to see my girlfriend. I cannot believe that you have to pay to park at a hotel you are paying for anyway. Additionally| the past two times| the hallway smelled like marijuana (very strong odor) and the A/C unit sounded like it was rumbling out of the wall. I'm not one to complain| but I don't think I would want to stay there as I keep flying back to NY every few weeks.,Jun 7| 2021,2
Diamond at the front desk was very pleasant. She is always so nice and friendly every time we stay their.,Jun 7| 2021,5
Check in and out OK| airport shuttle was punctual and friendly| breakfast overpriced. The worst thing was an AC so noisy that I couldn't sleep. Come on people.,Jun 6| 2021,3
It was an all round great stay. Water and masks always available no charge and very friendly staff.,Jun 6| 2021,5
No microvave in the room and no drinking water | one toilet paper in the room for four persons during our stay.,Jun 4| 2021,4
Place is showing its age with no updates.  Carpeting| counters| bedding| rooms.  W/o fail I prepay my breakfast and NEVER are given the voucher at check in.,Jun 4| 2021,3
The bed linens looked like it wasn’t changed the pillows was flat the spread or comforter was old and tattered I had brought my sheets and pillows. Two bath towels for two people for two days overhaul was not satisfied,Jun 3| 2021,4
I stay there wit my three children. Only two towels in the bathroom I requested towels multiple times after two days then I was able to get two more towels. I call the front desk| even went down to the front desk I was told someone will bring it up. I was so disappointed in the service at this hotel. Never again am I staying here.,Jun 1| 2021,2
the bath room has only hair shampoo & conditioner| body lotion| one hand soap| not even shower cap and body soap.  The trash containers have no plastic bags on them.  Wondering how clean they are ...,May 31| 2021,2
Noise from adjoining room kept us up all night| had to call security 3 times to finally get them to quiet down,May 31| 2021,1
The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was comfortable.,May 31| 2021,4
Staff need to take few courses in customer service,May 30| 2021,2
Wet & cold weather but slept good,May 29| 2021,5
I waited for one hour for the van to come pick me up at federal there were seven of us we are business people we would’ve taken a cab had we known that we would had to wait that long we found out once we got to the hotel that the van and it was only two were picking up airline crew members come on Hilton we know that they have a contract but you should want to haveThe business travel back the people at the hotel were wonderful but you’re only sending them up for failure they heard complaint after complaint after complaint that is not fair you need more ground transportation JFK airport is too busy for two Vance you need a third on,May 29| 2021,5
Lovely inside but area is a bit rough looking. Overall| a good value.,May 26| 2021,4
The first room the air condition unit was above the door and when it came on it sound like a loud dump truck engine running.  Also| when we flushed the to toilet| it continue to run| we tried shaking the handle and it didn't stop. We arrived after midnight and was too tired to  call the front desk that night and decided we would just shut the bathroom door and deal with it| needless to say| didn't get any rest all night.  When the air came on it was loud and when it shut off the sound of the water running from the toilet.  The TV had to be played at a loud volume in order to hear it while the air condition was running and when it shut off the TV would be too loud | finally I just left the volume low and listened when the air shut off.  Thenext morning we complained| they did change our room. The bathroom situation was fixed | however the loud air condition was still there.,May 25| 2021,2
Positives: Great service| clean room| free basic Wifi in room| free airport shuttle| bar and restaurant on lobby level is convenient (but expensive).Negatives: No breakfast included for basic room (not sure if more expensive rooms have breakfast included)| not enough (or any) wall outlets in the room| the outlets in the lamps seemed slow to charge my cell phones and battery packs.,May 24| 2021,4
What I like about the property it was nice and clean and it wasn't too busy. I would like if they had the pool up and running because it was very hot and also the room should have a microwave because when you're traveling with kids you need to warm stuff up for the kids.,May 24| 2021,4
Staff was very personal & helpful. I had a lot of problems using my executive floor key in one of the elevators. & I didn't know the pool wasn't accessible. But| i enjoyed my stay. I didn't expect to have to pay $25 a night for parking though. That was unfair. Finding that out during checkin. Considering all the deposits daily & the $16 dollars a day for breakfast. Never experience so many extra fee added on checkin. For a trip I already paid for months in advance.,May 24| 2021,5
The hotel is conveniently located.  The staff is very gracious.  The rooms and the general areas are very clean and the bed was super comfortable. In spite of the large number of guests it was quiet.   The only thing that was unfortunate cannot be the hotel's fault.  They had a lovely bar and restaurant area but| due to NYC rules| they were open ONLY for take-out and the menu was limited.  This was a family event and we could not gather as we wished.  We truly hope NYC begins to allow the hotels to do what the do best!,May 23| 2021,5
Booked a suite was told by Valet it was $50 per car but to “give him” $30 got to the room and it was dirty garbage left in the can and a rotten apple left in the table. Was then told by housekeeping they could offer me an already free breakfast or 15% off the bill,May 22| 2021,2
The Hilton has been there for ever and it shows. Pros: close to JFK & Van Wyck expy. Valet guy was nice. Room clean.Cons: took 24 hrs. for clean towels. Not once did anyone ask me if I needed help.  On site food overpriced. Pay valet parking only. Plenty of street parking for now. Area is scary after dark. ask for a room facing the airport because they are building another hotel next to it. Noise and dust start at 8 am.,May 22| 2021,2
I liked the room but the bed was not so great. It was not comfortable and the AC was so very loud I barely slept. When I’m in meetings I couldn’t hear clearly. Also the place was very smoky and I have Asthma. It said non-smoking,May 21| 2021,4
They advertised free breakfast| and it was only for purchase. Had to even pay for coffee!  Also advertised free parking| but the only spaces available were if you used valet service| which we found out later was $50/day. Front desk was always a line to get to talk to and when you did| they were not friendly.,May 21| 2021,3
Room was clean but noisy.,May 19| 2021,2
My stay was well| food was ok| nothing fancy. Employees made sure the environment was welcoming.,May 17| 2021,4
No microwave in the room and my room was dusty,May 16| 2021,4
Everything was perfect execpt the rude front desk girls. They were both unprofessional and rude to say the least.,May 15| 2021,4
Customer service was great| my room wasn't cleaned. A plastic cup was in the bathroom.  The heating system wasn't working.  My toddler complained about being cold. Very disappointed,May 14| 2021,3
the facilities were good| as was the service.  I give them four stars,May 13| 2021,4
Just  pleasant and clean,May 9| 2021,4
Allí good,May 8| 2021,4
I was rather disappointed all the way around.,May 7| 2021,3
Convenient location,May 6| 2021,5
Run down property .. nothing works | cockroach in the room,May 6| 2021,1
Busy place took awhile to get checked in staff very helpful accommodations above average,May 3| 2021,4
There was no coordination with this hotel what so ever. I made my reservation through Expedia and as always these hotels can never find the reservation. When my husband got to the hotel at midnight. They told him they had no reservations for him and no rooms available after he just flew on a plane for hours. They did nothing to accommodate them so I had to call in the middle of the night to complain and get someone to look up the reservation that was made. The staff needs training on how to find reservations from third parties. Don’t ever make reservations through 3rd party companies it’s not with the headache and stress. I didn’t even get the room I reserved,May 3| 2021,3
Bathroom was making noise all nite soap look like it’s used already no microwave to hot my kids food I really didn’t like this at all thank you,May 3| 2021,1
We used this hotel as an overnight place to stay for airport service.  It was close and convenient to JFK.  Rooms were clean and beds were very comfortable.  Parking was tight and we used on street parking about a block away.,Apr 29| 2021,4
Easy to find and quick check in. Front desk staff were very helpful with check in.,Apr 29| 2021,5
For it's size and Name I was disappointed parking wasn't available on site,Apr 27| 2021,5
It was very clean.,Apr 27| 2021,4
The staff was rude except for shuttle driver who was a breath of fresh air.There was a mechanical system noise that kept us up all night!,Apr 26| 2021,1
It was amazing and very useful  to get at time to the airport .,Apr 24| 2021,4
Not so good. Temperature control fan was making terrible noise all the time. No space for two people to sit and work on computers. No small dining table and chairs to sit and eat even though we were told to take our dinner to our room to eat. Room design is not good with two large queen beds instead of one king bed. Bathroom faucet is far from the sink few inches and water pressure was very low. Bedroom lights are in awkward place if one bedside light is on it also lights up other bed etc. mainly whoever designed the room was not a professional. Only advantage is airport shuttle but overall I would give 5 out of 10. The particular room assigned to us was equivalent of 2 stars but was charged 4star price. Not so good. Service was also disappointing!,Apr 24| 2021,3
I think you property is a little dated. Was upset that I had an iron that had no level knob and that the blow dryer had low blowing power when set on high plus my hair was singed a little due to a power surge on the blow dryer that produced a quick flame. I brought this up to the PM agent but I did not receive a follow up. Even the Night Manager did not even know about it on my departure. I only like the hotel due to the proximity to the airport. Didn’t use the gym due to the 1st come/ serve. Dining was a disappointment due to the impression on your website that that you can sit in the dining room. Wasn’t informed until I came for breakfast and was told that take was only available. I’m more upset that no follow up was given by the staff. That’s why I will not stay or recommend this property to anyone.,Apr 24| 2021,3
Has a member the Hilton Hotel I was very disappointed at this stay: 1. The employee could not find my reservation for half an hour. Instead of asking her coworker for assistance pretty much she wanted me to call Expedia about reservation. 2. The second employee found my reservation with no problem however she forgot to provide my breakfast ticket(which I did not know I had to get).   Very disappointing!,Apr 21| 2021,2
Is a good option to fly from and to JFK| because the shuttle to this airport is every 30 minutes. Also| have a bus stop in front and you can go to the subway station and visit many places in NYC,Apr 21| 2021,5
Our stay here exceeded our expectations. Wanda at the front desk was amazingly helpful| friendly and accommodating| and she made this a pleasant stress free stay. The room was clean| comfortable| and just what we needed.,Apr 18| 2021,5
Close to airport. Convenient location. Easy to get to from JFK.,Apr 14| 2021,1

I loved how the room was clean| a lot of parking| friendly staff| breakfast was included and was good| tv had cable and it was a smoke free and comfortable environment. I will definitely come back to this hotel without a doubt when in the city.,Apr 13| 2021,5
It is a little bit run down.,Apr 12| 2021,4
The gentleman who checked us in was very helpful and accommodating.,Apr 12| 2021,5
The hotel was really nice check in was quick the staff did practice very good social distancing hand sanitizer throughout the hotel etc. However Parking was a nightmare!!!! at the evening hours i had to circle the hotel parking lot and outside around the hotel almost an hour before someone pulled out of space that definitely needs to be addressed it was horrible I was exhausted all i wanted to do was go to my room but you couldn't due to the parking situation.,Apr 11| 2021,4
Even tho they have free parking but it’s never enough so if you come park and take ubers because after hours you’ll be looking for parking for hours ...then they have There shuttle buses block and three parking spots where the guess could have parked so annoying but everyone was nice,Apr 11| 2021,5
Near airport| heater is too loud| not so great neighborhood,Apr 5| 2021,4
The hotels was very dirty. Stain in the blanket| hair in the towel. Ppl hanging out outside the lobby all night. Its is not peaceful at all. With kids donot stay their. Ppl are weird noises. Just don't stay here at all.,Apr 5| 2021,1

Thank you everything was good except your bath top drain was bad when taking shower was not draining super slow asa you finish showering the water reach above 15 inch,Mar 17| 2021,4
Decent room. Clean. They put stickers over the door after a room is sanitized so you know no one else has been there. The main issue was the hvac unit. Incredibly loud to the point it woke us up every time it turned on| every 1-2 hours. I usually sleep through anything - planes| traffic| usual NY city sounds but this woke me up. Turning it off and the room got too hot.,Mar 14| 2021,4
This is a great hotel. I really enjoyed my stay . This was the first hotel I stayed at that parking was free on site . I hope to come back very soon .,Mar 14| 2021,5
It was nice and clean| staff at the front desk wasn’t too attentive to the line for check in but once was helped they were nice and fast,Mar 12| 2021,4
The property is ideally situated for easy access to Airport and highway.,Mar 10| 2021,4
Two of my main thing when I book a hotel are the breakfast and the pool. Which is why I chose this hotel. However| I was disappointed bec. pool is closed. Secondly| the front desk told me breakfast was not included on my reservation. I’m pretty sure it was but I did not contest it at that time. On the day of our check out is the the time I found out breakfast was really included... I was mad bec. I wasted my money for two days..staying in that hotel... lastly the sheets have blood stain on it.. the pillow cases have traces of food stain( I was hoping it’s really food and not something else). Some staff were nice but not all.. housekeeping are nice but they need to do a better job cleaning and changing sheets every after accommodations.,Mar 8| 2021,3
Long wait for the shuttle when I dropped my wife at the airport. Food was okay| take out only.,Mar 1| 2021,4
Customer service was great| the shower needed to be cleaner| there were p#b!c hairs in the shower from previous guests. Also it was a bummer that the TV was not a smart TV| couldn’t cast my Netflix to the TV 😓,Feb 28| 2021,4
I'm writing this review as I really rely on reviews when booking my stays - so a big thank you to all who do so!Having said that| the Hilton JFK Airport is one to avoid. It wasn't horrific| but this chain should know that business travelers expect more than this from a major brand - especially when this location is charging 50% more per night than boutique hotels in downtown NYC. The rooms are so rundown| they're straight out of 1999.  It seems like management is solely focused on squeezing pennies by not investing in any amenities (even the most basic hotels generally provide complimentary coffee!) Despite the fact that this hotel is in the middle of nowhere (the closest restaurant is a 15 minute walk) the only food option available on site was ordering take out from their bar...and I'm talking $17 chicken fingers. The Starbucks in the lobby was closed. They don't offer any kind of complimentary breakfast. My tv was broken. And you have to request a refrigerator. Save yourself some aggravation and disappointment and book somewhere else. PS - I will give a shout out to their front desk staff| shuttle driver| maintenance guy and bartenders| who were uniformly friendly| professional and welcoming.  It just seems like its their management team that needs an upgrade.,Feb 25| 2021,2
The first room we were in had a very noisy heater when it went only. It sounded like a jet plane was taking off on the room. The staff had us moved in a matter of 15 minutes. They were amazing. I would definitely book in there again.,Feb 24| 2021,5
The front desk representative was phenomenal. After that the visit went downhill. The restaurant messed up my order not once| but twice. The food was bland and overpriced which just made it more disappointing. The thermostat was broken so despite being set at 72 degrees the room was 62-64 degrees all night.,Feb 22| 2021,2
I paid for breakfast but didn’t get any .talked to Maneger and he said take it with Expedia,Feb 18| 2021,3
Enjoyed our stay for Valentine’s weekend| the place was clean and comfortable!!,Feb 15| 2021,4
The hotel is very convenient location to JFK and the shuttle system works well.  The rooms are clean and relatively modern.  The lobby restaurant is good for breakfast (take out only due to COVID).  We were happy with the Hilton and the price was reasonable for a superior hotel in NY.,Feb 12| 2021,4
Very COVID clean compliant.Older hotel with super loud heating unit in the room on and off the whole night.Take out food was very average and lukewarm.Very close to JFK with shuttle.,Jan 31| 2021,3
Everything was great with the exception of the heating unit in my room........It was quite noisy| which hampered my sleep time......,Jan 30| 2021,5
I made a complaint with the Hilton hotel corporate office about there nasty room. People smoking weed on the floor I was staying at. People smoking were in there parking lot like really!  The heat made this loud noise all night out of it it was me and a family member. The bedskirt was DIRTY WITH BIG STAINS ON IT AND THE Curtains were also nasty and dirty with all kind of stains. The floor had a BIG CIRCLE OF PEE ON IT. I took pictures of everything! Like they let a animal stay there i was very very very disappointed and would like a refund i also put in a complaint with expedia,Jan 26| 2021,1
I didn't like the fact that there were parking spots available and was blocked off by one of the shuttle buses and I had to park in the street| when I had a rental car.I specifically stayed at your hotel for parking.Otherwise all other was ok,Jan 25| 2021,4
Was a great stay no issues.  From check in to check out.  Very close to airport with convenient shuttle bus.  Good staff and restaurant service.,Jan 22| 2021,5
Was good i enjoy the view in belt parkway highway.,Jan 4| 2021,5
Great stay| clean quiet facility.  Helpful staff,Dec 31| 2020,5
Called hotel for over an hour from my cellAnd phone at pick up jfk center busy the whole time. Finally got through and got hung up on. Front seat check was quick and friendly. Would give that a higher rating if shuttle wasn’t such disaster. (After a 10 hour day you don’t want to wait another hour for someone to answer the phone to get toThe hotel,Dec 19| 2020,3
I liked the room.  cleanliness| cosiness and comfort.  Nice staff.  Good service.  Excellent shuttle drivers.,Dec 14| 2020,5

Check in was fast| easy| and friendly.  Hotel clean and free parking.,Dec 8| 2020,5
Nothing it was horrible The woman at the front desk was very rude and unhelpful worst experience ever,Nov 23| 2020,1
The control of air conditioner did not work in the room.We waited more half an hour until they sent a shuttle to pick us.,Oct 24| 2020,1
The staff were really professional and friendly...,Oct 21| 2020,4
The front desk person during the check in was rude| I felt very unwelcome| the reception was empty but she just tried to “ brush me off”| would not answer my question| not a single smile. The room was very hot and stuffy and the AC was not working| we opened the window but the room faced a very busy street| it was so loud| impossible to sleep.,Oct 19| 2020,2
Spent 5 nights and all we smelt was weed! I complained only to hear "We can't figure out whose doing it on that floor!" Rooms were very noisy in the nights| could hear conversions and the tv from other rooms.,Oct 16| 2020,2
Very convenient to JFK. THe shuttle runs frequently. Staff is pleasant and accommodating.,Oct 11| 2020,5
I checked out within a hour of being there it was filthy,Sep 29| 2020,1

I was put in a handicapped room while I didn’t ask for any. The room was very cold because of the AC| I was freezing,Sep 16| 2020,4
It was amazing| great staff and excellent service.,Sep 6| 2020,5
My stay was very good. The room was clean and the service was excellent,Aug 28| 2020,5
Overall good experience for a night away but I realized they didn’t have substitutes for people who don’t eat pork ( breakfast was included in my reservation).  I also noticed no microwave was included in my room.  Other than that| it was clean| staff friendly and it was pretty quiet.,Aug 24| 2020,4
Website said it had a pool| got there and they said sorry it's closed. I ask about a discount since my kids were going to be disappointed now and the desk clerk said no and ask if I wanted to stay at another hotel? The room was alright but not very clean| sheets had stains on them| just not what I expected from a Hilton.,Aug 21| 2020,2
It was really wonderful staying at the Hilton. I’ll definitely do it again.,Aug 17| 2020,5
Great layover near the airport.,Aug 16| 2020,4
I went to this hotel during the coronavirus and I couldn't have been happier.,Aug 12| 2020,5

Excellent Staff . Very Professional| Courteous| and Accommodating . It was a Pleasure ...,Jul 23| 2020,5
Everything was perfect and organized well clean and set properly,Jul 14| 2020,5
Rooms are outdated--one of the cabinet door had a broken hinge--i had to try to fix it myself--bath area was old and had a funky mild smell of some nasty (eww)--only positive was free parking and breakfast was decent (14.95 tax) and free of road noise.  Pricey hotel even in Covid-19 times (144 tax=168 for a Saturday overnight stay.  Seriously?  This is perfect time to update/renovate your hotel!  I'm sure you got tax payers bailout money!  I wouldn't stay there again.  Next door Hampton Inn is better choice of the two.  Street parking is good if you want to save some money.,Jul 14| 2020,3
What I did like was it was quiet what I didn't like was that I had to go to the front desk to get my room cleaned it was 2 housekeepers on my floor I asked them both if they had my room and they both said no so the next day one of the housekeepers was on my floor I asked did she have my room she said no so I had to go to the front desk to ask to have my room cleaned I checked n that Thursday and I didn't get room service until that Saturday...,Jul 8| 2020,2
Professional | Courteous and Very Accommodating ..!,Jul 3| 2020,5

Accommodations where good as always. Still brought my Lysol. Was surprised the hotel was full,Jun 13| 2020,4
Covid cancelled room service booo. Really enjoy room service when staying at hilton,Jun 7| 2020,4
Excellent service in a difficult time. They’re professionalism was greatly appreciated.,Mar 17| 2020,5
Very okay but too much of Covid 19 scare in New York generally. Overall...great.,Mar 16| 2020,5
everything was great| and I would recommend it to others,Mar 10| 2020,5
Checking was very easy that's what I like the most. What I didn't like was the errors that were done during the checkout process. I'm still waiting for refund of the overcharge of $27.50.,Mar 10| 2020,4
Amazing place to stay.Staff very friendly.,Mar 9| 2020,5
Very helpful| friendly staff.  Held our luggage all day while we were in the city between flights.,Mar 7| 2020,4
Pool is indoors but not open in the winter? Maybe don’t have your main picture the pool that no one can use. Daughter was very disappointed.,Feb 24| 2020,2
Between all of us we had 4 rooms. I noticed that each room had issues with sinks and tubs draining. Other than that| clean| friendly and reliable shuttle service to airport.,Feb 24| 2020,3
Convenient to JFK airport nice services and friendly staff,Feb 15| 2020,5
Great customer service.  No issues with check in process.  Room was spacious and clean.Only issue was that front desk did not ask if I was a Hilton member which I was.Other than that it was a good experience.,Feb 14| 2020,5
The stay was great| but the room we booked was not accurately described in hotels.com app causing us to have to buck sn extra room at the time of check-in. The description ssid that the room accommodates up to 3 children snd that there is a sofa or rollaway bed available.  When we reached the hotel they said none of their rooms have that availability.,Feb 12| 2020,5
Pool closed which is reason it was booked and it’s proximity to airport.,Feb 12| 2020,5
Close to JFK.  Bed was very comfortable .  Shower did not work correctly .,Feb 4| 2020,3
the veiw of JFK was outstanding from my room just what i  wanted try to be back in february,Feb 4| 2020,5
Nice hotel and front desk staff. One dislike was the bathroom shower| very slippery and tight quarters also the shelf in the shower couldn’t hold anything because the design so I would put my toiletries on there and they would Immediately fell on the floor. Valet staff in the morning was not friendly or helpful either,Feb 2| 2020,4
Air conditioner/heating unit was extremely noisy.   Kept us up all night.,Jan 28| 2020,3
The friendliness and professionalism of the staff. Even though they were busy they took time to listen and attend to your needs. I did not like the coldness of the rooms and the constant noise coming from the air vents. This made it difficulty falling asleep and returning back to sleep.,Jan 27| 2020,4
Hi it’s very very bad services first they give me room wrong with 2 queen bed then I call them they change the room to king bed with handicap room Bathroom toilet seat water running all night not stop . no heat in room I call twice they send no one show up . Very bad service never coming there thank you !!!,Jan 23| 2020,1
Friendly and Helpful staff. Airport shuttle to and from airport.,Jan 22| 2020,5
Great rooms great resturant,Jan 20| 2020,5
I didn’t appreciate the $25 valet parking. We chose the Hilton because the previous hotel we stayed a month ago up the st advertised parking but their lot was full and we had to park on the st. (and where we parked a neighbor told us we would’ve been towed). So we stayed this time at Hilton who advertised parking and got hit w $25 for the day.,Jan 20| 2020,4
The heating unit in the room was so loud and vibrating erratically that we were concerned it might explode. Room smelled and they attempted to conceal with air freshener.,Jan 19| 2020,2
Like the professionalism of the staff. They were all nice and willing to help and answer any questions I had. The bus service was also a huge help to the airport.,Jan 13| 2020,5
Hotel was good. The only thing is the $25 dollar a day for parking is a joke !!! And not fair at all.,Jan 11| 2020,4
The location of the hotel was what we needed to late checkin and early departure.   The free facility of the courtesy bus made the transfer easy,Jan 10| 2020,5
Staff is very helpful. Current construction makes access difficult,Jan 9| 2020,5
The airport shuttle service was very efficient and right on time. They even loaded and unloaded all of my luggage. The hotel staff was very friendly and got me checked super fast also explaining all of the amenities available to me. My room was clean| had plenty of linens| and upscale bath tofu Rd.,Jan 9| 2020,5
Front desk staff is very attentive and professional,Jan 9| 2020,5
Clean and good place,Jan 7| 2020,5
I have stayed in hilton hotels all over the world.  Some bigger than others but very exclusive|  well decorated| outstanding restaurants| outstanding food| moderns| etc. I was expecting a better and nicer looking hilton as all should provide similar if not the same services and amenities.  For the price regardless whether it is in NY| I expectedly to see a better and nice looking state of the art property and it was not what I expected.  The food too expensive.  3 oz. of juice for 5$ was extremely expensive.  The Buffett area and the food look like a Days Inn style. Food containers were emptied and needed to ask to fill them in.,Jan 6| 2020,3
Friendliness and shuttle to the airport . Relaxing before next long flight,Jan 5| 2020,5
They give me downgraded room because what I booked for was not available pleads that the next day what I booked for free of charge now they now changed me the room I reserved but not getting it,Jan 1| 2020,1
Clean| comfortable| easy shuttle to airport. Free wifi. Took the local bus to the subway into the city. This was pretty easy. Had to wait about 10 minutes for the bus. the bus drops you off right by the subway entrance. Took the same route back to hotel at about 9 pm. Apparently the bus stop going the opposite direction (back to the hotel) is a three block walk in the dark. Felt a little unsafe as a single female. Would probably take subway to Airtran and then shuttle back to hotel if here again.,Dec 30| 2019,5
It’s rare to find a place near JFK that is spacious.  We always stay in the suit and it is very roomy. They used to have free parking.  Now you have to pay.  We park on the street.  We are disappointed longer offer free parking. Thankfully we have always been able to find a spot on the  street. Also they have them indoor pool. For many years we stayed here in the winter knowing our children could use the pool at anytime. They have started closing it in the winter| which is a disappointment.  Finally| there are no food options in walking distance and the restaurant is pricy.  We always have a refrigerator and microwave so we bring our own breakfast.  But a free or reasonably priced breakfast would be a great improvement.,Dec 30| 2019,4
The food at dinner was terrible. Everything else fine.,Dec 28| 2019,4
The hotel looks good from outside but the room was not made up at all and after calling the front desk they had an issue in getting it cleaned So after a little argument they gave us another room nd such a pain going to another room after driving for 10 hrs.  Never had an issue like this at any Hilton but this time it was really bad,Dec 13| 2019,1
Was difficult figuring out how to get a shuttle from JFK. I don’t travel much and it was confusing at the airport. I got a response from the hotel via Orbitz the next day on how to get to the shuttle. A little too late on that one. Tried calling the hotel 3 times and no one answered so I could ask how to get shuttle. Finally talked to someone in reservations and she helped even though she wasn’t at that hotel. Great food| most employees were very friendly and helpful| comfy bed and pillows| amazing shampoo and conditioner! I wanted to buy some online but you are all sold out 😢Overall a good experience but remember some people don’t travel much and need a little more patience and guidance. Information on how to get to the shuttle and what times they are there should be sent to the customer upon making a reservation. Same thing for departures to the airport. It is VITAL to know they only leave every 30 minutes so customer can plan accordingly. Glad I asked about it the night before.,Dec 9| 2019,3
Nothing special about this airport Hilton. It needs perhaps a re- vamp. Our stay was ok| we had nice cocktails| a decent dinner| a good night rest. We were happy,Dec 5| 2019,3
It had everything i needed during my trip. Food| drink| etc.,Dec 4| 2019,5
Upgraded room very friendly staff listened to my concern,Nov 28| 2019,5
This property had a very helpful and friendly staff including the shuttle drivers.,Nov 27| 2019,4
Had a nice stay. Room was clean. Staff friendly,Nov 25| 2019,5
Very friendly. Great service. Lots of construction,Nov 24| 2019,5
Friendly staff - great shuttle to the airport - very reasonable charge to leave our car while we’re away,Nov 16| 2019,4
Something goes off every 15-20 minutes and makes annoying noise. I am not sure if it was AC that you could also hear| but then it would be followed by this noise that wouldn't let you sleep. They may not have this problem in all rooms. I checked in and left the property with personal business and came back late at night; that's why I didn't want to go through all hassle and move to another room.Their breakfast buffet needs pork substitues like beef or chicken sausage/patties. Although they do have pork substitues listed in the menu| the buffet section had one container with bacon and sausages divided. I am not sure if those sausages were pork substitutes (beef or chicken) but keeping it in same container is a no go. The only reason I've picked this hotel is because it is close to JFK (only 3 miles away.) Before this place I had stayed at Mariott| which was even closer to JFK. I just wanted to try a new place thinking it might be a better experience considering it was a bit higher in price than Mariott. This was the time when higher price didn't mean better experience. At Mariott I didn't have any noise issues in my room and breakfast was better and complimentary. Whereas at Hilton breakfast is not complimentary.If you're lucky enough to get a room that doesn't have any noise problems and you don't care about breakfast because you are planning to have it somewhere else then this place is good overall. Property is clean and staff is friendly. I would rate my experience 3/5,Nov 15| 2019,3
The overall experience was very pleasant.  The typical Hilton standards,Nov 12| 2019,5
Everything one needs is on the property.  Nice Restaurant| bar| Convenient store| business center. The rooms are clean and spacious and they offer a complimentary| reliable airport shuttle.,Nov 11| 2019,5
Speedy staff and clean room - just what I needed for my night.,Nov 10| 2019,5
Nothing unique.  Property needs updating.  Tired and worn.,Nov 9| 2019,3
Nice hotel clean friendly staff ... overall good.,Nov 1| 2019,5
Got the room for a layover before taking a flight to Miami. I didn't really get to sleep in room but it turned out as a great spot to gather in order to catch the next flight.,Oct 31| 2019,4
Nice staff CleanOn time airport shuttle Bed too softNeed earlier coffee service downstairs,Oct 26| 2019,5
The ac was very loud in my room they couldn’t fix it .The food in the restaurant is not good either| I expected more from a Hilton,Oct 24| 2019,2
Def recomend it. Shuttle service is great perfect to kick time on a long layover,Oct 22| 2019,4
I liked that it was very convenient. Room service was fast,Oct 21| 2019,5
Location was close to airport but pretty far from everything in NYC| so have a car handy. The staff are truly the heart of this hotel. They go above and beyond and really try to accommodate you.,Oct 20| 2019,4
The property needs some work| looking old n tired. I stayed at the Hilton in Newark which was far superior then this property n cost less.The hotel shuttle was late| arrived after standing in the rain for half n hour n two calls to hotel.,Oct 18| 2019,3
I think every hotel room should have a microwave .,Oct 15| 2019,3
Noise from elevator was unbelievable terrible.Room looks like a cheap motel.This for USD 300 per night.Worst Hilton in the world,Oct 14| 2019,1
Easy to get to.  Close to airport.  Great staff. Excellent experience.,Oct 13| 2019,5
The staff was very friendly. From the valet| to the shuttle| to house keeping| and room service. All were friendly| and caring. Even the associates running the gift shop that is in the hilton| but not a part of the hilton was very friendly. Everything is nice and clean| very comfortable beds and bedding| nice shampoo| body was| soap| and conditioner. If you call the front desk and ask for more| they do not bring just one more| they bring you quite a bit| enough to meet your needs. The free shuttle to the airport runs 24/7. Every 30 minutes. Its a beautiful hotel in a quiet area. Very nice. I would definitely stay again. We stayed for 9 days| so we were able to stay long enough to be able to give a fair review.,Oct 10| 2019,5
There’s was food and underwear under the beds. Seems like they never cleaned underneath. The bathrooms as well. Finger prints on the Mirrors and dirty carpets. The power outlet in the walls two of them where hanging out of the socket.,Oct 9| 2019,1
The manager said you guys will give me back my money being awake all night with noise,Oct 8| 2019,1
Kept up all night with noise from dodgy pipework. Not impressed... would have slept better in the airport terminal!,Oct 7| 2019,2
It was fine. The rooms are spacious. I would stay there again,Oct 7| 2019,4
hotel was excellent enjoy transportation they provided,Oct 4| 2019,5
Insubstantial pillows and an AC system that was so loud we couldn’t use it while we slept were the standout qualities thAt we experienced. All else was fine.,Sep 30| 2019,3
It was a great stay. Room was clean| service desk were efficient and friendly. Thank you!,Sep 20| 2019,5
When I arrived in New York I called the front desk and asked for a shuttle which was sent immediately. Then when we arrived the front desk clerk was absolutely incredible. She got us checked in and our room was waiting after a long 10hr flight. The staff in the dinning area were very attentive to any requests that we had.,Sep 18| 2019,5
I had to call the front desk to get the sheets changed as soon after I got to the room. The waitress in the dining restaurant was very nice as well as the lady at the front desk when I check in. Overall my only complaint was the sheets needed to be changed,Sep 14| 2019,4
Very clean and friendly staff| great location| awesome service,Sep 14| 2019,5
Staff darling! So friendly and helpful! Room nice!I’d definately stay there again!,Sep 13| 2019,5

Staff friendly .but sheets do not look clean-restaurant,Sep 7| 2019,3
Property was close to airport with a shuttle from the AirTrain. . Bed was comfortable and room was clean. Staff was friendly and the restaurant downstairs was okay (which is good because the negatives are that there are no walkable restaurants or conveniences nearby). There isn’t a nearby MTA station to easily explore the area.,Sep 5| 2019,4
Efficiency at Check-In and Check-Out. This is was much appreciated| specially when you are on transit for few hours between 2 long flights,Sep 5| 2019,5
We always stay ar Hilton Jamaica| JFK Airport.Friendly service minded staff and clean rooms a good restaurant and close to Airport we find this the best option when traveliling thru New York.,Sep 5| 2019,5
Nice,Sep 3| 2019,5
Friendly staff; outdated property; decent breakfast,Sep 3| 2019,4
The rooms and gym equipment are pretty old. Time for an update. But the staff were wonderful and the airport shuttle was perfect!,Sep 2| 2019,4
It was close to many places of interest but a building is being constructed next to it so it is a little inconvenient.,Sep 2| 2019,5
Good propertyBut no bathrobes or minibar in the room,Sep 1| 2019,4
Hilton hotels is the inly hotel I trustClean safe always look like new,Aug 28| 2019,5
Check in was a breeze,Aug 27| 2019,5
Disappointing.For a Hilton the facilities were old and worn.The Honors lounge was dark bare and offerings were horrid.Shuttle dropped us at arrivals instead of departures with 6 cases.For $250 it was a rip.Very depressing.room was ok.,Aug 24| 2019,2
The staff are friendly and helpful. Convenient to JFK via shuttle bus. No issues but hotel could use a refurbishment.,Aug 21| 2019,4
Nice hotel| with clean rooms and close to the airport.  efficient shuttle service to and from the airport,Aug 20| 2019,4
I liked the valet but fro the price of the hotel| for guests it should be included,Aug 19| 2019,4
Free valet parking  prompt check in. Easy access to airport.  Easy access to highways. Reasonable quiet room.  In house restaurant. In house bar.  Easy room service.  Good location to go into the city or out on the island.,Aug 8| 2019,5
Amazing hotel very close to JFK airport| with free airport shuttle every 30 min.,Aug 7| 2019,5
Great hotel for spending one night before travelling through JFK only thing we called to check check in policy as it seemed not clear what was latest check in time with no extra fee and were told from 4 to 8 pm so make sure you make it there within this time frame. There is a parking vallet fee of 25$. We dined in it was nice did not try breakfast at restaurant. We did not use the pool but seemed nice. .,Aug 7| 2019,4
Everything was nice. We did have to leave the pool because of chlorine levels not being up and were asked to come back in an hour we did and the pool was open,Aug 1| 2019,5
The hotel staff are great and location for airport too. However neither myself or my young family were able to get any sleep after arriving at midnight following a long flight. The air conditioning unit was ridiculously loud. Sounded more like an industrial generator. Shame as everything else was good.,Jul 30| 2019,2
Although we were only staying for a total of 5 hours i decided to book the Hilton as we normally have reasonable comfort in the brand's accommodation. Unfortunately this hotel was overpriced| had a room that someone had been smoking in perviously| an air conditioner that had an angry mind of its own and airport shuttle didn't arrive on its designated scheduled time. Had we had the time to complain or relocate we would have. Unfortunate as i normally am an advocate for Hilton.,Jul 24| 2019,1
The service at check in and check out was super friendly.,Jul 24| 2019,4
Amazing | excellent hotel & staff |airport shuttle|clean room,Jul 20| 2019,5
there was something zooming past like an elevator or something| it wasn't annoying or anything just didn't expect it,Jul 19| 2019,5
Only stayed for one night| but was happy with everything.,Jul 17| 2019,4
Darlene in the bar was excellent.  We enjoyed her service. Excellent bartender and a lot of fun to speak with.,Jul 17| 2019,5
Hotel needs a bigger and more extensive convenience store.,Jul 16| 2019,4
The hotel is nice enough. The staff was pleasant. It's well kept overall. I will mention that I read at least a few other reviews that mentioned the loud fan to the HVAC units in the room| and I have to agree - it was crazy loud. But we decided to tough it out.  We were in room 408 and besides the super loud fan| the bathroom door is out of plumb and didn't want to shut. There were also a couple of tiles in the tub that were cracked.  For parking| there was valet parking for $25/night. The lot is literally an open lot right in front of the hotel| so it's convenient| but also seems unnecessary to have valet parking. But it's New York| so I guess I get it. Overall| it was just okay - nothing awful| but I expected more from a Hilton.,Jul 16| 2019,4
Great hotel next to JFK| the free airport shuttle was nice| good pool for the family to relax after a long flight. room itself was good size| comfortable| and with a coffee & tea maker. there is a convenience store for drinks and snacks in lobby. i would stay here again when flying out of JFK.,Jul 15| 2019,5
It was wonderful however there is no laundry facility.,Jul 15| 2019,4
Safet at front desk gave us an upgrade so we could be near our other two friends in separate rooms. Room very clean and beds very comfortable. Only drawback to hotel was no laundry facility| which is advertised on Hotels.com. Lounge on 12th floor amazing. I would have paid to upgrade to access it. Free breakfast| light dinner| and snacks of soda| water| fruit and nespresso machine in between.,Jul 15| 2019,5
The carpets were dirty but overall very comfortable and easy access to jfk airport.,Jul 8| 2019,5
AC is so loud we couldn’t sleep at nightWe had to turn it off and sweat all night. The smell in the room is very bad and moldy|We move to another room but still the same You smell it as soon as you go into the room. Not recommended not a good place to stay.,Jul 6| 2019,1
Very efficient and accommodating front desk good rooms| beds,Jul 6| 2019,5
This is the perfect place to rest between flights or on your way to another adventure. The location is convenient to the airport only. There is really nothing around but residential. We really enjoyed our stay to reenergize in the pool and the executive lounge between Europe and California. Rooms and service were wonderful!!,Jul 5| 2019,5
Suited our requirements completely.  Good bed| ckean room which wad large and great shower.Offered complimentary  breakfast as well,Jun 26| 2019,5
First room I was given has AC fan that was so loud it felt like I was in a wind tunnel| and AC fan could not be turned off. Impossible to stay in the room. Had to switch rooms and still sleep with AC off.,Jun 26| 2019,1
Bad experience for my room. Checked in at 12am and 4am got wakes up by the fire alarm| then water leaking| technician came and fixed till 5:30am. Checked out by 7am with another hour to sleep.,Jun 24| 2019,2
It was fine in a pinch. Appreciated the honors lounge.,Jun 23| 2019,3
Bed sheets were dirty. Looked they were being used again. Pillow cases had marks of saliva.Dirty dirty.,Jun 16| 2019,2
Flight was canceled in Miami.  American Airlines diverted me to JFK for flight to Antigua.  Hilton was very nice. Much better than the hole in wall hotel American gave a voucher for 35 mins from the airport.,Jun 12| 2019,5
Clean spacious. friendly| good bathroom products| complementary water and fruit,Jun 7| 2019,4
We booked our stay at this hotel as we THOUGHT it was the best option at JFK. We arrived at 2:30am exhausted from our flight. The room| 617| had LOUD air fan sounds!  The AC worked fine| but the loud fan noise was the worst!  I literally took a sound video to prove it to the front desk but we had no time to stop as we had to catch our next flight. No one slept! Worst experience ever-terrible start to our trip. The good news is that things can only get better. Booooooooo,Jun 6| 2019,1
The worst hotel I have stayed in ever,May 31| 2019,1
Good facility near airport for short staying| big and clean room| basic restaurant - for 1 night staying is very good.,May 31| 2019,4
The room smelled like mildew or wet carpet | it was too late and we where tired but for future references might want to check that,May 29| 2019,3
The AC wasnt cooling,May 28| 2019,3
Overall service phenomenal. Would not change anything,May 25| 2019,5
We were put in a room facing directly at the construction site. I could literally talk to the workers at my window. It blows my mind that they even tried to give that room to someone. When I complained about the construction the front desk staff said there's no other room and the work will be over around 4pm. Never did| went on and on until 8pm. When I asked another staff she offered room switching but was not pleasant in her tone either.,May 23| 2019,2
I only stayed here overnight due to a layover. I liked the convenience of having a free shuttle to the airport since my flight was very early in the morning. The hotel was very nice and quiet. The only downside is that there aren't any outside restaurants nearby the hotel.,May 23| 2019,4
Excellent location for JFK flight. Shuttles to terminal. Reasonable parking rate.,May 23| 2019,4
Friendly staff| good amenities onsite and clean room . Shuttle service was excellent! Would definitely stay there again.,May 22| 2019,5
Did not like there was no drinking water bottlesvin the room.,May 15| 2019,4
The hotel was overall a great place but our air conditioner wasn’t working and it was 75 degrees in the room. Called down to the service desk they sent no one and my children and I all woke up with stuffy noses and dry throats. For $300 I was not happy with our stay they could of at least changed our room verse ignore the problem.,May 5| 2019,3
First of all| I’m pretty much done using Expedia to book hotels| because if you select a room with a king bed and a bathtub| the hotel will surely give you two queens and a shower| which this one did. So then there is the inevitable trip back down to the lobby to sort that out. Second of all| when we informed the lobby staff at midnight that we had not had dinner because of flight delays| they suggested a food delivery app. That late| three restaurants were open| and the one we selected took 2 hours to deliver a pretty crappy meal to our room. But the reason I bring this up is because the next day| we noticed on the room service menu there was a tiny line explaining there was a late night menu of snacks available. Had the hotel lobby mentioned that| we would have been much happier with that| but they didn’t. We also had to ask if they do PAID late check-out. We had to specify| even explaining our flight didn’t leave till late the next evening| because when we asked if they had late check-out| they are apparently trained to say “we can give you an extra hour” and not tell you if you pay a small fee you can have several extra hours. So if the staff actually thought to volunteer helpful information when asked? We would have spent a lot more money at the hotel. We got late check-out but had to use the word “paid” to get it (I guess they don’t like making more money?) and we ended up having to stay up late just to eat something| when apparently that wasn’t necessary.,May 4| 2019,3
We stay here pretty regularly when flying out of JFK. It’s clean| convenient| the service is awesome and the restaurant is really good.,Apr 19| 2019,5
I expected the room to be more updated with a little bit of luxury.  It was just a regular hotel room.  We could have stayed at a Best Western Motel and there wouldn't have been much difference.  The shuttle driver who took us to the airport was very accommodating and helpful.  Shuttle was on time and got us to our airport terminal on time.,Apr 15| 2019,2
Quick check-in.  Great food at restaurant and open until midnight!,Apr 15| 2019,5
This property Hilton itself has absolutely changed my wife and I forever and our honeymoon disaster around. we cannot thank John and Simone and Brian enough we will forever be staying at Hilton hotels because of this Generosity of the staff!! Thank you,Apr 15| 2019,5
Starting to  look dated. Charges for hotel pickup with shuttle excessive.,Apr 12| 2019,4
Room service and Resturant closed too early. Unable to get a meal when I arrived after midnight!,Apr 7| 2019,5
Proximity to airport| family members and food in restaurant.,Apr 4| 2019,4
Clogged shower drain not a good morning start. Front desk was nice and food ok.,Apr 1| 2019,3
I loved the service. Everyone was very helpful. I had a late check in. The only thing is| I wished there was a walk-in shower.,Mar 29| 2019,5
Hotel is old and needs updates.Maintenance is not great. First room did not have a working toilet.I was upgraded but in the upgraded room the bath was clogged.,Mar 19| 2019,3
Reception area was nice| but the rest of the decor was outdated. That doesn't matter too much| there were a few things wrong with my experience. The heating system was so loud that it woke me up literally every time it kicked on. It sounded like an industrial dryer was next to my head| and ensured that I only got 3 hours of sleep. The door to the bathroom was peeling at the bottom because of dampness| the sink drained incredibly slowly| and it was impossible to shower in anything other than freezing or boiling water. Also| after a long day of traveling| I wanted to get some food. The room service was not worth the money. I paid $66 for terrible| dry mashed potatoes| limp and cold asparagus| a mediocre steak| and a disappointing dessert. I'm not expecting perfection from room service| but I had better food on the plane that day. For the price| at least put something other than dry| bad potatoes in my mashed potatoes.,Mar 16| 2019,2
Very clean. All the staff were very helpful and pleasant.   Very convenient for a overnight before getting on the plane the following day.,Mar 11| 2019,5
Great for overnight stay however old building needs renovation.,Mar 6| 2019,4
Bland typical airport hotel; service was fine| bar food good| bed very comfortable and clean (more importantly). But a bit tired decor| and no character.,Mar 4| 2019,3
The front desk staff and valet were amazing. Their shuttle service to the airport was well organized and convenient.,Mar 3| 2019,5
Very good staff| good facilities but a little bit old property,Feb 27| 2019,4
Got here with excited 6 year old to learn that pool is seasonal. Chose this expensive hotel just for pool. Also| "non-smoking" room = heavily-perfumed smoking room surrounded by smoking rooms. Do not come here with kids or people with allergies or asthma.,Feb 27| 2019,2
Close to airport.  Great staff.  Nice rooms.  Would use again if I was in area.,Feb 25| 2019,4
The convenience of this Hotels proximity to JFK International Airport is the start of its attraction.But it stands out from all the other hotels in the area because of the attitude of the staff... Friendly & helpful| check in was was quick and easy. The restaurant provided good food in a pleasant environment.,Feb 23| 2019,4
Clean and close to airport. Pillows quite firm and not comfortable. Toiletries limited. WiFi easy to access and consistent|,Feb 23| 2019,4
Great hotel very clean and very polite staff only problem I had was the fact that it wasn’t mentioned that the pool is only seasonal,Feb 18| 2019,4
the ac unit was so loud.. especially thatcit turns on and off...very difficult to sleep,Feb 18| 2019,3
Old hotel| staff just tried to finish their shift. Not real friendly or hospitality in this hotel,Feb 16| 2019,3
Overnight between flights.  The shuttle was on time and the drivers were courteous.  Front desk check in was quick and polite.,Feb 14| 2019,5
Room was not so clean . Find pieces of nail on the floor.,Feb 11| 2019,4
The property was very clean| but the room seemed dusty due to the rugs which caused me and my family to continuously sneeze.,Feb 11| 2019,5
Better than we expected - nice big room.  Good gym.,Feb 5| 2019,5
The room was cold and the thermostat was not working properly| it kept blowing cold air into a cold room. Made for a very uncomfortable night. Will not go there again.,Feb 3| 2019,2
It is close to jfk| shuttle is dependable| nice bar with decent food,Feb 2| 2019,4
Nice hotel|clean and close to airport friendly staff. Nice rooms,Feb 2| 2019,4
AC/Fan in room was extremely loud and kept me up all night. I was overnighting for one night only after flying for over 16 hours and was up all night due to noises everytime the AC fan came one. I told the receptionist in the morning and she said sorry to hear that. Was not the response i was expecting.,Jan 31| 2019,2
Nice place to spend a night and get rest between flights,Jan 30| 2019,4
Very good service and very helpful. Clean and pleasant  stay,Jan 29| 2019,5
Excellent stay for a night of layover - highly recommended,Jan 28| 2019,5
I was not happy that the television show in the room did not work correctly!,Jan 27| 2019,3
The room and the seating areas everything was clean,Jan 27| 2019,4
Had to stay by JFK to catch an early plane. At best fair. But that is because there is nothing good near the airport. Yuk,Jan 24| 2019,3
The building looks like it needs a complete refurbishment. Stuck in a time warp. Air con unit in Room very noisy.Lift nearby made high pitched sound.Had an adjoining room which wasn’t requested and meant we could hear everything going on next door.Great staff though.,Jan 22| 2019,2
Hilton Property was excellent Property  from location and facility's prospective | only the service quality was soo poor .,Jan 19| 2019,3
This hotel was close to JFK airport. The staff was helpful and very friendly.,Jan 15| 2019,5
Excellent overnights got experience,Jan 14| 2019,5
There was some smell in the room other than that everything was really good speciall the Valet parking crew service was outstanding,Jan 12| 2019,5
The young lady who checked me in was very kind| helpful and thorough.,Jan 12| 2019,5
Not very good for being a Hilton. Heaters in the room sounds like a plane taking off every time it would kick on| TV reception was all blurry| The tub drain was broken| would like fill the tub| and once it did close it would not stay open again. And finally the property states it has an indoor pool. Well the indoor pool is closed from November until May. At the property they say it’s an indoor/outdoor pool with just glass enclosure around it,Jan 12| 2019,2
The hotel is what it is for a one night stay to catch a plane. It clearly gets hard use.,Jan 7| 2019,4
The lady at the front desk| an African American lady| very professional and knows her job.,Jan 7| 2019,5
Outstanding friendly and attentive staff from shuttle| check-in| restaurant| to house-keeping.,Jan 3| 2019,5
I will stay again....................................,Jan 2| 2019,4
The indoor pool was closed for the season.? Very disappointed 12 year old.,Jan 2| 2019,4
Food was expensive| but good. Pool was closed for renovations but not commincated,Jan 2| 2019,4
It’s a decent airport hotel with a nice view of the airport from the bedroom. Staff were a bit slow in attending to our luggage with the result being that I had to stand outside for quite some time before a bellman attended us & being that it was New Years Eve| it wasn’t exactly warm. The receptionist was wonderful though & proficient & very kindly gave us a $30 voucher for dinner that night at the hotel restaurant as well as 2 vouchers for breakfast the next morning| which were not included in our booking. The rooms were pretty standard but nice & spacious compared to some others we have stayed in. AC in the room was probably the biggest issue in that it was very loud when it turned on & I think it’s safe to assume that the 2 sets of earplugs we found in the room were because of it. I don’t know if other rooms at this establishment are the same but Room 917 was very loud. We also had water leaking into the room on the windowsill which I did report to reception. My last comment on the negative side is that the bath water comes out of the taps quite brown. Overall though| it was still a pleasant experience for a quick| overnight hotel stay. Food & service in the restaurant was very good.,Jan 2| 2019,4
Very quiet and easy access to JFK. I checked out around 4:30 and shuttle buss came quick.,Jan 1| 2019,4
Free Shuttle to JFK was great. In the morning| it was good to see the drivers making the extra effort to get us to JFK by adding more buses when demand is too high.,Jan 1| 2019,5
This was a truly miserable experience. I was told by the front desk that I would be getting second rate treatment since I booked through a third party. Despite being a Hilton Gold member| I was given a room on the third floor. I notice there were ear plugs on the night stand. I though this was related to it being an airport location. Still strange because we were a long way from the runways. It turns out the ear plugs were there because the heating system turned on with a noise level near a jet engine blast. The only way to avoid this was to turn off the heater. It was a very uncomfortable and restless night. This hotel should be imploded. I learned my lesson.,Jan 1| 2019,1
Friendly and helpful staff but rooms whilst clean are very dated and very noisy.,Dec 31| 2018,3
The shower was not running hot water| just only cold water.,Dec 29| 2018,3
Very friendly staff| and good service. Shuttle to airport was frequent with excellent service.Would stay again .,Dec 28| 2018,4
The air conditioning was VERY loud!! Other than that great room| very comfortable| would stay again.,Dec 27| 2018,4
the only problem was a lot of noise in the construction of the side| very loud,Dec 26| 2018,5
This was my 4th or 5th stay at this location.The stay was generally excellent (as always). However| on this particular occasion| there was construction taking place on an adjacent parcel of real estate. Unfortunately| I was awakened by the sounds and vibrations caused by the foundation work that was being undertaken next door. The sensation that was caused was disconcerting. While I understand that Hilton has no control over suchconstruction| I would have appreciated being informed of the possibility of such. I did bring this to the attention of an employee at the front desk. Much to my chagrin| he did not offer any accommodation. His reaction was less than ideal. I do intend to come back.,Dec 25| 2018,4
Wonderful hotel. Professional staff| clean and comfortable. The only problem I encountered was issues with certain cable channels. I called for the issue to be fixed| and they switched the cables which cleared certain channels but others still didn’t work. However| the servicemen stated that the issue was with the cable company. This issue should be addressed promptly due to the amount of money patrons spend daily to stay at the Hilton.,Dec 25| 2018,5
I like this Hilton NY JFK airport hotel because It is good location and quite place for staying,Dec 25| 2018,5
Its was a terrible experience for me. We didnt even stay we had to lodge in another hotel close by. Hampton. It was a sad story and i must get my refund back ....,Dec 24| 2018,1

We live in the city| but stayed one night here to avoid morning traffic to airport.The room was clean and well appointed| although the air conditioner was so loud it drowned out the TV.Was rushed in the cafe by a very abrupt server| but may have been his singular personality.

The Hilton is a very nice hotel| it is clean and everyone is very friendly. The food at restaurant is very good| and Brian the bartender is a great guy! He makes your evening very enjoyable. My only issue would be that we were in our room watching television and the manager came and told us we were being too loud. So I would say the walls are a little thin :),Nov 13| 2018,4
Easy access from airport    Excellent valet    No self park anymore due to loss of their lot to two new big hotels,Nov 13| 2018,5
The check in agent was pleasant and I asked for a room with an airport view which I got. Other than that everything was horrible. The shower let water all over the floor no matter how u aimed the shower head. The restaurant was super busy and I guess that is why the service was horrible. It was so bad that the manager had to take my order after asking me twice if I’ve been helped. The food wasn’t good at all how can you mess up buffalo wings? But they did give you free bottle water. The shuttle was a carnival with way too many people trying to ride. You would think someone would take note of how many people requested a shuttle the night before. So I just took an Uber. Honestly| for the service given | the dated room| etc. Hilton should not be charging a premium. The price for this property should be motel 6. Oh and forget about watching tv| their provider which I expect is dish sucked. Most of the channels didn’t work and those that did were always freezing and reloading.,Nov 6| 2018,2

Great hotel.  Close enough to Jamaica train station. Not much nearby.  Hotel makes upFor lack of dining by their restaurant.  The food was great.,Oct 16| 2018,5
I did not like the fact that the pool was closed at 9pm was very disappointed that my child and I was not able to enjoy the pool after coming back from dinner. It was 845 pm when we got back and the pool was already close,Oct 16| 2018,4
Staff was very helpful and fast with checkin.  Didnt like i had to leave my credit card for incidentals,Oct 15| 2018,5

Good overnight hotel prior to JFK flight. Rooms are a bit dated but service was good and the restaurant was decent.,Oct 14| 2018,4
Nice hotel| right next across from the airport. Restaurant is not worth going to| unless its for drinks only. Quick check-in and check out. Bathroom in our room was on the small side but the room was clean. Had to go to multiple floors to find a vending machine that worked. Overall for the price we paid| it was subpar but for a couple hundred dollars less| it would have been fine.,Oct 12| 2018,3

Decent| older hotel very close to JFK airport. But not too close that you hear the planes. Love having the airport shuttle. Not too far away from a subway (Jamaica Van Wyck station) but must uber/lyft to it as it's about 3-4 miles away. Hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. Hotel was clean| but can tell it needs a renovation soon. Beds are comfortable. Air conditioner is kinda loud| but works. Thankfully tho it didn't keep us up at night.,Oct 10| 2018,4
We needed a room for the night between flights.  The hotel was great!  Had dinner and cocktails in the bar where the food and service were excellent.  Not my first choice if I were there to sightsee| but for what we needed it was perfect.,Oct 9| 2018,5
Staff was friendly and helpful. Room was clean. The toilet ran all night| which was annoying. Have stayed at better Hilton hotels so my expectation was a little higher. The location close to the airport is the best and only reason to stay.,Oct 9| 2018,3
Close to jfk with free airport shuttle every half hour,Oct 8| 2018,5
Good location close to the airport for over nightwear. The property is older so it doesn’t have USB ports etc...,Oct 7| 2018,3
Excellent service. Love the amenities.,Oct 5| 2018,5

AMAZING!!!,Oct 5| 2018,5
It was close to the airport and has a really nice restaurant.,Oct 1| 2018,5
Room excessively hot.    Multiple calls and visits to front desk and no assistance,Sep 27| 2018,1
The hotel shower was clogged and the pool opened at 3pm| which is ridiculous because I booked the hotel for the amenity of a pool.,Sep 24| 2018,2
It's a hotel.  Had good desk staff and room service.  Room itself was a bit dated but stl comfortable.  Good TV change selection.,Sep 23| 2018,4
Pleasent hotel. Excelent ubication. Next to airport.,Sep 22| 2018,5
Needs to be renovatedNew everythingOutdated Bathtub-very old-could not take a bathSmall tvFelt dirty because everything is oldThe van to the airport was terrific and the staff was nice,Sep 19| 2018,2
I like this hotel not only because of the location but because of friendly staff great restaurant | nice clean rooms and the surprise were big when I got a room with broken furniture. It was not the big problem but rather a sign of slopy ness that I did expect| and the fact that the hotel did not know of it made the experience a bit alarming to me.,Sep 18| 2018,4
I used the hotel as I had to overnight close to JFK in order to catch a 07.55am flight.  However| I was pleasantly surprised by the overall quality of the staff| the room and| especially| the food and beverage service.  Dining alone in a busy restaurant was even a please.  The reception staff and the airport shuttle driver were particularly helpful and generous of spirit.   Restored my faith in airport hotels!,Sep 13| 2018,4
The staff is pleasant| friendly and helpful. The rooms and facilities are dated. Not a great bargain for the price.,Sep 12| 2018,5
For a Hilton and the price we were disappointed at the worn out feeling and loud air conditioning.  Service was very good except for the extra long wait for the shuttle.,Sep 11| 2018,3
It was fine for a quick stay to use airport. It was expensive for the dated dingy no frills place it is. Shuttle was very convenient though,Sep 11| 2018,3
Over all the hotel does a good job| lobby| restaurant and there are many guests staying every night. It is a good hotel and it is close to the airport.,Sep 11| 2018,4
The staff was extremely gracious - even when we arrived at 2am - they had the shuttle for us right after we called. The room was comfortable and quiet (considering we were in NY) - We stayed on our trip out of the country and another night when we returned. The second night the rooms AC was extremely noisy - they moved us without a question. Would recommend to all!,Sep 10| 2018,5
Once I got to the hotel| everything was acceptable - pleasant staff at check in| comfortable room (A/C a little noisy)| restaurant on premises. However| I had a very frustrating 45 minute plus wait for the shuttle to the hotel| despite calling - shuttles for other hotels came round twice in the interim. I will try one of the others next time! Shuttle left on time in the morning| by then I had lost confidence so got to airport very early!,Sep 6| 2018,4
We arrived there early in the mourning and The Staff are very helpful.great! It’s nice to be here! Thanks,Sep 6| 2018,5
Airport hotel close to JFK.  It caters to airline passengers overnighting between flights| and all services are designed to satisfy them.,Sep 5| 2018,4
The hotel was great but 25 dollars for parking is crazy,Sep 5| 2018,5
Hotel is very close to JFK| but not in the best neighborhood. I would only use shuttle / lyft to and from this location.,Sep 4| 2018,3
Some staff excellent while others were a bit impatient,Sep 3| 2018,4
The air conditioner was like havind a motor at a construction site running in our room all night. I will never recommend or stay there again. For the amount it cost| the Hilton family should clean it up.,Sep 1| 2018,1
It was our first time stay at Hilton. What a pleasant experience we had. Location was convenient located nearby airport| all the staffs from the front desk to shuttle service staffs are wonderful. We arrived late around 9:30pm. Front desk a lady named Justin helped us to check in. She made checking in so smoothly for family with little ones and elderly. She is the best😊,Sep 1| 2018,5
Location and 24 hr shuttleCleanNice barNice restaurant,Sep 1| 2018,5
Very good hotel| close to the airport| a bus to the airport every 30 minuets.,Aug 29| 2018,4
Something was biting me in the night| I think it was bedbugs,Aug 25| 2018,2
The staff let the Hotel down as not friendly and did not even explain to us on arrival what was available. only 2 drinks of coffee in room but 4 of staying in room. found someone's paper left behind under the bed sheet and water left in the bath. also water in ice bucket after ice had melted from previous peron who stayed in room,Aug 24| 2018,3
Not the nicest,Aug 23| 2018,3
Great hotel with reasonable price| staff was very friendly and helpful. Food in restaurant was so delicious that my daughter said it was probably the best food she had ever tried.,Aug 18| 2018,5
Location from airport which easy to reach by shuttle,Aug 18| 2018,4
Quick overnight stay before early flight out of JFK. Room was fine| no frills| pretty basic. VERY loud air conditioner that kept us awake...sounded like a plane taking off in our room. If I were to stay again| and I'm not certain I would| they'd have to assure me that we would not have this noise issue again...it was torturous.,Aug 17| 2018,3
Convenient to airport| great staff| clean and i have no complaints!,Aug 17| 2018,5
The property was very convenient for the airport and reasonably priced. The shuttle takes you to the terminal you need which makes travel so much quicker| but the shuttle did leave later than scheduled. Not the easiest hotel for traveling into the city| but I would stay there again before a flight.,Aug 15| 2018,4
absolutely fantastic. great and friendly staff. I would definitely stay again,Aug 15| 2018,4
Pool| restaurant| room| everything was great except the air conditioning.  It was off and on all night long| loud| and with a blast of cold air onto the beds followed by a period of being too warm| so couldn't get comfortable with the covers on or off--not much sleep!,Aug 14| 2018,4
Shuttle to JFK was ideal,Aug 14| 2018,5
Location is convenient to JFK.  But otherwise the hotel is very tired| and there is nothing positive that can be said about the lounge| other than that the staff there did at least try hard.  Do not bother upgrading to access the lounge.,Aug 14| 2018,3
Motel was clean and tidy| friendly staff and a good location with easy access to the airport.,Aug 7| 2018,4
Efficiency in handling large groups with lots of luggage,Aug 6| 2018,5
Hotel staff were disinterested|lazy and rude. This from front desk to restaurant to housekeeping. The property itself is old and dated. The HVAC system in the room was so loud that it made it difficult to hear the television|communicate with other people in the same room and/or even sleep. I will never stay at this hotel again.,Aug 4| 2018,2
I had a really nice stay! Room was comfortable and quiet!,Aug 4| 2018,4
Tired run down and smelly.  There is a damp musty smell in the hallways and the room.  The pool light is laying on the deck of the pool with the wire disappearing down into the murky water.,Aug 2| 2018,1
Dated hotel with very noisy aircon which you can’t turn off without an engineer attending. Only stayed one night before my flight - food was average but all in all comfortable enough.,Aug 2| 2018,4
AC and fan were incredibly loud. Bed was comfy though.,Jul 30| 2018,4
Quiet and convenient but very dated. We only stays one nite and it was alright.,Jul 29| 2018,3
Too far from new york city cost me so much money to go to the city and back every day. Not Happy with the hall trip hotels choice,Jul 27| 2018,3
Nice hotel just have a link in the right window corner,Jul 23| 2018,5
Staff was very helpful| we arrived st 3 AM after 4 hour flight delay. They were very compassionate.,Jul 20| 2018,5
Staying close to the airport is important sometimes Transportation to and from the hotel is very important for me This worked ok but could be improved by better information,Jul 16| 2018,4
Do not stay in room 511 is the room from hell. The air conditioner has a terrible noise. Do not get that room ever. The staff and restaurant is okay.,Jul 11| 2018,3
I spent very good time with nice and good hotel.,Jul 8| 2018,5
We took an Uber to the Hilton from JFK. We just needed a place to stay overnight that was close to the car rental company so we could start our trip to the Hamptons the next day. This is a very basic hotel but does the trick. There is a shuttle back and forth but it involved waiting.,Jul 7| 2018,4
Close to expressway| shopping and beaches,Jul 7| 2018,4
Good for an overnight at airport. Close location to airport and shuttle to and from hotel was very prompt| Hotel is older but in good condition. Clean. Bed was a bit old and tired and saggy.,Jul 3| 2018,4
After getting in later than we wanted after flying in and picking up our van at the long term parking| tired| hungry and weary from the trip the front desk checked us in in no time and gave us a menu for a 24HR always open restaurant that delivers to the hotel room for our hungry kids.,Jul 3| 2018,5
Bath towels smelt damp and stale.  Everything else was great.,Jul 3| 2018,5
Very close to the JFK airport.. Very nice hotel.. But we had a BIG situation with the guests next to our room they were fighting all the night | screaming | shouting out loud their problems for almost 2 hours from 3-5 AM and NOBODY resolved this matter . We called 4 times to the front desk without any luck.,Jul 2| 2018,4
Overall good experience at the hotel. The only 2 issues where:1. Pickup at Federal Circle was late| we arrived at 12:45pm and had to wait for the shuttle until 1:30am2. The A/C Unit in the room created a lot of noise inside the roomThe room service was great| as was the cleanliness and comfort of the room.,Jul 2| 2018,4
Like most hotels| it's a tired old building. Everything is overpriced. But airline employees use it for convenience| and so did my wife and I.,Jun 29| 2018,4
Very generic.  Nothing special.  Food is standard fast food.  Disappointing for a Hilton.,Jun 29| 2018,3
We were just completely exhausted| and the check-in and friendliness of the staff of the Hilton was exactly what we needed.  They have a beautiful restaurant for all three meals|We will absolutely return when we come back through NYC in a month.,Jun 29| 2018,5
Very rude staff.  I called from the airport to ask about the shuttle| and when asked if the pick up location was in front of a terminal| was yelled at.  When I asked the girl if she was yelling at me| she hung up on me.Room had a very odd/bad smell.,Jun 27| 2018,2
I had an incredibly lovely stay at this hotel. Staff were super courteous| helped me out with all the little details. I had executive lounge access and I was very impressed by the things offered. Both for afternoon and breakfast. It was top notch and a great view. Amazing staff helping you out with beverages and such.I arrived before 3pm and the room was already ready which really helped me out since I had had a very long travel time. So I got time to relax| enjoy the room and refreshed before taking in lunch at the restaurant. Which was sublime! Tuna poke| I recommend to anyone!The only slight issue I had| was I had taken a swim in the pool at 3 for about an hour. And after dinner I wanted to take another dip to cool off and relax before bed but the lifeguard had left (even though opening hours were posted as being till 9pm). It is a mor thing| I took a bubble bath in my room instead. In the future it would be nice that such things weren’t subject to change. However I appreciate that they wouldn’t let people in without a lifeguard| that says a lot about safety! Which is very important! Overall| fantastic stay.,Jun 27| 2018,5
Arrived late in evening after 23 hour travel day. Staff was just super in finding us a very quiet room. Comfortable bed and nicely appointed room. When we complimented the desk staff the next morning| they also comped our breakfast. Great selection on the breakfast buffet and well prepared. Shuttle driver was also helpful and personable! Would definitely return.,Jun 18| 2018,5

For an airport hotel| it is clean and well maintained. The staff is friendly and tries to do it's best but as airport hotels go| it suffers from the typical burden of constant flow of guests| typically short stay| and because of that service can suffer sometimes. It's not the top Hilton standard but a very good option for one or two night stay between your transit flights.,Jan 9| 2019,3
環境清潔，機場接送方便。,Jan 6| 2019,4
전체적으로 괜찮음. 위치가 공항에서 가까워 밤늦게 도착하거나| 아침 일찍 떠나는 경우의 1박 하기는 매우 괜찮다. 버스 정류장도 가깝다. 다만 예상대로 비행기 소음이 매우 크다. 거의 5분에 한번씩 소음이 난다. 소음에만 익숙해지면 꽤 괜찮을듯..,Jan 3| 2019,4

the app showed "wrong information" about this hotel. Hilton Garden Inn is actually NOT this hotel. It's a hotel across the high way in the another site.  I took on the wrong bus.  Fortunately the Garden Inn help call the Hilton hotel shuttle came to take in.  I first check in room 509| for some reason| it had sound of heavy ventilation sound. At 3am| I couldn't bear it any more. After contacting the counter and confirmed by the hotel engineer for not able to fix| they help move me to a more quiet room in the 6th floor. Thank God!,Dec 20| 2018,3

Friendly staff/ Rooms were clean but just average. Requested city view but had view of what appeared to be a fashion warehouse building. The staff was great and moved us to a higher floor when rooms were available. However still had no city view. The move did get my family all on the same floor. The first two nights we were on 3 different floors.,Jul 14| 2021,4
Paid for view but didn't have the view at all.,Jul 12| 2021,1
I stayed only for one night although i was booked for two nights. I thought i will see the city view as advertised. But i was placed on the 6th floor even though I requested for a higher floor.,Jul 10| 2021,2
Hotel was nice overall and I would come back. Parking garage attached to the hotel is not affiliated and the one they are affiliated with is 1.5 blocks away (advertised on site parking). Staff was friendly and hotel was clean and in a good location. There were no drink vending machines| so come prepared!,Jul 9| 2021,4
The place were very clean| and near to everything.,Jul 8| 2021,5
The hotel wasnt the cleanest| needs to be updated. Also the interior seemed very dark and the carpet looked extremely dirty.,Jun 30| 2021,2
Can't say enough how much we enjoyed our stay at this hotel! It was super clean and very comfy. Staff was courteous and helpful. The Hotel is located on the corner of 33rd and Park Ave. Very quiet and central location to all of Manhattan. Walkable distance to major attractions like the Empire State Building| Bryant Park and Koreatown. Just a short walk to train stations and Grand Central Station. My kids and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will book here for all our future trips to NYC.,Jun 21| 2021,5

The room that was initially given to me had a problem with the toilet. Since I just got in the room and hadn’t settled in yet| I thought I would just head back down to the front desk and request a new room. When I explained to Agnes what the issue was and that I wanted a new room| she stated that there was non need to get a new room| since she would be sending someone from maintenance to fix the toilet issue. I return to my room and waited nearly 10 minutes before I had to call down to see if the gentleman was coming| as I was on a tight time schedule to get ready for an engagement. When the gentleman inspected the toilet (he was very nice) he told me that this would not be a “5 minute job” as Agnes claimed it would be. The gentleman called the front desk to let Agnes know that I would in fact need a new room. So now I had to go BACK DOWNSTAIRS to get the new room and I HAD ORIGINALLY REQUESTED. I do not understand why I had to go back and forth and be further inconvenienced. When I went back down| Agnes would not even acknowledge what had just transpired. Another lady already has a new room available for me. It literally would have taken Agnes less than 5 minutes for her to provide me a new room. My time was wasted for no reason. Really annoying.,Jun 11| 2021,3
The hotel location is excellent. A lot of dining options and subway stations and bus stops are 3 -8 min away. Close to the center but very quiet. However| I do not understand we got an accessible room though I requested a regular room. If I would not mind an accessible room| there were more hotel options we wanted to stay. A reason I picked Hilton Garden Inn Park Ave is there WAS a regular room with 2 beds. I paid for it but did not get it. Also| their receptionist instructed me to request housekeeping when we needed it. We stayed there for 4 nights and I requested only 1 cleaning TWICE but we did not get it. I called and asked them for 3rd time and finally got our room cleaned. They must be shorthanded because of Covid| but it was annoying.,Jun 9| 2021,3
Forgot my wallet in the room only to be told it’s not there.,Jun 8| 2021,3
Great place!,Jun 7| 2021,5
Truly lousy room location within building| under sidewalk shed and looking at outdoor tables. No light and loud in am.  Hotel was not full| I asked.  Should be the absolute last room sold.,Jun 3| 2021,2
Although I went to the front desk every day asking for somebody to clean my room and change the towels | they never went.they are so disorganized in terms of room service and guest simple request. I stay for three nights and never received not even an apology for not cleaning mu room.,Jun 1| 2021,2
The best part of this property is the location. It is just across the street from the subway station| and has lot of restaurants close by. The staff is great and very helpful. However| the rooms and the condition of the furniture / AC etc is quite dated. In my room| the AC was quite noisy| and had to call the AC technician in the middle of night. He did not speak English| just checked whether compressor was running and said in his Russian-English that it is working and left!! The rooms are dated.,May 28| 2021,3

The hotel stay was fine and location was good for us.  But| I booked and paid for a room with a city view.  I did not get that.  We booked two rooms (one with view and one without).  They were right next to one another with same view.  Obviously not a city view for one of them.,May 25| 2021,4
Very nice hotel.,May 18| 2021,5
It was great. The staff was very kind and courteous throughout our entire stay.,May 18| 2021,5
I had an inconvenient with front desk employee| no courtesy at all.Next day another employee fixed the situation.,May 17| 2021,2
A nice hotel in a great location! Close to restaurants| subway| and it’s in walking distance of several landmarks. Although the room was small| (if you’re used to NYC hotel rooms| it wouldn’t phase you) it had everything we needed| and it was clean. I would definitely stay here again!,May 17| 2021,5
The hotel is conveniently located in Midtown. The room was clean| although a little "worn". Like most small NY hotels| the rooms are on the small side but not uncomfortably so| although it seemed unnecessarily cramped by an oversized desk chair which needs to be tucked under the desk in order to get passed to shut the curtains| etc. The bathroom is small| but clean and adequate with enough counter space for a few items. The closet is on the small side as well| something to consider if you have a lot of hanging clothes or heavy coats| but it was sufficient for our needs.As far as outside noise coming in| the room was very quiet but as others have mentioned| the in-room air conditioner was rather loud which woke us up several times a night. The small refrigerator in the room made a very uncomfortable| high pitched noise as well. We asked them to replace it| and if they did (we were out that day) the second one did the same thing so we just turned it off as we weren't using it anyway. We had a room with 2 queen beds| one of which was more comfortable than the other which  probably wouldn't have been a big deal for a few nights| but we were there for 8| so between that and the somewhat noisy AC and the refrigerator| it wore on us a bit by the end of our stay. Everything was still closed due to Covid| so there's no on-site dining of any sort although they do have a nice small store with items for sale to go. Just FYI| the photos we saw of the hotel showed a roof-top restaura,May 11| 2021,3
The enterance key pad wasnt charged which cause a problem getting in the roomfrom returning from evening outing .,May 4| 2021,5
I liked that you need your room key to access building and elevator.  Search for parking before hand.,May 3| 2021,5
It was in the perfect location for our purpose in the city. The room was very clean| great city view and covid guidelines carried out throughout the hotel.,Apr 28| 2021,5
Close to 34 St.| public transportation| dining| and major tourist spots.  This hotel follows COVID-19 protocol| and has polite customer service.  I even got a city view with my room| which was beautiful to look at night.  Only thing that sucked was that their restaurant was closed| but hey| New York is a food hub all over.,Apr 26| 2021,5
Fairly well located. Rooms were small but the price was very good.,Apr 26| 2021,4
Location was very central. Short walk to subway stations and shops.,Apr 19| 2021,5
They did not have a record of my Orbitz reservation.,Apr 13| 2021,1
It was stated that it was a family friendly| however the weed smoke came through the vents.  Then the lobby has a bathroom that is shared by a club on the main floor and that had intoxicated females being take. In an ambulance. Extremely disturbing for my kids to witness as we waited for the elevator,Apr 12| 2021,2
Very nice| clean room| very quiet and with a comfortable bed. The only annoyance was a noisy mini fridge in the room. Otherwise I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel!,Apr 6| 2021,5
Hotel was very clean the staff was pleasant the beds were comfortable and great location,Apr 4| 2021,5
Quick overnight. Room was clean and comfortable. Front desk was really friendly and helpful. Perfect access to subway right across the street. Will definitely stay here again.,Apr 3| 2021,5
The hotel is perfectly located near the places we want to visit. The bed is comfortable. Staff were not friendly,Apr 1| 2021,5
Overall great and fantastic location next to Korea town and Curry Hill. Staff is fantastic - great service.,Mar 12| 2021,5
It was a great hotel. I highly recommend it and would stay again. Off street parking was nearby| but cost almost as much as the hotel.,Mar 8| 2021,5
The staff and location was great.But the occupants before us covered the smoke detector and the room smelled from cigarettes,Mar 5| 2021,3
The hotel staff Ck-in and Ck-out was fantastic!! My Husband encounter a dislikes from one staff..Other then that the stay was pleasant| Hotel a little out dated...Parking is a nightmare..Housekeeping was amazing and fast with sheets and towels on request!! The hotel had spectacular views of Manhattan a night...Refrigerator and microwave was a plus.....Price! was great! for New York..midtown Manhattan.....safety with key..super plus too....⭐️❄️❄️❄️,Feb 28| 2021,4
It was good. The bed sheet could be a little bit cleaner though,Feb 24| 2021,5
Wonderful stay! Staff was incredibly helpful and friendly| quick and efficient!,Feb 12| 2021,5
Friendly front desk staff very helpful. They even moved(upgraded) me to a room with a view because I extended the stay but my room taken.,Jan 13| 2021,5
Very convenient location| close to Empire State| Koreatown| and Bryant Park. Helpful staff. However| I can smell the next room guests smoking cigarettes and weed.,Jan 2| 2021,5
Dark dingy room. Uncomfortable,Dec 18| 2020,2
It was a great stay!!! The room was extremely comfortable and room service/customer service were wonderful!! Would definitely come again!!,Dec 15| 2020,5
The hotel was nice.  Rooms were basic but functional.  There was some food remnants and trash under the bed from the previous guests| and the coffee machine was broken| but I wasn't bothered by that.  In a perfect world they wouldn't charge $75 for a late check-out when the hotel was almost empty because of Covid; but I understand it is policy.  I woud stay again if I needed to be in the area and the price was right.,Dec 11| 2020,4
Everything was nice and clean.  I had no issues with the room.,Oct 19| 2020,4
It was great| very clean and comfy. The staff and view was great and walking distance to all the tourist sites. I’m just sad the cleaning people mistakenly threw away my dirty clothes when they were cleaning the room since it was in a plastic bag.,Oct 3| 2020,5
stayed here one night & couldn’t have asked for better| fast & efficient service! patrick ( I think that was his name?) at the front desk was very kind & made check in and check out a breeze for me & made sure we had what we needed so thank you! definitely would stay again :),Sep 29| 2020,5
Terrible.  AC turms off in the middle of the night.  Do not go here.,Sep 26| 2020,1

It was ok couldn't get into my room. Had to wait till lock got reprogrammed.  Small room. It was nothing to brag about,Sep 4| 2020,3
Room was amazing and clean. Close to time square. Staff was very friendly,Aug 29| 2020,5
My stay was enjoyable but I wish the room had more of a view and natural light. The room was rather small| but it did the job.,Aug 27| 2020,4
Our bathroom door fell off the tracks and fell onto the bed as I was working. Thankfully able to move my computer and didnt hit me. Moved rooms| the new room smelled like cigars. Moved again| this room was fine. Main problem was not everyone was wearing masks| guests checking in had no masks| guests waiting for the elevators| no masks....guests trying to pile onto the elevators. Staff was very pleasant and if it were not Covid| possibly I wouldn't be as bothered  but as the epicenter for the virus| hotels must demand all guests where masks at all times.,Aug 24| 2020,3
The hotel was very clean and spacious| in a perfect area of Manhattan. The staff were very polite. I had a great stay with my wife.,Aug 24| 2020,5
This hotel is awesome| the staff is great. Front desk service is very helpful during this time of COVID-19,Aug 12| 2020,5
The room was clean as usual| however the room was quite small. Even smaller than the room booked prior. The occupants in the next room had a loud disturbance after 9pm| I was not pleased.,Aug 8| 2020,3
I would love to recommend this hotel as everyone and everything was fantastic. However I cannot. The toilet seats are incredibly wide. Making them unusable.,Aug 5| 2020,3
The room was extremely clean. The staff at the front desk was always nice and helpful. The microwave and coffee machine in the room are a plus!!!!My only issue was the loudness of the AC at night but I am a very light sleeper so it was not terrible.  Other than that I loved it and plan on staying there again.,Aug 3| 2020,4
The room was perfect and the staff professional and attentive to any request I made. Great location.,Jul 26| 2020,5
The only thing I hated was the toilet kept getting stopped up,Jul 21| 2020,4
The Hilton Garden Inn is very convenient to NYU hospital and I stayed there during my wife's recent stay.  The hotel is clean and the staff very friendly. The room is not oversized so it can become crowded during the end of the stay when my wife was released. Overall we were very pleased with the hotel and will go back again should the need arise.,Mar 13| 2020,4
Just I don’t like because doesn’t have parking ☹️All of rest have great,Mar 10| 2020,4
Room felt a little dirty compared to what we are used to. The fan in the bathroom didn’t work and neither did the bathtub plug (which we actually use for our toddlers). Lastly| the ice machine on the floor was broken. Other than that| the room was okay| and the employees were friendly.,Mar 9| 2020,3
The hotel was a wonderful oasis from a rainy evening in NYC. Check-in was quick and easy. The room was very comfortable. Nice touches included cookies and coffee in the lobby. Very affordable relative to NYC prices. Would definitely stay there again.,Mar 8| 2020,5
Excelent service| location and staff.At only 2 minutes of subway|literally in front of hotel.,Mar 7| 2020,5

The hotel was convenient| clean| comfortable| and the staff was generally helpful. However| I have one complaint I'm still trying to work out with the staff. At check-out| I requested the desk call a yellow cab for me. I had check prices and times on Uber| Yellow Cab| and other options and asked for Yellow Cab. Instead| the desk person called a limo/black car service| which took the long route and charged $20-25 more than Yellow Cab. I asked before getting in the car if the price was the same as Yellow Cab and that I did not request a car service. The driver said| "yes| it's the same|" but| of course| that was not the truth. I called the front desk to complain and she said they can't call Yellow Cab. I asked why they didn't say this up front. The conversation continues soon....Hopefully with some recompense for this deliberate miscommunication. Obviously| the wait for this particular driver| the long drive| and the connections between the hotel staff and the car company/driver are primary concerns rather than guest satisfaction.,Feb 18| 2020,4
Great location few steps from subway #6 lots of food choices around Great staff,Feb 18| 2020,5
Staff were lovely. Great location. 4 day family get away. Couldn’t have picked a better spot.,Feb 18| 2020,4
Location was great and central to our needs. Everything was in walking distance and everyone was very helpful.,Feb 17| 2020,5
convenient location in manhattan near times square,Feb 15| 2020,3
The rooms are not sound proof. One can hear the people speak in the next room,Feb 10| 2020,3
Value for the Location. Clean room and convenience for the business traveler.,Feb 7| 2020,4
Everything was great.  Perfect location. Great staff.,Feb 4| 2020,5
good location| but the card keys were wonky and didn't read all the time.,Feb 4| 2020,4
The hotel was modern and clean and the location was excellent. The rooms were also larger than I expected with all of the amenities that you could need. Staff were always very friendly and helpful should you need them!,Jan 29| 2020,4
It’s the fourth time that I am coming back to this hotel and I think it says it allGREAT HOTEL,Jan 29| 2020,5
the hotel is really good | the service and the amenities | please check that the hotel dosent have a full city view because all other buildings around are taller | expedia sells the rooms with city view wich we cant have and charge more money | I am so mad and dessapointed about this | even when the manager moved me from floor 16 to 21 still only had a parcial view to some buildings . all I saw was windows from the other buildings across from the street .location is good,Jan 28| 2020,2
Location!The surrounding area seemed like it was constant construction,Jan 28| 2020,5
Liked: Good room| very clean| good breakfest. Everyone very nice and helpful!Didn't like: Small beds. Location is not bad| but could be better. Should have chosen the other Hilton Garden Inn.,Jan 27| 2020,4
The subway is near the hotel for easy travel to main attractions. The Empire State Building is a few minutes from the hotel and it’s an easy walk.,Jan 26| 2020,4
We had no problem with very late check-in| our rooms were clean and well-maintained. The staff were| to a person| helpful and courteous.,Jan 26| 2020,5
Excellent location. Many restaurants nearby. Comfortable bed. Quiet. Very professional staff| except the guy who checked us in. Nice remodeled bathroom. But don’t look too closely at the rest of the room. A little bit beat up. But some people can be pigs and disrespectful of stuff.  And a subway stop literally around the corner But overall| great value. Maybe I got a cheap rate because it was mid January.,Jan 24| 2020,5
Great location; room was quiet and well-appointed and the staff was helpul.,Jan 23| 2020,5
First time using this hotel brand and it was good. Will use them in the future.,Jan 23| 2020,5
Very close to the 33rd street subway. You can| also| easily walk to the Grand Central for more lines. The room was small but comfortable and ware in good condition. Nice glass wall for the window. The lobby is good enough. The region is calm and has some options for breakfast nearby.,Jan 21| 2020,4
First time staying on a Hilton hotel. I have to said that rooms are quiet and clean. Front desk service was excellent. I will use this hotel line again.,Jan 21| 2020,5
The room was freezing.  I never slept in hotel with two pants and sweater.  The heater in the room was working| but it took 5 hours to warm up the room.  I was wondering if I was in a hotel in US or 3rd country...,Jan 18| 2020,2
Location is great| subway stop just steps away. Room and hotel extremely clean. Complimentary cookies and coffee every day at reception.,Jan 13| 2020,5
The room was too small. I was with my daughter| granddaughter 13 and grandson 11 years of age. We had 2 double beds| closet with 6 hangers and the bathroom was so tiny one could only fit.Not meant for a family of four.Very disappointed.,Jan 11| 2020,3
convenient| midtown| professional staff,Jan 10| 2020,5
So I booked 1 king instead of two full. When we got to the room it was 2 full. At that point my husband was too tired to wait for another room. It wasnt necessarily the worst stay ever but I still didnt get what I had paid for (which I believe was pricier than what we got). The staff was nice and accommodating and the place was clean.,Jan 10| 2020,3
The location was excellent.  The downtown number 6 subway is right outside the door!  It was much quieter than other properties and we stayed during a very busy time!  Breakfast was excellent and the mattress was nice and the feather pillows were amazing.  I don't have a single complaint!  We will stay here again on our next visit.,Jan 9| 2020,5
Fabulous. Great location and very restful. Close to the subway and attractions.,Jan 7| 2020,5
Amazing location and staff! Will definitely be staying here again!,Jan 6| 2020,5
Friendly hotel staffs and clean room. Close by Empire State Building.,Jan 5| 2020,5
The hotel and room were very clean.  The room was updated.  The location of the hotel is a little out of the way| but we got a very good price and were very happy with the hotel.,Jan 5| 2020,4
Decent place ok for business trip.  Room was clean. Place is for business travelers or those that want ok location for NYC stay.  It's not amazing hotel by any stretch.  Just the basics .  Staff was pleasant.,Jan 4| 2020,3
Employees very friendly| at check out no hidden fees.,Jan 4| 2020,5
Perfectly located in the middle of everything| this hotel was perfect. Fast internet| comfortable and clean. The hotel shows some wear. Staff is very pleasant and helpful. Rooms have reasonable storage for longer stays  and are well stocked (including fridge and microwave).,Jan 3| 2020,4
Room is kind of small for 3 people. I understand though it's New York down town so I guess that compensates for the size.,Jan 3| 2020,4
It was great,Jan 2| 2020,4
We arrived in the hotel at about 4 pm. I washed up| and to my surprise| the sink would not drain|.or very slowly. I tried to call the front desk| and realized that the cord for the phone was broken| at the clip. I called them up| and I them about the problem| and they said that done within the hour. Since I was leaving| to go out| I said okay. After four hour They fixed the sink but the phone,Jan 1| 2020,4
Staff was very responsive and took care of us! The hotel was in a great location for midtown| right by Koreatown so lots of delicious food nearby.,Dec 31| 2019,5
Good location| clean rooms | not too happy about the $250 dollar charge to my card though when I had no intention of purchasing any extras | I’ve now to wait a week to have money returned to card | it may not even be the same amount due to exchange rate . Totally in necessary and never experienced at any other hotel I’ve stopped at .,Dec 30| 2019,4
I liked the efficient design of the room and bathroom| seemed to be recently updated| though room somewhat small. It was helpful to have the microwave and small refrigerator| but the coffeemaker definitely did not work after several tries. Room was very quiet and pleasant. Staff was excellent. Location allowed walking to many midtown attractions. I will probably stay there again.,Dec 29| 2019,4
Very spacious and clean.Very helpful and courteous staff,Dec 28| 2019,5
Great location| good staff and clean rooms.  Don’t buy the daily breakfast option.  Food was subpar.  Everything else was great,Dec 28| 2019,4
Excellent hotel with convenient location| friendly and efficient staff| comfortable accommodations at a competitive price.,Dec 28| 2019,5
Subway station literally on your doorstep so easy to get anywhere in the city quickly. Hotel clean and room surprisingly spacious for NYC. Didn’t use hotel facilities much as we were out a lot but tea| coffee and cookies were a nice touch each day. Coffee machine| fridge and microwave in room also handy. Usually prefer to stay further downtown but would stay here again for sure.,Dec 27| 2019,5
Great location. Clean. New bathroom. Comfortable bed and pillows. Refrigerator and microwave which we didn't use but was available.,Dec 27| 2019,5
Good|.. reasonable price compare with others hotel|.. keep it that way,Dec 27| 2019,5
Good location central to Mid-Town. Lot's of choices to eat with great coffee shop (Gregory's) right across the street.,Dec 26| 2019,5
Literally across from subway. Very clean. Microwave |fridge| coffee maker a huge plus. Room was so small we had to wait while the other passed| but I’ll stay there again and often.,Dec 26| 2019,4
Close to everything. Excellent breakfast and they had little snacks at the front desk,Dec 23| 2019,4
When we checked in| they said that the “city view” double room we booked didn’t exist. They said that none of their double rooms have views due to a tall building on that side of the hotel and that the website was wrong. OK| fine| nothing they can do about that but at least update the incorrect website so that people know what they’re booking. Housekeeping skipped us the second day so we requested new towels and wash cloths.  We had to call and ask twice before a staff member brought us a stack of literally wadded up towels.  The room was tiny. It looked clean but did not smell fresh.  The location is very convenient. Still| would never choose this hotel again.,Dec 23| 2019,2
Very helpful great location,Dec 23| 2019,5
The room is in need of new compact on the wall| heating and air conditioning unit. We we’re woken up to the on/off fan notices and rattling. The unit really takes up a lot of space.,Dec 22| 2019,4
Conveient| comfortable| very pleasant desk staff,Dec 21| 2019,5
Nice hotel for NYC.Small room| but clean.Housekeeping pounded in door at 8:30am and walked right in while we were sleeping! Not happy about that!!!,Dec 19| 2019,4

Location was great.  Rooms were small| but clean. Very basic| but good for the price  Staff was nice.,Dec 15| 2019,4
I have to say this was one of the best experiences!  The staff was exceptional!!! They went out of their way to help us many| many times!!  They are amazing!!,Dec 9| 2019,5
The check in was quick and easy| the staff was always friendly and efficient| in spite of being small | the room was cozy and clean. We had a nice view of the street with lots of windows. The beds were comfortable and the bed linens were nice. Keurig coffee maker and flat screen tv | desk and one chair in room. Much to our disappointment|  No rollaway bed was available because of room size . But we made out !,Dec 9| 2019,5
IT is a new property . Well appointed. The satff were very helpful in securing our luggage and generally being helpful to us.,Dec 8| 2019,4
Nice small quiet hotel Very cleanConvenient to everything Subway with in walking distance I’ll book again,Dec 3| 2019,5
Overall| we had a very pleasant stay here. The pros: the staff were all wonderful. They were very accommodating| and helpful without any sense of being put out. The coffee (in the morning) and tea & ice water (in the afternoon) is a nice add on for a lobby with very limited space. The rooms are nice enough - our TV was a good size (though never used) and it was nice to have a fridge and microwave| though we also never used them. We needed to switch rooms| and the request was accommodated by Agnes without the slightest sense that I was making anything harder for the staff. We brought down our bags the next morning| and by the next afternoon| we got keys to our room and the staff had already deposited our baggage. Housekeeping was impeccable. The cons: Our first night| we were in a room right next to the elevator| and basically everything was wrong with it. While it was larger than our subsequent room| the air conditioning didn't work (and windows obviously don't open on the 27th floor)| the wallpaper seemed haphazardly painted on| there was a tiny television with a very odd dresser setup| and while I'm fine with a small room| my side of the bed was nearly impossible to get in and out of. I guess I wouldn't know whether those rooms are representative of the whole hotel| but I'd advise not accepting a room ending in "00" - they seem to have different setups. The A/C situation wasn't great throughout the stay| and I just expect decent climate control for the amount paid.,Dec 2| 2019,4
Great place we go back soon,Nov 30| 2019,5
Great location. Clean. Updated. Friendly staff.Room was small but efficient.,Nov 30| 2019,5
Great location. Very friendly and helpful staff. We would definitely visit again.,Nov 30| 2019,5
Stay here whenever I can when we’re in Manhattan. Clean| comfortable| great service.,Nov 28| 2019,5
The location of the property was good.  I chose it to be in proximity to both Grand Central Station and Penn Station| as I had a day trip to New Haven to make from the former and fly out from Newark after taking a train from the latter.  It was reasonably close to Times Square are the Theatre District| but a bit far (for walking at least) from Lincoln Centre concerts.  It was right on a subway line to get to the Metropolitan Museum and other museums| so that was good too.,Nov 26| 2019,4
Great location| clean and decent size rooms for NYC,Nov 18| 2019,4
Very user friendly and clean. Near all in NYC and easily accessible,Nov 18| 2019,5
Nice hotel in great location. The room was nice and a good size too. Unfortunately the plumbing was terrible! While the hotel responded quickly to requests to fix things| a big hotel like that should have better plumbing/water pressure. The heat makes terrible noises too so sleeping was quite difficult. The staff was very nice though and tried to address things quickly.,Nov 17| 2019,2
Very clean if smallish rooms. We had booked two rooms as we were a family of two. One room had a spacious bathroom with an overhead shower and a mobile/ hand held shower.The other room had a very small bathroom with just the overhead shower. Both bathrooms were spotlessly clean though with more than enough towels and toiletries. I had forgotten my toothbrush and this was provided to me upon calling reception. Even though we had booked the rooms days ahead| we were not given rooms high up. We were given rooms on 3rd and 5th floors respectively as such not on the same floor even though I asked them to do this as we were a family and wanted to stay together. The hotel is about a kilometre from Penn station. I'd give the whole experience a 4 out of 5.,Nov 13| 2019,4
Great location! Very clean Very friendly helpful staff,Nov 12| 2019,5
Very friendly and helpful staff.  The rooms were clean and modern. Shopping and restaurants are nearby and within walking distance. The only downturn was that there is no business center where you can print documents. The only way to print is to email it to the hotel and they will print it for you.,Nov 12| 2019,5
It was a good hotel not fancy but fancy with every you need to expend three nights at New York.,Nov 12| 2019,4
Room that we stayed in was really small.Furniture was also very old and looked like it needed upgrade.So for the money that you have to pay to stay in New York we thought they could of done a better job with the updating the room.,Nov 11| 2019,3
We had a great time!,Nov 10| 2019,4
The staff was amazing| and the hotel was so clean!,Nov 4| 2019,5
It was my second time in this hotel| the first time was fine| but this time I didn’t like it| the sheets of the bed didn’t fit properly and bed wasn’t properly done.  Also they didn’t clean up my room| we went out early arrive at two| the room wasn’t made| in our way out half an hour later we told the front desk lady that we need somebody make our room| she told us that the room service is until 5| we arrive at 11 very tired and the room was not made and we didn’t have dry towels neither a proper sheets on the bed.  We chose the hotel because the Hilton brand| but we didn’t feel we were in a Hilton Hotel,Oct 29| 2019,2
Hotel was very clean. comfortable for stay.Staff was very kind.recommend for NY trip,Oct 26| 2019,5
very loud noise starting at 7:00 with street construction after jus 3 hours of sleep. The hotel should have known about schedule construction work on the street early morning and not book rooms on that side . Or| at lest notify  guests .,Oct 24| 2019,2
Small room but very clean! I will take cleanliness over everything else. Thank you|,Oct 23| 2019,5
Great location| friendly staff. Had a fantastic stay in the City. The location can’t be beat. We walked everywhere. The room was very neat and tidy and plenty of space for the three of us.,Oct 21| 2019,5
When we arrived| our room was not ready (we had requested a corner room). We decided to head to the bar for a drink while we waited. The front desk staff immediately brought us drink vouchers| although our room was ready almost immediately after first sips. To really top off the day| the staff signed an anniversary card and delivered with a bottle of prosecco.  We had a wonderful stay.,Oct 7| 2019,5
Everyone here was very friendly and accommodating| everything was clean and ready to go,Oct 5| 2019,5
Average hotel in a good location. The street noise can be disturbing but that comes with the location. Check with hotel directly for competitive prices. It will meet or beat Expedia and other booking company prices and you will get better amenities such as breakfast included.,Sep 29| 2019,3
I brought a group and had 5 rooms. The staff was great| the location was great and overall we had a wonderful stay.,Sep 25| 2019,5
Good location|near Train 6 Station ; right at Two blocks from Madison Square Garden. Nice restaurants and Pubs.Good form in services and cleanliness,Sep 24| 2019,5
This property in central located of everything Friendly staff most helpful very clean.,Sep 18| 2019,5
Very friendly service.  Very clean.  Spectacular location.,Sep 18| 2019,5
Great location! Spent most of my time away from the hotel as a result of exploring the city but the little time I did spend was great.,Sep 17| 2019,4
Nice place to stay. Convenient to subway and other parts of newyork city.,Sep 16| 2019,4
This is very convenient to Mid town and a long walk to Soho. Definitely would stay again and it’s  a bargain for Manhattan.,Sep 9| 2019,5
Excellent check in staff.  Room was very nice.  Breakfast was excellent.,Sep 7| 2019,5
Room was a bit on the small size for two - even in New York - but the staff was polite and professional| room was fresh and clean and price was excellent.  I'd go back in a minute.,Sep 6| 2019,5
Had to go to a meeting to come back right before Noon which was check out| to shower and leave.  I came back to my room  at 11:30 am and it was clear it had been cleaned| I suspected that they thought I had checked out as the furniture was upside down and the fridge was open with towels inside it as it was in process of being cleaned.  Some toiletries and a bottle of water were gone.  I went and explained that I believe they thought I had checked out.  I did not care but they should let the cleaning people know they might need to do the bathroom and look at room again.  The person at the desk then rudely smiles and asks in a condescending tone if I had taken my bags (I only had a backpack for a one night stay and had work computer| so yes I had taken my bag).  She begins a lecture on why it was my fault because I took my bags with me.  I must have missed the part that states check out is at Noon| unless of course you bring your bag with you.  I then asked if since they took the bottle of water that I had gotten from the lobby store if they could at least take that off.  She then proceeds to radio housekeeping to see if they have my bottle of water.  I said I did not want to wait any longer for a bottle of water| so if she was not going take it off fine I was going to go.  She rudely then says again "Sir| I will be checking with housekeeping" to which at that point  I thanked her for horrible service and left.  This person should not be in customer service.  I won't go back!!,Sep 3| 2019,3
The complimentary coffee in the lobby in the morning was appreciated.The parking situation was not explained well and I paid 245$ for parking for two days in a nearby lot.,Sep 3| 2019,4
Location perfect for my work| very convenient. Sometimes too many staff hanging around front desk observing - not too professional| should keep work conversations 'behind the scenes',Sep 3| 2019,3
Hi. the service was good. However| the size of the rooms were extremely small. I requested a good size room. Was expecting a view of the city and not a brick wall of the neighboring building. This was my first time to New York city and was hoping to have a better first experience. Robert Bozzo,Aug 28| 2019,2
The hotel is right next to a subway stop (6) which is very convenient.,Aug 28| 2019,4
Location is perfect and I would prefer lower rates for the room,Aug 28| 2019,4
Booked for daughter to stay at after working at summer camp. Wanted somewhere safe and clean for one night before flying home to UK. She loved it especially shower. She felt safe and was in good area. Cab to JFK expensive though but worth it for her to be in a safe area.,Aug 27| 2019,4
Had to request a different room due to the smell inside. Moved rooms and safe didn’t work| hotel said they had fixed it but it didn’t work. On checkout no one asked how my stay was and couldn’t be bothered to pass the time of day. No questions about Hilton Honours membership of which I am but found the room cheaper vis Hotels.com At $200 a night you expect more.,Aug 27| 2019,2
Hotel located in a quite area and yet it's very close to Times Square and all tourist spot in mid city which is full of people. It's a small building with small rooms but the staff is very accommodating.,Aug 27| 2019,4
liked the spacious room and bathroom. didn't like how outdated the bathroom was.,Aug 26| 2019,4
The sidewalk and curb at the street right outside the hotel was filthy| if the city can't clean it then the hotel should.The hotel's Valet parking was not valet parking| you had to drive down the block to find it. Instead| I parked in the parking garage right next to the hotel| at a less expensive rate than the "valet" parking.We had 2 double beds that filled-up the room and left little space for anything else. At least the room and bathroom were clean. Breakfast was not included as is the case in every other HGI that I've stayed in.Not a good choice for families with young children or grandchildren.As a Hilton Honors member| I expected far better.,Aug 25| 2019,3
Low floor room over the bar was very noisy. Tiny tiny room. Barely any floor space.,Aug 22| 2019,3
It was nice and convenient and a great place to do everything,Aug 21| 2019,5
Hotels location is great and the stay is super nice which isn’t always the case for NYC. The rooms are fine| typical of NYC (small) and it’s a bit noisy but overall I enjoyed it.,Aug 20| 2019,5
I expected a little better since is a Hilton hotel. The room was small but is ok because is located in Manhattan. The room didn’t have iron| iron board| safe| closet| I found this items in all other hotels in USA. The breakfast was too pricey for what they had there. Probably I would stay there again for the location| but next time I would be more prepared.,Aug 20| 2019,3
Good location and priced for the amenities. The room to noisy if you are in a lower floor,Aug 20| 2019,4
Nice clean rooms. The staff is friendly| the lobby is small but nice. Great location| close to everything in Midtown.,Aug 20| 2019,5
The room is small but the bed is comfortable. Good location| very convenient to take a subway and walk to Empire Building and Time Square,Aug 19| 2019,4
My stay was nice. I were originally requested to be at a high floor as I did not want to be near a city noise and I was accommodated with a 17th floor. Unfortunately the year was a leak in my bathroom so I had removed to the 5th floor which is right over a rooftop restaurant or bar. There was some noise but not overwhelming and they close pretty early so did not disturb rest after coming back from sightseeing. The rooms are comfortable but New York City small which is to be expected there was some paint chipping and wallpaper peeling over all the Room was clean. Considering the price and location I would stay again would devilie book a different type of Rome just for space. But overall great experience.,Aug 19| 2019,5
Great location| modern| clean| great price| friendly staff.,Aug 17| 2019,5
Lobby was small.  Rooms ere pleasant.  Wsit times for elevators were acceptable.  The check in and check out were prompt.  The lobby was small however and felt at times fairly crowded.,Aug 14| 2019,4
Hotel is in central location| close to many New York City attractions and restaurants. Service is standard with plenty of towels and comfortable bed. However| the room feels small even though in the description it says 260 ft. Be aware that on weekend nights| the bar below with party going on can be very noisy well into midnight.,Aug 13| 2019,3
The hotel was very clean| and the staff was spot on!  However| we found the location to be extremely loud.,Aug 13| 2019,4
I would recommend this hotel to my best friend. Friendly service| quiet room| great location and reasonable prices. Great breakfast!,Aug 10| 2019,5
We chose this hotel specifically over other hotels| as it advertised valet parking. When we arrived| there was no valet service and we parked on our own. Very disappointing.,Aug 6| 2019,3
The property was close to the subway which made transportation easy.  Morning coffee and midday cookies was welcoming.  Staff was very helpful with directions and guiding us around the city.,Aug 5| 2019,4
convenient midtown location| friendly/helpful staff| nice breakfast| competitive price.,Aug 3| 2019,5
The staff was friendly but seemed young and inexperienced. The noise from the rooftop bar was awful.,Aug 3| 2019,3
For what we wanted to do in the city the location was perfect; the hotel was very clean; ALL of the employees were extremely nice; and housekeeping went above and beyond when we requested something.  We will definitely stay there again knowing that they fit the true meaning of hospitality.,Jul 31| 2019,4
everything was great. cleanliness good| breakfast was awesome. staff very responsive and solve all my issues. : bad things: our room view was horrible. when I look at outside from 6 floor| I just saw very old and nasty view of our old apartment fust in front of us|second issue was about laundry that I have to pay!!!!!! it is not I expected . it has to be free  while booking a room. lobby was small. the rest of Hilton garden inn was great. I enjoyed a lot,Jul 31| 2019,4
Great hotel!  Exceptional breakfast!,Jul 28| 2019,5
Staff was soooo friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The area was perfect. Would definitely stay again.,Jul 27| 2019,5
I was very impressed how nice and helpful the staff was. It is not easy to travel with small children and they really made our stay very pleasant. As for the food| I was disappointment in general| not just your hotel| to see that there were not healthy options to eat. There are people that eat organic| non GMO| gluten| dairy| nut| soy| artificial colors| preservatives free....all which are healthy. You would make such an impression if you started adding healthy options to your menu (organic gluten free oatmeal and/or cereal| organic/no artificial colors juices; even if you start with non GMO items and advertise this decision| I am sure you'll attract more customers/families). I did appreciate one of the staff helped me make some oatmeal I brought with me and also offered some delicious gluten free muffins. I wish they were at least non GMO. As for the rooms| great rooms| great beds| but...it would help if you freshened the carpets with a non toxic disinfectant (such as Seventh Generation).,Jul 22| 2019,4
Excellent loved my stay loved the room and the staff,Jul 22| 2019,4
Perfect location.  Clean.  Great staff.  Thanks will return.,Jul 21| 2019,5
A couple of days in NYC with my daughter. Nice hotel with comfortable beds| good shower and even a safe. Right next to the green Subway line. Several good eating opportunities around. Second time I stay here this year.,Jul 21| 2019,5
Exactly what you would expect. Nicely run Garden Inn in Midtown. Rooms were a little small but that is normal for New York on the older buildings. Staff was competent| friendly and asked to help with the bags. Price was good| we were only there for six or seven hours between flights and a breakfast with family in the city.( It is not close to the airport). We would stay again.,Jul 21| 2019,4
The hotel is clean. Hilton should allow points accumulation thru third party bookings. Also| they should give 2 water bottles daily to Honors members.,Jul 20| 2019,4
The hotel is in a very convenient location and the staff were great.  The WiFi also worked really well.  I didn’t like the lines for the elevators.  There are only 3 elevators and the cleaning crew regularly takes one of them for room cleaning and laundry.  I waited 5 minutes plus for an elevator on several occasions during our stay. There was a lot of construction going outside but the rooms are well insulated from outside noise.  Also| our room was a little dirty| especially in the shower.,Jul 20| 2019,4
Outstanding service and value.  Spacious rooms and bathrooms.,Jul 20| 2019,5
It was great.,Jul 15| 2019,5
Very friendly people at the front desk. The breakfast| in my opinion| was very average. We actually didn’t use the vouchers for 2 of the days in favor of going out to eat. The rooms were comfortable. Noise level was not too bad. Location is great to get around city.,Jul 15| 2019,5
Need  variety on breakfast food,Jul 15| 2019,4
We were given room on 2nd floor with No view.,Jul 15| 2019,2
The property was in a great location| close to everything we wanted to do. Only downside was our water in the room stopped working for a few hours| but it did get fixed and we didn’t have to change rooms.,Jul 14| 2019,4
Hotel is great but rooms are very small.,Jul 13| 2019,4
All good except for a nosey air conditioning unit in the room.,Jul 11| 2019,4
It was fine here. Glad I opened the AC unit as the filter was nasty! Front desk had it replaced immediately. The pillows are terrible. Looks like it might be time for a small renovation.,Jul 9| 2019,3
I like everything except the terrible view in my room facing with very rusty old buildings,Jul 7| 2019,5
Overall was VERY good holtel to stay  i would tell my friends about it,Jul 6| 2019,4
Good value and great locationComplimentary coffee and water in lobby is nice touch,Jul 3| 2019,4
Good place to stay in nyc and breakfast was nice. Good location near midtown and Park ave,Jul 3| 2019,4
Room was clean.  City view was of fire escapes next door.  If you want a view go higher than 6 th floor.  Breakfast was ok.  Location is great for getting around city.,Jun 25| 2019,4
Like the Hotel and staff. Dislike restaurant staff.,Jun 25| 2019,5
Great location| 20 mins. walking distance to Times Square and safe and quiet area| there is a Subway entrance right across the street| no doubt I will book this hotel on my next visit.,Jun 24| 2019,5
It was ok.  Room was way too small.,Jun 22| 2019,3
My reservation was for a king bed and I was told that none was available and was given a small double.,Jun 10| 2019,1
The room was in a state I have never seen before when checking in. All doors open| stools and trash cans were on the bed and desk and refrigerator was wide open. The AC wouldn't go below 75 the entire time I was there.,Jun 9| 2019,3
Great| safe location| great staff. Room a little cosy but expected in NYC.,Jun 8| 2019,5
The staff was always friendly and welcoming and ready to answer any questions we had. The room was kept in top condition.,Jun 6| 2019,5
Great. Hotel was excellent. Staff very polite| food good. Lovely atmosphere,Jun 5| 2019,5
The location was very convenient and the price great| too.,Jun 4| 2019,5
Overall| we had a good stay. Room was smaller than we anticipated| but it was really just a place to sleep. Key cards kept giving us issues and there wasn't a lot of space in general to put anything. Microwave and refrigerator was a plus. You get what you pay for| there are comparable hotels in terms of price around the area that are much more spacious however.  We could have been more comfortable| but service was top tier.,Jun 4| 2019,4
Nice and clean and reasonably priced.,Jun 4| 2019,5
Very nice room ... very clean and well maintained... would recommend for anyone ... will definitely use the Hilton properties for future travel !!,Jun 4| 2019,5
It was an excellent room and the staff was amazing.,Jun 3| 2019,5
Poor service!!!!!,Jun 2| 2019,1
The Hotel Staff were all very helpful!!!,Jun 1| 2019,5
Staff was friendly and efficient.  All very pleasant.  House keeping forgot an item each day| like a towel or a wash cloth or a bath mat or a few cups| but corrected it when a note was left.  In bath| TP holder was broken and overhead light was out.  All minor and no big thing.  I will recommend to friends and family.,May 29| 2019,5
The bathroom was nice sized with a fantastic shower. I wish the tv was bigger. It was the smallest tv i have seen in a hotel for the Hilton brand. Also  the safe didn't work in the room and it was a sound coming from the vent for the ac or the refrigerator not sure but it took some getting used to. Also the bed was squeaky so maybe a wood bed would be better. Overall me and my fiance really enjoyed our stay. The things that could change werent a big deal since we weren't in the room very much.  Thank you Hilton.,May 27| 2019,4
My room was adjacent to the elevator lobby. Annoying elevator movement noise was in the room all the time. Ask for room not adjacent to lift lobby.,May 27| 2019,3
The location is great.  So close to subway and restaurants.  We stayed at #900 and it was a very small room but had everything we needed.,May 25| 2019,5
The room was great| with a nice view| comfortable beds| and a spacious bathroom which was impeccably clean.  Would stay again.,May 24| 2019,4
Great stay at the Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave.  From the initial check in to the final check out| the staff made my Family feel at home.,May 24| 2019,5
Great weekend trip! Vey clean hotel. Great customer service at front desk. Complimentary cookies and coffee/tea. Great location! Would definitely stay again!,May 21| 2019,5
It was Great|went to two twins vs Yankees games,May 7| 2019,5
I enjoyed my stay at the Hilton Garden Inn New York/ Midtown Park Ave.,May 7| 2019,5
Comfortable room. Clean and well located.,May 6| 2019,5
I booked the room for my adult granddaughter to fill a one-night gap between AirBNBs.  It was more than we can usually afford for one night| but very reasonable compared to others in that area.  We were happy that she was safe and comfortable there.  I had 2 occasions to phone the front desk staff| who were both very| very professional and helpful.,May 5| 2019,5
Great location. The only thing I would ask is that they pro-rate the parking beyond 24 hours.,May 3| 2019,4
The air conditioner is loud and will wake you up every time it kicks on. There’s also a weird ticking sound that turns on as well.,Apr 29| 2019,4
Lovely hotel in a nice area for a city trip! Very friendly staff| air conditioner was noisy which I didn’t seem to mind. Would stay here again!,Apr 29| 2019,4
Very okay.  Hotel room very clean| staff very helpful and friendly| location is close to everything walking distance.,Apr 29| 2019,5
Seemed like everything was new and beautiful. Staff constantly laughing| and seemed to love their jobs| but not all seemed too professional but they definately do their job and are very helpful. Rooms appeared super clean| but 1/2 inch of dust on bathroom vent| no fan in bathrooms| and the AC unit filter was solid brown dust and looked like it isn't being changed regularly. Toilet Roll holder was loose| paper falls off. Bed Lamps were loose| wallpaper peeling from bottom| all super minor| but collectively look bad. Our Windows was left open and unlocked. Didn't realize until I could hear every conversation at street level from the 5th floor. Checking closed windows| fixing loose fixtures| etc... seem the back of the house| cleaning and maintenance has got to do better. From a security perspective| their rfid cards to get to each floor is really secure since only 10 room keys can access your floor as opposed to hundreds of people. The reader in the elevator is not as good as the ones on the door. Occasionally| takes a couple of swipes.,Apr 23| 2019,4
The hotel was okay but the room was so small.  The area didn’t have nearly as much in close walking distance that other places I have stayed in NYC does.,Apr 17| 2019,3
The property was fine| liked the location| I was not happy with a party on the rooftop deck just outside my room till 1am| no sleep that night| and had to be up by 6:30 am the next day,Apr 16| 2019,4
Good location; attached restaurant very good; convenient parking.,Apr 16| 2019,5

Amazing,Apr 8| 2019,5
We were celebrating our 24th wedding anniversary. The hotel staff were very nice. The hotel is Beautiful! We will definitely be coming back for another stay.,Apr 8| 2019,5
It was very clean with comfortable beds. Did have difficulty finding the hotel because the property name was difficult to see from the driver seat. If i had another person in the car it wouldn't have been a problem.,Mar 31| 2019,4
Location is very convenient| we like the walking distance places,Mar 26| 2019,5
I liked the location. I liked having to use the key card to get to the floor of our room.,Mar 26| 2019,5
Rooms were great. Bedding and shower was great. Business center was very helpful,Mar 26| 2019,5
Great location| steps away from many nice Korean restaurants. Clean but really tiny room.,Mar 22| 2019,4
The hotel was fine. Very convenient walk from GCT and close to appointment the next day. But the dinner and the breakfast in the hotel restaurant weren't up to the quality of the hotel itself.,Mar 16| 2019,3
It was quiet| clean and location was everything walking distance to timesquare and subways,Mar 16| 2019,4
No even complimentary water for normal guest!,Mar 16| 2019,3

Such a great hotel| clean| super friendly staff| all the amenities I need| I am going to stay here again and again!,Feb 13| 2019,5
Comfortable| front desk wasn’t the friendliest but neither the worst. Everything was clean on the 1st day but the 2nd day towels were not clean and bathroom tissue was not refilled. Great location overall to stay.,Feb 12| 2019,4
Everything.   Great deal for the price . We will definitely be back.,Feb 9| 2019,5

Nice hotel with spacious room. Walking distance to Times Square|  Empire State Building and Metro/Subway stations. Bed was very comfortable and the bathroom had a decent size. We love the shower since it had a sliding door avoiding the water to over flood the bathroom floor.,Jan 15| 2019,4
The Hilton Garden Inns are good solid hotels and great for the money.,Jan 13| 2019,4

We found some used bandages in the sheets of one of the beds when we first checked in. It felt very tight in the room. That said| the staff was great| helpful| professional| and friendly. The location was nice| not too far from the action. Very quiet neighborhood and hotel. We would stay there again.,Dec 30| 2018,4
Smiling| friendly| exceptionally helpful staff.  Clean| well-appointed room.  The fridge and microwave are helpful.  Good Keurig coffeemaker.  The heater unit made a series of small clicking noises after shutting off| as well as the fire sensor flashing occasional lights.  Floor 7| street side is very quiet.  Room with king bed is quite spacious.  Doesn’t have a bath| but a large walk-in shower.  Overall very roomy bathroom.  Room with two double beds is very tight quarters for a family of four.  You have to manually turn TVs on/off| but remote works for everything else.  Any trouble we had was insignificant enough not to have complained.  We really enjoyed the location| walkability to Macy’s| Korea Town| main artery of 34th street and half-block to 6 train.,Dec 29| 2018,5
This hotel is in a great location and the staff is very nice. The elevators are a bit slow - plan accordingly when checking out| etc.,Dec 28| 2018,4
I really think it is time to give up on Hilton and the brand loyalty they try to get through their honors program. I bought the room through Hotels.com| and like in the past| I asked for my HH# to be added to my reservation at check-in. Other Hiltons explained that of course| I couldn't get points for staying there| but I would receive perks| etc like early check-in| higher floors etc. The clerk at check-in told me that was not possible| and would not take my Hilton honors number. It was weird. Her argument was to downplay the perks so I wouldn't be missing anything (?) It should be known that this is a very basic hotel with  a very small lobby. It should have been a red flag that on hotels.com all the pictures presented were of the restaurant next door and their outside bar (must be on a higher floor). Cons: small room with difficulty laying out our two suitcases| tiny TV| weird layout| large bright red stain in the carpet. Bad lightingPros: Doing laundry was a breeze in their machines in the basement. Bed is comfortableI don't understand the fabulous rating. It is a basic hotel in a semi-central location. The only redeeming thing is that I only paid $115/night before taxes. For that it was a bargain. But with the thousands of hotels and hotel chains in NYC to get our business| I'm sad to say I don't have loyalty to Hilton anymore.,Dec 28| 2018,3
Everything went smoothly.  Nice room with a view of the Empire State Building.  No problems.  Nice buffet breakfast| $18| a bit skimpy on the vegetables and fruit.,Dec 27| 2018,5
Super clean hotel! Friendly and tentative staff! Subway is right there. One block to Empire State Building and KTown. Double bed room is a little small for 2 adults and 1 child.,Dec 26| 2018,5
Nice place to get work done...could use more elevators| but overall a good experience.,Dec 23| 2018,4
This is a well-appointed hotel right on the Lexington Avenue green line subway and in the shadow of the Empire State Building. The cookies are good too!,Dec 20| 2018,5
This was a gem in the middle of Midtown.  I loved the décor of the room.  Everything was really nice.  Every place I wanted to go was within a short walking distance.  I plan to stay at this hotel again next time I'm in NY.,Dec 18| 2018,5
Perfect location with excellent staff.,Dec 12| 2018,5
The hotel was nice overall.  Pillows were terrible not soft.  The location was great!  Upgraded to a city view but was disappointed as there really was no city view. So I would not spend the money.  We got a king bed (my daughter and I) but the room was super small.  Would have been better to get the two queen beds instead,Dec 11| 2018,3
The bedroom was really good| the bed was a king size and its great for 2 adults and one infant.,Dec 4| 2018,5
Nice hotel close to major shopping areas| Empire State Building (which was right out our window)| Macy's parade route within 3 blocks and a subway station!  Everyone on staff wanted our stay to be the very best it could possibly be! Clean| caring and close! The motto for this hotel!,Nov 29| 2018,5
Very friendly staff.  Good location close to Macy's and other shopping.,Nov 26| 2018,4
The staff were friendly| professional and overall provided excellent customer service. The room was nice and clean. Great location as well; it was within walking distance of everything and near the subway as well. Would recommend to friends :-),Nov 26| 2018,4
Went for a short getaway after getting married. The hotel location was nice. We told them it was our honeymoon and they gave us a room with a great view and a lovely bottle of champagne. Staff were friendly and hotel required key to use the elevator which was great. What was upsetting was on our second night we woke up at 3 am with a leak in our ceiling. The spot prior had a crappy plaster job done and was painted over with paint on the wallpaper so it was clear they knew about the issue before. We alerted the front desk and were quickly given a key to a new room. They gave a sort of half assed apology and left. No offering to help move our suitcases| nothing. We had to pack up and move everything out of our room to the next floor and didn’t get settled and back to sleep until about 430am. We were exhausted and had to cancel a get together we had planned for later that morning. I would have hoped they would have offered a partial refund for the night or at least a later check out but nothing.,Nov 25| 2018,3
Over all good location| reasonably close to attractions| but more nearby restaurants would have been nice. Friendly staff with clean facilities .,Nov 24| 2018,4
Easy location | easy parking in front to drop off and pickup| staff is friendly| rm clean,Nov 22| 2018,5
The hotel is in fantastic shape. The staff were all very professional and friendly. Rooms were clean and a very good size considering being in NYC. The location was amazing as we were within walking distance (under 30 minutes) to: Grand Central Station| the Empire State Building| the 6 subway line which takes you straight downtown| Time Square| MSG| Broadway| rooftop bars| as well as many other eateries| bars| and cafes.,Nov 20| 2018,5
Great location and very accommodating staff. Room clean and updated,Nov 19| 2018,5
Location was excellent. Hotel room is a little small but ok for one person. Great shower and comfortable bed.,Nov 19| 2018,4
The Hilton was well maintained and the staff was friendly. There were minimal amenities that weren't costly but it was still a great place to stay.,Nov 19| 2018,5
Nice hotel| exceptional location.  Excellent service| functional hotel without being extravagant.,Nov 16| 2018,4
Very friendly staff. Always willing to help. Gave us directions to nearby restaurants and shops.,Nov 16| 2018,5
I love the property| the restaurant/bar is fabulous| and the staff was fantastic. I had a hard time keeping room temp level| and the fans were noisy. Probably my fault. I'm coming back!,Nov 15| 2018,4
We had just came in from a 16 hr flight from China so needless to say we where tired....the lady at tbe front desk| i dont remember her name| but she sounds like she is from Jamaica.....she took great care of us.The cookies where out of this world.,Nov 1| 2018,4
the details are missing. for ex.:pillow were cheap and lumpy. i asked for hard pillows and they just brought more puffy lumpy ones.refrig is room very loud.ac/heat system not great. lights in bathroom fluorescent not great.tv small.remote in my room and my brothers room doesnt work well - they do not give you a channel guide on the remote| so you have to flip through channel after channel,Oct 30| 2018,3
Never being to NY| we assumed Manhattan was a good start.  This hotel was nestled right between Park Ave and Madison Ave which has a TON of food| stores| and close to many other things to do.  Hotel was clean and had friendly staff. I enjoyed my stay at this Hilton and stayed at the Marriott on 40th for the other half of the trip and did not enjoy my stay there.,Oct 27| 2018,5
Beautiful and conveniently located. A bit disappointed with house keeping.  They didn’t show up to clean our room.,Oct 23| 2018,5
Recommended.  Great location and our stays have been consistently very good.,Oct 22| 2018,5
It was great experience.  Staff went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and then some!,Oct 13| 2018,4
The location was very good.  We were placed on the 6th floor| 4 floors above the open air bar the evening of the McGreggor fight.  The bar was very loud until around 12:30 AM or so.  Hilton needs to determine which must be sacrificed| the bar| or the rooms that face the bar.  I am an architect and have never seen anything quite like this.  We arrived at the hotel at 3:10| but our reservation for a two-bed room could not be accommodated without a 40 min delay as they readied a room.   The problem was our son was being married in Brooklyn (a 4:30 PM wedding)... a small affair| but that delay| and a major accident on the highway coming to NYC| made us 10 minutes late for the wedding.  We had called in advance to advise them of the critical nature of the timing| but it was lost on the staff. That being said| the desk attendant did all she could to try to make this bad experience right| gave us free breakfast| but ultimately we were late for the wedding and| upon return| were up until around 1:00 AM| or so| because of the noisy lounge.  Although she was great| a male manager (her superior) looked on totally indifferent to our plight| shrugged his shoulders and said they will need to wait for the room.  We needed the room in order for my wife and daughter to freshen-up before the wedding. Even though the accident-caused traffic delay was not their fault| had the room been ready when we arrived| we would have made the wedding with one-half hour to spare.,Oct 12| 2018,2
The hotel was fine and in a great location. However| the room was small and both the rug and the bed spread had stains on them which was disheartening. The air conditioner worked well| shower was great| bed and sheets were comfy| and the complimentary coffee in the lobby in the morning was delicious.  I wish there had been at least 2 complimentary water bottles in the room.,Oct 9| 2018,4
The a/c unit acted up a bit| and it was difficult to keep the room at a comfortable level.  Also| the elevators were noisy at night (our room was adjacent to the elevator bank),Oct 7| 2018,4
nice hotel. excellent location. just a few minutes walking from the empire state building. the only problem was the air conditioner made noise at night,Oct 2| 2018,4
Pleasant stay. Small room| but all was fine. Very attentive staff.,Oct 1| 2018,4
It was a great location with many restaurants to eat within walking distance. Service was great and the cookies| cold water and cold tea at the lobby was a great detail.,Oct 1| 2018,5
Very small room. Horrible breakfast. Then to be told it was $34 for two. Manager did nothing. It was clean but I’ll never stay there again.,Sep 24| 2018,3
Great location| clean rooms| friendly and helpful staff,Sep 24| 2018,5
The rooms were too small.  There was a clicking noise that we kept hearing in our room| might have been the elevator shaft.  I booked a room with a city view but the view was horrible.  The linens also looked old| I will not be staying at this hotel again.,Sep 24| 2018,3
Overall good.Room seemed small| but clean.Great midtown location| subway stop literally a few steps from front door,Sep 22| 2018,4
The location of this property is fantastic! It is within walking distance of so many places| Penn Station| Time Square| Theater District| Grand Central| etc...We booked two rooms| and they were very clean. Our rooms were on the 5th floor and faced the side street. We were hoping for a higher floor| but they were all booked. Back in April we stayed at another hotel near Grand Central. That room was on the 12th floor| and we heard EVERYTHING all night! This time we were very leery about being even closer to the street level. Surprisingly| the rooms were very quiet. We almost forgot that we were in NYC!The staff was nice and helpful. We will definitely stay here again!,Sep 22| 2018,5
Comfortable| quieter than expected| and very easy to get around many areas.,Sep 21| 2018,4
Smelled great in unit temp was good as you walk in. Urin stains on toilet and side of mattress seemed to have a wine stain upon inspection. Its a good sleep and go place slept like a baby.,Sep 21| 2018,5
Very small rooms slow elevator long walk to time square,Sep 21| 2018,3
Kudos to the friendly and helpful staff and management at this Garden Inn.  My room was super clean| spacious| and had a lovely view of the city. The front desk and manager were very accommodating when I had to make a last minute change to my length of stay due to Hurricane Florence. I will definitely stay here again when I return and would highly recommend to anyone wanting a hotel with great staff| service| and a fantastic location.,Sep 20| 2018,5
Good hotel| clean room| good location,Sep 17| 2018,4
It was my first time in Manhattan| NY. I liked how it had a restaurant/Bar attached to the hotel (Aintsworth) my Girlfriend has an allergy to feathers and when she told the front desk she needed an alternative option they switched it out promptly. Rooms were a little small but whatever. I would stay again. Close to the subway. Check in was fast and smooth. Great first time experience.,Sep 17| 2018,5
Great air conditioning.  Nice gym.  A senior could use it.,Sep 17| 2018,5
Great location|  everything great !Close to metro| to restaurants|  walking distance to broadway to central park| to time square.,Sep 17| 2018,5

This was a last minute family vacation. The hotel was in a great location and very clean. I would stay here again.,Sep 3| 2018,5
Amazing,Sep 1| 2018,5
Thank you! We had a great time in the Big Apple!  Bed was comfy| but not the pillows,Aug 30| 2018,5
I complained about the room being freezing the first day.  I was offed to move to a different room but was informed that all the rooms had the same issue.   I did not sleep well due to the cold. I was told that they were unable to shut off the air.  When I came back from a long day's work| upon opening the door| I found dirty towels strewn in in front of the main door| coffee not replaced| used coffee items put back as if unused. When I said I wanted to find a new hotel| I had to move at 11:45 in the evening and fight to have this awful stay comped only to find out from expedia that it was denied and they charged me for the first night| after the manager went into the computer and then told me I did not owe anything.,Aug 30| 2018,1
Closeness to trains excellent customer service. Rooms were clean and comfortable,Aug 28| 2018,5
It was wonderful!,Aug 13| 2018,5
Excellent staff| good comfortable room| but expensive breakfast.,Aug 13| 2018,4
The beds were very uncomfortable. The staff at check in were very nice.,Aug 8| 2018,4
Very convenient location. So close to Empire State Building. Very clean and comfortable. Would stay again.,Aug 6| 2018,5
Very nice Hotel .staff were very nice and rooms were great.only bad thing is the parking because it is in the city you have to pay for parking and its not cheap at $55 a day.but that is the only thing that was fustrating .,Aug 6| 2018,4
Close to transportation |Empire state and lots of restaurant,Aug 5| 2018,4
Staff were excellent| however the rooms were uncomfortably small and the area didn't feel safe.,Aug 3| 2018,2
Friendly and very helpful  staff at front desk. Fairly clean room and facilities.,Aug 3| 2018,5
Nice hotel. room size is little small but its in center of the town.,Aug 3| 2018,4
Stayed here several times recently but this time the room had a faulty AC.  Would only cool to 74 or 75 then start expelling warm air.....room would get to 79 or 80 I would wake up and reset and the process would start allover again,Aug 2| 2018,2
Hey good,Jul 30| 2018,5
Comfort stay with great location & reasonable price. Slightly too long queue waiting for an elevator.,Jul 28| 2018,4
Close to visitors attractions and public transportation,Jul 28| 2018,5
The staff conducted themselves in a professional and courteous manner. The hotel lobby and room were also clean. My only complaint is that my room had a musty odor that I noticed when I checked in. I assumed the odor was caused by the air conditioning not being on (I visited in July) so I turned it on and left for a few hours. When I returned to the room the smell remained. I called the front desk and informed them that the room had a musty odor. Unfortunately there were no available rooms to move to| but the hotel staff offered to "spray" my room. I didn't want to have any treatments done to the room while I was preparing to turn in for the night so I declined. I'll be sure to complain immediately the next time something like this happens (hopefully it won't). I typically have a good experience when it comes to Hilton| I'm not sure what happened this time|  they usually have odor free rooms :(,Jul 28| 2018,3
I was very happy with my stay here. My room was clean and seemed newly renovated. The staff was very nice. I'll definitely be back if I need to stay in this neighborhood again.,Jul 27| 2018,5
AC weak and room with consistently hot.  Bathroom was not self ventilating which made it very uncomfortable.,Jul 25| 2018,3
Very clean hotel with super friendly staff! We got soaked in the rain so the on-site laundry room was great! Loved the 24hr gym too.,Jul 23| 2018,5
nice hotel in good midtown location. staff was lovely.  room was a little small and coffee/breakfast would have been nice.,Jul 20| 2018,3
An hour prior to check in| I received a call from the desk of the Hilton to advise that my room with a king bed was not available. I panicked. I was in Manhattan with nowhere to stay!  I was advised that I could stay in a non Hilton property in a room with a QUEEN room. We are 2 work colleagues| the size of the bed matters. I told the Hilton employee that I would not tolerate this. Two hours later| I received a call back saying that the problem had been resolved.  When I got to the location| it was on 33rd Street; not on,Jul 20| 2018,5
was great location good size room staff very helpful,Jul 17| 2018,5
Terrible experience not worthy of Hilton hotel line! Front desk staff| with the exception of Ms. Taliac|  managed to disappoint at every turn from checking in (double charged my card on a 5 night stay) to not honoring one hour late check request (approved by one shift and declined on check out day by Mr. Jose). Take your business elsewhere.,Jul 15| 2018,1
Nice midtown location.  Updated furnishing and fixtures.  Very comfortable bed and bedding. Clean room with coffee maker and microwave.,Jul 14| 2018,4
It’s location is close to time square as well as to Lincoln Tunnel.,Jul 14| 2018,4
Our stay was ok. Room was very small but clean & comfortable. I found the front desk staff quite nonchalant. Location is very good,Jul 5| 2018,4
Nice hotel centrally located in mid town. Close to shops and restaurants. Very close to Empire State Building and a 20 minute walk to Times Square. Subway is right at the corner. Complimentary water| iced tea| coffee and cookies in the lobby. Clean facility and friendly staff. Would stay here again.,Jul 5| 2018,4
This hotel works extremely well for us and we try to stay here whenever we’re in the city. Rooms are clean and comfortable and proximity to the 6 train makes getting around easy. Staff always welcoming and friendly.,Jul 4| 2018,5
A little old| but service was good.,Jul 3| 2018,3
The air conditioner did not get the room cold and kept shutting off. When is started back up it made a really loud clicking sound that jolted me awake every time. It was a TERRIBLE night of sleep. Other than that| everything was great.,Jul 2| 2018,2
Weekend stay for sightseeing. Easy walk to Empire State building and right at 6 train. Clean and new room| nice fixtures in bathroom. Ended up walking to/from Penn Station--bit of a hike| seemed too close to take a cab but there isn't an easy subway route. A block away from a decent diner. Friendly and helpful staff. But: I understand it's tradition not to have floor #13| but this hotel had no floor #4| #14| or #24 either. Puzzling.,Jun 26| 2018,5
Hotel was great| very well maintained| nice ice tea daily| not too bad coffee. We didn't like the noisy restaurant| and the poor sound room insulation in street facing room (for those of us that are sound sensitive). We stayed for 6 nights| good location| if possible stay on higher floors.,Jun 25| 2018,4
Room has mini frig| microwave and keurig. Short walk from Penn Station| Macy’s and Korean Town.,Jun 24| 2018,5
1 block away from the subway and bus. Very convenient!,Jun 24| 2018,4
Fast easy checkin. They let us checkin early which made it great to explore with out having to carry our bag. Room great size and beds are nice.,Jun 22| 2018,5
We only had a one-night stay| but it was very comfortable.  The staff was particularly pleasant!  Our only dislike was that we were charged a fee per bag when we requested leaving our bags in their baggage room for a few hours after we had checked out.  We have not experienced such a charge at other hotels.,Jun 18| 2018,5
Room is very small and service is very poor,Jun 18| 2018,2
The location was good and convenient. It was a nice three star hotel.,Jun 16| 2018,4
A home away from home.  Excellent!!!!,Jun 10| 2018,5
It  was fine. Proximity to everything. On my next visit to NYC| i'll seek accommodations here.,Jun 8| 2018,4
Rooms smell like dirty socks| ongoing construction,Jun 7| 2018,2

Would definetly recommend booking this hotel! After a long day of walking and sightseeing all you want to do is get to the hotel and take a nice shower and good rest. Everything is so clean and the staff is great! Plus| the metro stop is across the street.,Jun 1| 2018,5
first time in the big apple| this hotel was in a perfect location to explore. right next to the subway| walking distance to Madison sq garden| and time square. rooms were clean| and updated. Also had a great restaurant and bar attached. close to food and everything needed. Will definitely stay here again.,May 30| 2018,5
This was one of my best experiences at a hotel on the east coast. Miguel| the receptionist allowed us to check in early which my sister (who had flown 20 hours from Asia)| and I (redeye from the West Coast) were grateful for. The hotel is located in the Murray Hill neighborhood between Park and Madison Avenues and within walking distance from Grand central terminal| Flatiron| 5th Avenue| Shopping district. If you're not up to walking and want to take the metro instead| the metro is only a hop| skip and jump away from the hotel. The neighborhood also has excellent restaurants and is very safe. We were given a nice room on the upper floors. NYC hotels are notorious for being noisy but this room had brilliant insulation from noise. The internet was working at all times. The staff - both housekeeping and front desk very warm| friendly| hospitable and every ready to help. The rooms were bright| clean and cool. There were a couple of instances where all 3 elevators were being used by housekeeping staff so wait times were extended but barring that this was a great experience and contributed immensely to making this one memorable vacation. All in all I would not hesitate to return to the Hilton Garden Inn.,May 28| 2018,5
The stay was nice except that the original room was awful. The receptionist was very helpful and we moved to a room with a nice view If it was not for her it would have been bad. The restaurant for breakfast needs much improvement| we went to pain qutidine since it was much nicer| friendlier and much better service.,May 22| 2018,3
While non-descript on the outside| this hotel was classy on the inside. The water feature in the lobby maintained a nice clean smell. Coffee/tea/hot chocolate was available in the mornings and snacks/ice tea in the afternoon. My mom was injured during our stay (not in the hotel) and the staff was very accommodating. Good location| very close to the subway and a stones throw from the Empire State Building. Would stay here again!,May 19| 2018,5
Great place to stay with a central location. Close to all neighborhoods including the broadway shows.,May 15| 2018,5
Great experience.  Checking in was a breeze.  Location perfect. Highly recommended,May 14| 2018,5
Excellent location close to subway and hotel is very clean and comfortable| staff are prompt and courteous. Handy small shop behind reception with snacks and drinks and ready meals. Very convenient all round.Some excellent coffee available within a couple of minutes walk of the hotel - try Caffe Marchio 30 E 30th St.,May 7| 2018,4
The location is great and close to all major points for meetings. It was great coming into the room and finding it comfortable| clean and it feels new. It's small| but it's perfect. The shower is great after a long day of travel and meetings. It was also less of a worry knowing thing had breakfast as of 6am. This way I didn't have to look for a place to eat could come back to my hotel room to work a bit before heading out. This is definitely where I'm staying for future trips.,May 4| 2018,5
This hotel was in a nice location.  Close to various restaurants and the subway.,Apr 24| 2018,5
Nice clean| spacious rooms.  Pleasant staff and informative| would stay again,Apr 24| 2018,5
Clean hotel with nicely appointed lobby. Room was clean and consistently kept each day of our stay.,Apr 22| 2018,5
This Hilton Garden Inn was located in midtown| two blocks from the Empire State Building and within walking distance of Macy’s and Times Square.  The hotel was nice| but the room was very small.  We appreciated that the room was ready when we arrived quite early in the afternoon.  I was surprised that there was so little noise from the street.  My biggest complaint was the charge for parking.  I believe a rate of $65 a day was quoted.  When we checked in| we were charged $80 per day since the vehicle was “oversized.”  It is a Honda Accord!!  I felt this was a poor business practice| since once you have paid for your room and arrived at the hotel| what are your other parking options?,Apr 19| 2018,4
Great hotel. Very clean and quiet on 9th floor.Small room but very comfortable. Great A/C! Good location for NYC. Nice restaurant & bar downstairs,Apr 15| 2018,4
The staff was great and the room was clean. When I booked the room| the booking denoted it was a suite but there is no way that room was a suite because it was very small.,Apr 9| 2018,4
The room was / is clostraphobically small and had a putrid smell the entire time. Dirty disgusting carpet + Sick drain in shower and hand basin. The view was disgusting and looked out over a garbage dump. Worst outlook  I have ever experienced in NYC. From the arrival in the lobby| which probably has the original carpet| and was FILTHY| the hotel should be condemned.  However| the bathroom| apart from the disgusting smell| was quite nice and seemed to have NO connection or resemblance to the rest of the room or hotel. Look for something else| anything else!,Apr 7| 2018,1
great stay| very clean hotel & convient location! staff was very nice & helpful. i would recommend this hotel.,Apr 4| 2018,5
Arrived at the hotel in the early morning and check-in time was at 3pm. Asked if we can check in early and the receptionist told us we can but for additional charge which we didn't mind. The room was on the second floor so it did not have any view of the city. The view was of the back of old apartment buildings. Need to have better cleanliness - found hair on the one of the towels. Overall| the hotel was okay but would prefer a higher floor.,Apr 1| 2018,3
Decent hotel| just don't expect to be wowed. Decent bed decent shower decent customers service.,Mar 31| 2018,4
In town for business so only stayed one night but the staff was friendly and hailed a cab for me.,Mar 26| 2018,4
Friendly welcome at reception| room was bigger than expected| clean with modern decor. Excellent location for midtown New York,Mar 25| 2018,5
Friendly staff| they forgot to leave us any towels on the second day| but other than that it was fine. Close to Broadway and all the shops.,Mar 20| 2018,3
Nice hotel. Good touch w the drink happy hour of waters and tea w cookies.,Mar 16| 2018,5
Hotel room was clean| shower water pressure was great and so was the room heater.   The negatives are the double beds are more like twin beds and the closet is extremely small even for NY standards. We enjoyed the lemon water they provided in the evening along with some type of tea we didn’t taste. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful.,Mar 14| 2018,4
Check in was super easy| room was very clean and comfortable....great mid town location...i will definitely stay there again...,Mar 12| 2018,5
Nice hotel and the price was right. Not too far fro Grand central,Mar 11| 2018,5
Great business hotel in a very convenient location.,Mar 7| 2018,5
The hotel is perfectly located in the mid town of the city. It is a 5min walk to the Empire State Building and a 20min walk to Times square.We drove in from Toronto and parked at Champion parking next door on the advice of the hotel staff as the hotel parking is a couple of blocks away. The hotel room was very clean and modern. We were three of us in a room and it was spacious enough for us. The beds were really comfortable and much needed after a long day of sightseeing. The room was equipped with a refrigerator| microwave| coffee machine and iron. We only used the coffee machine. There are a number of restaurants for all tastes just a quick walk away. I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a comfortable stay at a decent price.,Mar 6| 2018,5
Very good value for the location we needed.  Clean rooms| friendly staff.,Mar 6| 2018,4
I didn't care about the location...which is at 45E 33rd Street & Park Avenue| New York|NYThe reception staff was correct| specially a young lady by the name of karla who did her best to make me feel that staying at the Hilton Garden Inn wasn't so bad.I booked a one night stay at travelocity.com| and chose the deluxe room option at a pretty high rate. But to my disbelief| the room we were assigned to| had nothing to do with the images posted on your website. It was a room so small that my wife and I could barely walk past each other inside .,Mar 5| 2018,2
A wonderful two night stay. The staff was wonderful. Location was great and rooms were very clean.,Mar 5| 2018,5
Fan was not working in the bathroom so we had to leave the door open during showering to reduce mirror fogging.,Mar 1| 2018,5
Although MTA trains tend to suck. The hotel location is convenient for going into the city. Not too far from bars/restaurants. And for the price of the hotel and to be by park Ave definitely a deal. When I first walked in| however| it had a vacuum-like smell. Otherwise decent room size for a city hotel. Worth the money!,Feb 26| 2018,4
We arrived a bit earlier than expected| the staff was very nice and courteous. We were able to check in by 12pm. The hotel is clean and comfortable| although the rooms are a little small. We had a very nice view of the city and everything we wanted to do was within walking distance. Right around the corner from the Empire State bldg. and there are tons of restaurants very close by. Great experience overall.,Feb 26| 2018,4
The location was great| close enough to walk to Timesquare. The room was clean and comfortable.,Feb 24| 2018,5
It was great,Feb 23| 2018,5
This is my 2nd stay. great location. 2 subway entrances located within feet of the hotel. Staff is excellent|  friendly and accommodating. Room is spacious and clean. I will definitely stay here again.,Feb 22| 2018,5
Very solid NYC hotel. Staff was notably warm and friendly.,Feb 21| 2018,4
Hotel is very uncomfortable and extremely small| from the lobby all the way to the rooms.  You pay only for location.,Feb 21| 2018,3
Our trip was fantastic| the hotel was in a perfect spot and was very clean.,Feb 20| 2018,5
We stayed over the weekend and from the minute we walked in the experience was amazing. Very convenient location| access to subway around the corner. Walking distance to all the main sites in Manhattan. Will be staying there again. Thank you.,Feb 13| 2018,5
Our room was in perfect order. The bed was so very comfortable for me and my wife. The television worked fine. The bathroom and the shower within it was beautiful and immaculate. I look forward to staying there as one of my son's lives on Park Avenue 2 blocks away and we prefer to stay overnight at a hotel| your hotel. In the recent past we stayed at the 206 East 52rd street Hilton Garden Inn| a block from MSKH chemotherapy center on 53rd street| and we loved the Hilton Inn each of the 5 times we were there overnight..,Feb 12| 2018,5
Great location. Empire State Building 3 blocksaway. Subway stop at corner. Plenty of places to eat,Jan 30| 2018,5
Always appreciate the good coffee| comfortable beds| and updated rooms,Jan 26| 2018,5
Front desk associates were super helpful with all my questions on how to get around in New York. There is a really nice bar called The Ainsworth that is attached to the hotel by a door behind the front desk that had a great wine sangria drink. The bar got real packed at night so it looked like its the place to go to at night! Great stay.,Jan 23| 2018,5
Everything was perfect. Great location. Room is nice| clean| and spacious (for nyc standard| that is).  Easy to check-in and check-out. Would definitely stay again.,Jan 21| 2018,5

Great location| front desk personnel was excellent| room was very modern. Parking garage right next door| very convenient.,Dec 26| 2017,5
great hotel| clean| quiet (even though we were on 2nd floor)| quick lifts (rarely waited for more that a couple of mins)| perfect location to explore new york|  Great diners near by (Murray Hill Diner for breakfast).  Reception staff more that happy to provide advice and guidance.  Coffee machine| microwave and fridge in room which is really useful.  Mentioned it was our anniversary a few hours before we arrived and a lovely gift was there waiting for us.  Coffee / water / cookies in the lobby - all in all a top hotel stay!,Dec 25| 2017,5
Wonderful property to stay and relax. Staff was very courteous and helpful. Walking distance to many attractions in the town. Really had a four day fun stay.,Dec 23| 2017,4
Great location off Park Ave - walkable to midtown area / Grand Central / Empire State Building| and located right off the 6 train 33rd street station| which makes for a short ride to downtown. (And there's a Gregorys coffee right across the road| which is a pro in my book!) King size bed filled the room| but still had all the amenities (refrigerator| nice shower| comfy bed| TV| desk| closet| dresser| etc.). Great locale and nice hotel.,Dec 21| 2017,5
The staff were very helpful. The rooms were small. Lower floors are noisy and there is also noise coming from the heating system. The location is OK| but nothing much around there. I didn't have much choice because I didn't book early enough. Not worth the almost $400 per night.,Dec 4| 2017,4
This hotel was very nice. The staff was awesome| very clean| great location and prices so reasonable. We would stay here again!,Dec 3| 2017,5
Execellent stay! was only for one night but it was comfortable| easy & convienent. Would Recommend,Nov 28| 2017,4
The hotel is conveniently located just nine blocks south of Grand Central Station and just a few blocks west of the Empire State Building.The room was a typical size for New York City| where real estate is at a premium.  The bed was comfortable| but the toilet paper was scratchy and cheap| and the room was not able to be sufficiently darkened to sleep late in a city that never sleeps.  I also had difficulty getting cell phone reception in our interior room on the third floor| and occasionally some of the cable channels were unviewable due to a poor signal. There was a station with coffee and tea in the morning and iced tea and lemon flavored water in the afternoon/evening| however the stations were often empty of the things I was looking for: Hot water| green tea| or the lemon water.,Nov 28| 2017,4
We stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn as it was near NYU School of Medicine| where our son was interviewing.  Rooms were not very large| but were comfortable and had lots of towels and sundries.  The rooms were quiet and we got a good night sleep.  Very nice pillows!,Nov 26| 2017,4
The only downfall of this hotel is the noise coming from the night club that is attached. We were on the fifth floor and could still hear it. Hotel staff was incredibly friendly and helpful! Nice coffee shop conveniently located across the street and steps away from the subway and Empire State Building.,Nov 18| 2017,4
Bed was old and mattress had two person shaped dents in it| making it somewhat uncomfortable to sleep.  Otherwise| some basic wear and tear on the room but more or less consistent with expectations at this price point and location.,Nov 16| 2017,3
Room was nice| but there is a subway underneath so you can hear a train going by constantly. Try to request a room high up,Nov 14| 2017,4
Great hotel| rooms are on the smaller side but cozy enough. Great staff and the location is perfect! Walking distance to everything....very helpful staff.,Nov 14| 2017,5
Everything was fine except issues with air conditioning/heating. The good thing that we were moved to another room shortly after this issue arose.,Nov 14| 2017,5
The best shower ever in any hotel. Very efficient room lay out. Excellent front desk service. Very friendly manager Jon. Great amenities Free coffee tea cookies all day in the lobby. Will nake it my placevto stay in NYC from now onfir sure,Nov 7| 2017,5
really enjoyed our stay here - we had a twin room (2 double beds) which was a bit of a tight squeeze| but we didn't mind as we weren't spending a lot of time in the room. The beds were comfortable with quality bedding| and serviced to a high standard each day. walking distance to lots of major sights and right by a subway station. I'd definitely stay here again - great value.,Nov 7| 2017,4
Front desk staff and hotel staff were great. Room was a bit noisy. Restaurant was awful service for breakfast.,Oct 31| 2017,3
Steps from subway; clean; large room for New York (normal for anywhere else); room has Coffeemaker (also rare in New York),Oct 28| 2017,4
Room was small but well equipped; if you want quiet| ask for a room not above the bar next to the hotel—very lively! Staff was fantastic.  Only complaint was the HVAC which cycled on and off and was noisy.,Oct 20| 2017,5
Me gusto que todo me quedaba cerca| lo que no me gusto es que el cuarto estaba un poco chico para mi gusto.,Aug 2| 2021,4

立地は地下鉄の前で、空港バスも泊まるグランドセントラル駅からも近いので便利でした。とはいえ重いスーツケースですと徒歩でいくのはちょっと辛いかもしれません。ヒーターの音がとても大きいので、夜つけながらはきになるかもしれませんが、真冬はつけても寒いくらいなので迷いどころでした。あたたかい恰好を用意することをおすすめします。朝ごはんはあまり充実していません。脂っこいですね…,Feb 17| 2020,4

주차안내가 제대로 안되어있어서 호텔옆에 다른곳에 했어요룸에서 이상한 냄새가 나서 별로였음~창밖은 넘 답답했음직원들은 친절했고 조식은 종류는 별로 어뵤었지민 깔끔했음위치는 미드티운이라서 양똑으로 대중교통을 이용해야했다,Dec 27| 2019,3

Sehe zentral gelegen. Alles leicht zu erreichen (Mall| Subway| etc.)Aber keine Fenster im Zimmer!! Klima war defekt. Wir stellten diese auf 21 Grad ein| nach 10 Minuten ging es von alleine auf 26 Grad| sodass man kaum Luft mehr bekommen hat.,Dec 6| 2019,4
오후3시 이전에 체크인 해주셔서 감사했습니다.직원 모두 친절하고| 아침&저녁마다 투숙객을 위한 쿠키와 음료가 로비에 준비되어있어 좋았습니다.위치 및 방음| 호텔 객실 시설도 좋았으나. 하우스키핑 할 시간이라고 계속 문을 두드려서 빨리나가라는 거 같아서 부담스러웠습니다.이거 빼곤 다 좋아서 다음 뉴욕 방문 시| 또 이용할 계획입니다.,Dec 5| 2019,5
地下鉄の32thSt駅のそばでアクセスが非常に良いです。部屋もそれなりにきれいで，フロントでコーヒーや紅茶のフリーサービスがあったり，ビジネスセンターでプリントアウトもフリーでできるのも良いです。ただ，バスルームの清掃が少し雑なので，ここを改めてもらえれば文句なしです。,Dec 3| 2019,5

엠파이어스테이츠 빌딩과 코리안타운은 물론 타임스퀘어까지 도보로 이용가능하고 지하철과도 굉장히 가까워서 위치는 정말 훌륭하였습니다. 룸은 다소 작았지만 뉴욕 호텔중에선 신축답게 깨끗했으며 조식은 힐튼가든인 기본 조식수준 (딱 먹을만한 것들만 간단하게 있는 스타일) 이었으나 과일도 나름 나와서 괜찮았습니다. 웰컴 아이스티와 쿠키도 맛있었고 애들도 좋아했어요.한가지 단점이라고 한다면 주차인데.. 이 호텔 입구 바로 오른쪽 주차장에 대었더니 거긴 지정 주차장이 아니라더군요. 지정주차장은 한 블럭 떨어져 있다는데 옆 주차장이 호텔스닷컴에 사전 공지된 주차요금 수준 (24시간 55달러) 이어서 수긍은 했습니다.하지만 이럴줄 알았다면 미리 스팟히어로 같은 서비스로 근처 사설 주차장에 주차하는게 싸게칠 것 같네요.,Aug 18| 2019,4
Nous avons séjourné à l’hôtel du 12 au 14 août dernier! L’hôtel est très bien situé alors je recommande. La chambre est petite mais les lits sont confortables et comme nous ne sommes pas beaucoup dans la chambre c’est ok! Plein de resto au alentour alors il y est facile de trouver petit déjeuner! Le café Keurig est disponible. Il y a 2 bouteilles d’eau payantes 3$ us chaque ce qui est exagéré... nous ne les avons pas utilisé et l’hôtel nous les a chargé sur ma carte de crédit...alors j’ai dû faire des démarches pour faire canceller le 8|20$ can sur ma carte de crédit... je trouve l’hôtel très malhonnête car on m’avait confirmé que je n’avais aucun frais! Pour cette raison| je n’y retournerai pas car bris de confiance!!!,Aug 17| 2019,4
Ottima posizione| di fronte metro| via tranquilla a 2 passi dall' Empire.Personale gentililissimo e colazione veramente buona a buffet.L'unica cosa non al top è  stata l aria condizionata in camera| veramente troppo rumorosa| ma a noi non serviva quindi la tenevamo spenta.Nel complesso ottima esperienza lo consiglio.Comunqie,Aug 14| 2019,5
Super placeret hotel i Midtown. Venligt personale og rene værelser. Vi kommer gerne igen,Aug 10| 2019,5
Bodde flere steder i New York. Det er generelt dyrt å bo sentralt| men sammenlignet med andre steder syns jeg ikke det var verdt den prisen vi betalte. Vi var litt uheldige ved å ha rommet rett ved baren deres og dermed veldig mye støy. Når vår hårføner ikke funket tok det tid før vi fikk en ny.,Jul 28| 2019,3

Belle grandeur de douche.  Odeur bizarre dans la salle de bain à certain moment de la journée.  Nous avons signalé à l'hôtel en quittant pour qu'ils puissent s'en occuper.  Over all| très satisfait.,Jul 5| 2019,4

It was a nice stay. The staff was nice. We were disturbed the 2nd night because of another guest who smoked in the bathroom (no smoking hotel!) and the firefighters showing at 1-2 am. We didn’t really sleep after that. The hotel paid our parking for the stay.,May 24| 2019,4

Chambre au 17ème| avec une très jolie vue sur les buildings alentours. Frigo de bonne taille et micro-ondes dans la chambre. Lit très spacieux et confortable. Wi-fi rapide. Rien à redire à aucun niveau. Nous avons très| très bien dormi. Unique petit détail| la bouche de renouvellement de l'air (puisqu'on ne peut pas ouvrir les fenêtres) fait pas mal de bruit de façon continue| mais on s'y fait vite.,Apr 10| 2019,5

Elegí ese hotel por ubicación porque tenía una junta cerca de ahí. Es un hotel muy básico| la habitación es pequeña| hay un pasillo diminuto entre la cama y la tv| me pegue 3 veces con los filos de las jaladeras de los cajones porque no hay espacio| los amenities son de neutrogena. Las sábanas| edredón| toallas| etc no son lo que esperaba. A favor: el personal súper amable y eficiente en checkin y checkout| hay microondas y cafetera| hay café y té en la recepción sin costo| mi habitación era silenciosa. Volvería a quedarme ahí si hiciera muchísimo frío y es lo mas cerca de lo contrario prefiero algo más fashion aunque tenga que caminar.,Jan 11| 2019,3

Läget var fantastiskt bra med "gång" avstånd till de centrala delarna. Servicen på hotellet var mycket bra. Grön Tunnelbanelinje "33 street" bara 50 m från hotellet.Rummen var dock i minsta laget för 4 personer men det funkade.Tar man tåget in till Penn Station från Newark| kan man promenera till hotellet på 10 minuter.,Nov 1| 2018,4

The hotel is perfectly located. In front of the hotel you can park your car free of charge over the weekend (starting on Friday at 6pm). What I also did. But I do not understand why the hotel staff was sending me to a park house for ... 56 USD / day ! The room is not big. It was enough for me| but I expected something a bit bigger.

Este lugar te ofrece un excelente servicio con la garantía de un hotel de cadena. Está muy bien ubicado para conocer la ciudad; puedes llegar caminando a muchos puntos de interés y tienes la estación de metro casi enfrente del hotel. El servicio muy bueno| personal muy atento| en nuestro caso el desayuno estuvo incluido. La limpieza impecable. Lo recomendaríamos totalmente. Hay otras opciones de hoteles que parecen más baratas pero el riesgo de una mala experiencia es muy alto. Definitivamente volveríamos a hospedarnos aquí.,May 16| 2018,5
メトロの駅（⑥番線：33st）からすぐの非常に便利な立地です。近くにセブンイレブンやドラッグストア・デリなどもあり、遅い時間に水や軽食を買うのにも困りませんでした。Times Squareまでは少し離れていますが（徒歩20分程度）充分歩いていける距離です。ホテルの部屋も、清潔で充分な広さがあります。朝・晩にロビーでコーヒーサービスがあるのも、嬉しいですね。,May 10| 2018,5

Wir waren eine Woche in New York. Das Hotel ist die ideale Ausgangslage für alle Attraktionen in NYC.Die Penn Station ist schnell zu Fuß erreichbar und das Empire State Building praktisch vor der Haustüre. Subway ist auch um die Ecke. Haben ein Zimmer mit Aussicht gebucht und waren im 25.Stock| Zimmer 2504. Es war eine tolle Aussicht bei Nacht und für Manhattan Verhältnisse auch relativ ruhig (nachdem wir den Stecker der Minibar gezogen hatten).Wenn man sucht wird man natürlich immer fündig und für die ganz kritischen gäbe es sicher auch was auszusetzen:- Handtücher einmal vergessen (mussten uns mit Waschlappen trocknen| da zu spät bemerkt)- Handseife jeden Tag gewechselt und eine neue Verpackung hingelegt| was einfach Verschwendung ist- Toilette nicht immer geputzt| was auffällt wenn es keine Klobürsten gibt- ein Haar in der Dusche bei Anreise - Fön zwar leistungsstark aber sehr abgenutzt und nicht ganz sauber - kostenloses Wasser im Foyer manchmal nicht aufgefüllt-laute Minibar| die unbefüllt ist Diese Dinge sind uns aufgefallen. Sie sind aber absolut nebensächlich und haben uns nicht direkt gestört.Aber vielleicht sind sie gut zu wissen für ganz penible Leute. Die Zimmergröße war ok. Man darf kein großes Zimmer erwarten| aber man kann es eine Woche aushalten. Das Bad war komplett neu renoviert. Auch die Tapeten und Bilder sahen toll und hochwertig aus. Wir haben den Aufenthalt sehr genossen und kommen beim nächsten NYC Urlaub wieder!!!,Apr 10| 2018,4
Sehr schönes und sauberes Hotel zentral am Empire State Building und nur 10 min zu Fuß zur Grand Central Station.,Mar 24| 2018,4
Primeiro quarto que peguei estava com lençóis sujos e cabelos por todo o canto. Me trocaram por outro que apesar de limpo era todo manchado e com móveis já desgastados e semi-quebrados. O ar-condicionado fazia barulho o tempo todo e a manutenção só foi checar após pedidos insistentes e ainda assim nada fez o hotel.,Mar 17| 2018,2
Very good| good staff| placing and overall good! Ill go there again next time.,Mar 13| 2018,5
Perfekter Ausgangspunkt für eine Städtereise. Das Hotel ist in einem super Zustand| die Zimmer sind sehr modern eingerichtet und sehr sauber.,Mar 11| 2018,5
O hotel é bem localizado| a poucas quadras da Quinta Avenida| Times Square e a area mais movimentada. Tem uma estação do metro na frente do hotel| o que facilita| mas na época em que estivemos| devido a manutenções| os trens downtown não paravam na estação em determinados horarios e dias| o que causava a necessidade de descer 5 estações abaixo e pegar o mesmo trem uptown.,Mar 1| 2018,4
Prima verblijf| super schoon en op een ideale locatie.,Feb 25| 2018,5
Hotel war super. Personal sehr hilfsbereit und sehr geduldig. Trotz sprachverständigung nie die Geduld verloren. Nur leider etwas weit vom Zentrum entfernt. Hatten eine kleines Problem welches auch direkt behoben wurde. Kann es nur jedem empfehlen. Das Einzige negative war die Dusche| wenn man duschte stand das ganze Bad unter Wasser.,Feb 16| 2018,5
The place does not offer valet parking as Orbitz states| but offsite parking not too far from the location. The rooms were small but clean. There was no hot water in our shower when we arrived and no hot water in the morning either. We had a busy day in NY so we didn’t use any other amenities.,Aug 16| 2021,3
This hotel was dirty and very outdated and the air conditioning hardly worked. For the price you pay you could get much more. Our first room had throw up on the floor that didn’t even look like was attempted to be cleaned| luckily we were able to get a new room when we complained about it| the front desk staff didn’t even seem surprised.,Aug 15| 2021,2
No toilet paper,Aug 14| 2021,3
Rooms were a bit smaller than I thought| blankets were a bit outdated but overall it was a good stay,Aug 7| 2021,4
Súper nice,Aug 7| 2021,5
Very conveniently located closer to airport and to LMU. Friendly staff,Aug 3| 2021,4
Great location and facility is clean and safe.,Aug 3| 2021,5
Cacey at the reception was awesome! Rooms were small but clean. Which that the hotel bar could have been open. Overall excellent!,Aug 3| 2021,5
It is located in a really nice area. Very accessible.,Aug 1| 2021,4
I didn’t like the fact that my room was right next to the house keeping closet. I heard them gathering their items throughout the day.,Jul 31| 2021,5
Location| beautiful room and cleanliness,Jul 29| 2021,5
The location was perfect for walking| subway and bus use.  The desk workers were very helpful!,Jul 28| 2021,5
All good,Jul 28| 2021,4
The unique thing that I don’t like Is the room deposit that in the information say no deposit in the check in and we think that was true. For or lucky we have money extra but I dont know if we don’t what’ll happend in that case. Everything else was super!,Jul 27| 2021,5
It was very close to the metro station. Big rooms.,Jul 27| 2021,4
Small room & trash everywhere,Jul 27| 2021,1
Perfect location,Jul 27| 2021,4
The property was located in a great location but it was odd to not get room serviced during our stay. We had to request for new towels a and amenities. They did not pick up the room anytime during the stay.,Jul 26| 2021,3
The staff was so friendly and welcoming oh and accommodating WILL DEFINITELY COME AGAIN JUST TO STAY HERE,Jul 26| 2021,5
Very good Customer Service,Jul 26| 2021,5
Friendly staff,Jul 25| 2021,4
Came up to our room on the second night to find it was not serviced by house keeping. We called the front desk and were told that they don’t provide house keeping without a specific request anymore. While I understand the reason I should have been informed when I checked in.,Jul 24| 2021,4
Location,Jul 23| 2021,5
Generally a great location and good stay. An unexpected surprise was that parking wasn't included and was a hefty $50 per night. This would have been great to know ahead of time. And we weren't told at check in to request housekeeping the day before. Great about requiring guests to mask in shared areas. Staff were friendly and pleasant and room a bit tired but comfortable.,Jul 23| 2021,4
We liked the location.We did not like the limited space in rooms| furniture needs to be updated.......we honestly expected a little more being in New York. Also the fact that breakfast is not included in the price was a total disappointment for us considering that we had kids. And sorry but the wait just to get on the elevator was frustrating specially cause the halls felt hot and humid.,Jul 21| 2021,3
The hotel is in a good neighborhood and close to subway lines and attractions | it was clean and staff was friendly and kind. But when we made our booking it said it has breakfast included and it doesn’t| that was a surprise. We also witnessed a guest claiming the website offers valet parking and it doesn’t have it.  The system to eat at the hotel restaurant is weird and make it difficult since you have to get an app and order your food through it. There are a couple of places to eat around that are very good: The Mill and Paris Baguette| one block away.,Jul 20| 2021,3
la ubicacion del hotel es excelente| cerca de la quinta avenida| caminando llegas al central park| en la calle segunda tienes muchos restaurantes a elegir para comer sin tener que tomar taxi| en las banquetas mucha basura!!!!!!! frente al hotel.. basura!!! y no tienes servicio de limpieza| quiero pensar que es por la pandemia covid| por lo demas si lo recomiendo,Jul 20| 2021,4
It clearly states in the description that they offer valet peeking service which they do not.,Jul 16| 2021,4
Like the size of beds| and room. The view from my room floor 26. Quiet zone.One of the elevator was out of service so was uncomfortable to wait a lot for the elevator. Twice we used the stairs.,Jul 14| 2021,4
Excelente ubicación y servicio!,Jul 13| 2021,5
Decent location.  Do not understand lack of attention to needs of the room| such as towels| garbage| beds| etc.  Using covid as an excuse?,Jul 12| 2021,3
First I would like to say that the rooms were clean which is important to me. However| if you want maid service you have to let them know The maids do not come automatically like they have in the past. But here comes the bad part of the stay. The elevators were consistently not working and my family had to walk down the stairs from the 24th floor. Everyday during our stay one of the elevators were not working and many guests were upset.  Some had to get to the airport & this inconveniencewas hoping to make them late. One night we were on the elevator and the elevator free fall dropped 5 floors & then the doors would not open| It was scary & I felt like I was on the Tower of Terror @ Disney. Also| our coffee maker in the room did not work. This was also frustrating. This hotel definitely needs to be updated.,Jul 10| 2021,1
Good breakfast and comfy beds.,Jul 8| 2021,4
The property had 22 floors with two elevators and 1 of the elevators was out of service!!!! Spend most of my weekend trying to get in and out of my room!!!!!!!!,Jul 7| 2021,2
The room was clean and comfortable. For NYC| a nice amount of room for the price. But the shower was lukewarm at best| with very low pressure and one of two elevators was out of service| meaning that we took the stairs down nine floors a couple times| rather than wait forever.,Jul 7| 2021,3
.,Jul 6| 2021,5
The staff was very nice and helpful. The room was decent and comfortable.,Jul 6| 2021,4
Meh. It’s a hotel. Only one elevator functioning made for extremely long waits unless to felt like climbing the stairs,Jul 6| 2021,3
stayed for almost 2 weeks. The staff are so great especially the manager Rani. will stay again in the future. the only down side is one elevator working during my stay .,Jul 6| 2021,5
Clean| good location. One of the elevators was out of service| which was problematic since the hotel has more than 20 floors and trying to go up or down took almost 30 minutes sometimes since the working elevator was always full and slow. One of the reception enployees was very friendly and accomodating| but the other wasn't very  helpful.,Jul 6| 2021,3
Great location| comfortable beds and nice shower pressure...great customer service from Managers on Duty!!,Jul 4| 2021,4
Our stay was fine. The shower was a bit dirty and one of the elevators was broken during the duration of our stay. However| the staff was always very accommodating and pleasant.,Jul 4| 2021,3
Stayed there over July 4th weekend. Very busy. Elevator was broken leaving only one in use. Waited 1/2 hour for elevator and check out line was a nightmare. Between broken elevator and long checkout line it took an hour to check out. Also there are only a couple luggage carts to bring your things downstairs. Need more carts.,Jul 4| 2021,5
Our experience was extremely disappointing. Elevators went out f service then only 1 was restored to service. The car was extremely slow and extremely small. Climate control in the room was inadequate. The staff was inattentive and gruff. The room was poorly laid out  We will not be booking this location,Jul 3| 2021,2
As is often the case in Manhattan| check in is a bit stressful. You have to park kind of illegally near the hotel entrance and quickly run inside to check in. The parking is not very close and is on a different street. The first place I went to was not the right one but the nice attendant seemed used to people making the same mistake. The right one was about 100 yards (or meters) further. The GPS becomes less reliable among the tall buildings. Eventually ot worked out fine.No in and out privileges but a car can be more of a hassle in Manhattan.The staff took care of our few needs.One of two elevators broke. Another classic big city occurrence but other than few extra minutes of waiting| it was not too bad. I think the hotel| just like the rest of NYC| was significantly less crowded than prepandemic still.The breakfast was not the usual continental buffet. It was a nice change and quite pleasant. We had booked the room with breakfast included which probably was a good move.,Jul 3| 2021,4
.,Jul 2| 2021,2
Very nice hotel| great amenities|  super nice staff,Jul 2| 2021,5
great location-on saturday night| room smelled of Marijuana from people smoking in their room. On thursday| my toilet was running constantly-at 1am it sounded like my toilet was going to explode...so loud and noisy.  The manager said he couldnt do anything because i booked on expedia....disappointed.,Jun 28| 2021,1
Came home to a room filled with pot smoke the third night. I suppose someone was smoking out in their room and it infiltrated the ventilation system.  Gross,Jun 28| 2021,2
Located in the heart of NYC,Jun 23| 2021,3
The room was very clean.  We felt safe there.,Jun 21| 2021,5
The stay was great.,Jun 21| 2021,5
Not much,Jun 18| 2021,3
They let me check in at 9 a.m.!!!! They're located in a really safe area| less than a block away from a really nice Subway station| which is definitely uncommon. There's always someone available to help and there's a sushi restaurante open until 2 a.m. right next door. Can't get a better hotel in Manhattan| honestly.,Jun 18| 2021,5
I love everything except for the room. We booked a premium room with city views. The views were ok but the room is small. There’s 3 people and we can barely walk in the room. Come here with small suitcases or else nothing will fit. But I love how clean and attentive the staff are. The area is safe. There’s a Japanese restaurant next which is a plus.,Jun 15| 2021,5
Room are cleans,Jun 14| 2021,5
Very clean| great service and good location! Highly recommend and will stay there again.,Jun 14| 2021,5
I love the area where this hotel is located. It is super convenient to the subway| easy to get across town| and lots of dining options within walking distance. I also feel very safe in this neighborhood. A very cold room is very important to me and this one did not disappoint! The shower had great water pressure. The bed was very comfortable and the room was very clean. The only downside was the location of my room. It was on the 2nd floor over the hotel entrance. The view was not good| but to be fair to the hotel...I was a late arrival| I did not request a high floor and I did not complain about it at the property. I travel to NYC frequently| so the view was not that important to me. I would definitely recommend this property!,Jun 14| 2021,5
As all New York hotel rooms are small| it was clean | comfy enough space for 2 and 4 bags| very close to fifth avenue| around the block  a parking underground  ICON for 24 hours for $45 and some for $60| park on the street for free BUT move the car before 7 am!,Jun 12| 2021,5
The staff was friendly and helpful| the room clean and comfortable. With daily service in rooms suspended| the hotel provides no way to dispose of trash. Everyone takes their trash down to the lobby| kind of disgusting,Jun 9| 2021,4
Clean and convenient for traveling,Jun 9| 2021,4
Great location at a great price,Jun 6| 2021,5
Spacious room with great amenities (including coffee & microwave).  Room was clean and I felt safe staying there during Covid times.  Location cannot be beat| around the corner to the subway station and plenty of bars/restaurants in the area. Many tourist attractions are within walking distance.,Jun 1| 2021,5
Hotel was clean. Checking in was quick but checking out was a bit of a hassle.  No valet was a bummer but considering the price and locaion i would stay here again and recommend to anyone.,Jun 1| 2021,4
Nice hotel in the heart of mid-town| located close to metro stations and grocery stores. Really quiet| away from tourist madness in case you want to avoid that.,May 31| 2021,5
Price was great. Parking inconvenient.,May 30| 2021,4
No room cleaning unless requested due to Covid. I appreciated this because it was my first hotel stay since the outbreak and didn’t want anyone entering my room.  Staff was super helpful and added little touches such as remembering and greeting me by name.  Will stay there again next time in nyc considering all the Airbnbs seem to have disappeared in nyc. Convenient location to launc both up and downtown.  Took Covid precautions seriously and no noise,May 28| 2021,4
Comfortable beds| convenient location but showers and bathroom fans faulty.,May 26| 2021,3
Couldn’t find my reservation I made a month out | So I was charged a different rate than what my reservation stated . I even gave reservations number showed the gentleman at the front desk and he still charged my card a higher rate. So I’m not happy with Hilton or Hotels.com. Have to use other companies,May 24| 2021,1
Donny| at the front desk was friendly and helpful. he helped make my stay very enjoyable,May 24| 2021,5
I chose this location as it lists having Valet Parking. This is not accurate. The hotel no longer offers valet parking. You can unload outside the hotel and check in| receive a voucher to park your car 5-5 blocks away.,May 21| 2021,4
Good location| we needed to be close to a hospital. Rony in the front desk was very helpful and kind.,May 21| 2021,4
Great stay,May 17| 2021,5
Poor maintenance| room was not cleaned in a dailly basis|Trash i the room was not pickup daily.  I pay for a supposed breakfast buffet| but it was a single plate serving| anything extra was not covered.  Prices at the local store were very high compare to other stores in the neighborhood,May 16| 2021,2
Great stay | close to everything| staff was great. Will return again.,May 15| 2021,5
Good location,May 14| 2021,4
Clean and so close to the airport,May 12| 2021,5
We really enjoyed our stay| our views were amazing..the hotel was very clean and helpful with everything. We was able to check in early because our flight landed early. That was a blessing. The front desk clerks were extremely nice and helpful. We will stay again..,May 11| 2021,5
Overall experience...stayed there before but this time wasn’t a good experience...I’m a Hilton honors gold member...I book the room through Expedia because I had a credit with them..at the check in I asked if was possible to get an upgrade because the hotel had inventory available and I know the rules with Expedia...but come on ... then what in the gold membership for? Then I asked for the breakfast vouchers that I paid for and they told me that wasn’t showing up on the system... I look for my confirmation email on my phone to prove that I was telling the truth...when I showed the email they ask me to close the shot to verify if those vouchers belonged to my reservation... really? What is the gold membership for if you feel treated as if you want to take advantage for services you didn’t pay for...then at the room the chair had the ugliest stain that in Covid times doesn’t make you feel that you are in a proper clean place...I took a photo in case you want to take a look...just replace the chair with one that doesn’t have any stains ....then breakfast was another experience completely different as before in that location...definitely not the overnight stay I was expecting and used to have there...,May 10| 2021,2
My room didn’t get serviced,May 10| 2021,3
Very good overall,May 10| 2021,5
Person at desk greeted me warmly and professionally.   The hotel is spotless.  Room is great.  Clean.  Nicely done.   Everything looks fairly new.  Quiet room with a refrigerator|  microwave and coffee maker.  The hotel locand neighborhood are safe and very walkable.  Good and variety of restaurants.   Everything from McDonald's to Smith and Wollensky.  A÷÷÷÷,May 10| 2021,5
Nothing at all unique.  Check in woman couldn’t be bothered to look up from her cell phone.  Small room w broken curtain and dead moth hanging from ceiling| although otherwise clean and comfortable.  This hotel could have been anywhere USA.  Other than good location| nothing special.,May 9| 2021,3
Great location. Clean room. Breakfast was sit down.,May 9| 2021,4
Small ass rooms | had a king premium room for no reason | nothing looked like the pictures and no view,May 4| 2021,1
My first room smelled of smoke. No toiletries in restroom. Refrigerator didn’t work. Staff not friendly.,May 3| 2021,3
Good location,May 2| 2021,5
The room and the service were decent ...but no valet parking as stated on their site. Only off site parking available three blocks away. Not easy to drag your suitcase that far...🙁,Apr 29| 2021,3
Amazing view,Apr 23| 2021,5
Pros: The staff is amazing.  They are so professional and friendly.  The location is great and close to subway station.  The down side is the need to spruce up the outdated room.  The shower tiles had mildew/mold| the AC unit was dirty and the mattress cover had signs of previous guests.  With a little TLC| this hotel will be awesome.,Apr 7| 2021,4
Location is far from everything. For a Hilton hotel I expected more it was old fashioned with tiny rooms. Housekeeping also took a pair of gucci socks from my bed and “lost them”. Ronny the manager finally got back to me 8 days later and was rude on the phone. Definitely will not be coming back here ever.,Apr 6| 2021,1
Awesome located just blocks away from Times Square 5th ave in love 💜💜💜,Apr 5| 2021,5
Very clean| great staff and  customer service,Feb 3| 2021,5

I have been here several times before.  It is now my first choice in NYC,Jan 15| 2021,5
Liked the location in midtown east.  Close to restaurants and other things we needed.  It was quiet.  Hotel front desk were friendly.,Jan 7| 2021,5
The whole stay of 4 nights was FABULOUS. The staff went above and beyond to ensure our comfort and cleanliness. Could have not asked for more. We come to NYC often and you can be sure we will stay there again. Best hotel I have stayed in there. Fabulous Italian restaurant next door was an added plus. Thank you many times for your kindness v,Dec 14| 2020,5
I stayed for 5 days in king bed room. Staffs were friendly and kind. Room was clean and organized. Coffee machine| microwave| big window and desk in the room. Great to WFH while staying here.,Dec 13| 2020,5
2nd time here in 2020 Covid Pandemic. This time I had to bring my 5y/o and 13y/o and was completely comfortable doing so.  WONDERFUL staff| amazingly clean and safe| great location. Top Notch Hotel!!!!,Dec 11| 2020,5

Great service very clean BUT my room bed was not to sturdy definitely needed a new mattress,Nov 15| 2020,5
We have stayed at many hotels in the city in the last few years and this Hilton is one of the cleanest| well maintained and organized Hiltons. This is our preferred hotel when we need to stay in New York city.,Nov 4| 2020,5
Clean| safe and walking distance to many attractions. I am a native to NYC and visit often. I am impressed by this hotel. I highly recommend. Has cheap/close parking| walking distance to Rockefeller Center/Nintendo/American Girl/LEGO/etc.| an AMAZING Paris Bakery| Starbucks and restaurants/bars. Hotel is quite| staff is polite| helpful| Covid-Compliant and will go above and beyond to make sure your stay is a happy one. A truly top notch hotel.,Oct 26| 2020,5

Clean |and very friendly staff . Good location |walking distance to shopping and local landmarks .,Sep 1| 2020,5
It was a very pleasant stay..the only tough thing is the parking which is a bit of a walk.  Might be helpful to add valet parking option to your guests. Overall we were happy with the stay.,Aug 25| 2020,4
Staff were polite and welcoming. Room was clean which was one of my biggest concerns,Aug 23| 2020,4
The front desk staff couldn’t have been,Aug 7| 2020,5
The service was good and location very good for my purposes. For the money| and name| I was expecting a little more in the way of size and amenities. Room was a little cramped with little comfortable seating. Bathroom kind of small too. Walls a little thin| constant noise from adjoining room. Bed was comfortable. Very helpful staff. Just a lot of money for what you get and not as nice as other Hiltons I have stayed at.,Jul 24| 2020,3
The front desk staff member could not have been more helpful or friendly. The room was clean and extremely comfortable. Would definitely stay again.,Jul 22| 2020,5
It was a great stay for a short weekend. Everything was clean and comfortable and practice social distancing. Everyone had a mask on walking thru the hotel.,Jul 19| 2020,5
Fast check in and the location is awesome.. Everything was perfect| except for the previous guests trash still in the room. Felt super safe here as a solo traveler. Excellent Japanese (BYOB) next door with exceptionally friendly people working there.  About a 20 minute walk to Sloan on york and 67th.,Jul 4| 2020,5
A Very clean| comfortable stay . Very secure too . It was very quiet  also .  I love that there is a fridge and Keurig coffee  maker available in the room. Staff was very accommodating and friendly .   This was a wonderful experience.,Jul 3| 2020,5
We really liked the location and found the staff to be friendly and accommodating.,Jun 22| 2020,5
Stayed for a few hours sleep and a shower in-between shifts,Jun 16| 2020,4
Great location| walking distance to most attractions as well as eateries. Only issue I had was the shower didn’t drain properly but I didn’t want to change rooms or have anyone inside to fix it.,Jun 3| 2020,4
It was a great experience I will definitely stay over again. Customer service was great  and nice location. What made it even better is that we had a balcony to ourselves.,Jun 1| 2020,5
The staff was very pleasant and helpful. Lisbeth and the 2 gentlemen. Sorry I don’t remember either of their names. My daughter loss her first child and she was New York Presbyterian 68th and  York| This hotel was five minutes away. The hospital allowed on support because I drove her I was able to stay until her boyfriend arrived. I was able to sit in the hotel and watch her give birth on FaceTime and cheer her on despite she would not be able to bring her daughter Hasina home. I explained to the staff as they inquired our stay. They offered up condolences and sentiments. Thank you 🙏,Apr 19| 2020,5
It was good but for the corona| they didnt clean the room.,Mar 15| 2020,3
The woman at the front desk was great. Very helpful and super friendly.,Mar 15| 2020,5
This is the best location in NYC! It is close enough to talk everywhere in midtown but away from the crazy crowds! You can always find thr best non-touritsy places to eat around here. Jamesons Pub around the corner has the best Irish music without the tourist crowds!,Mar 10| 2020,5
I was in NYC to visit my daughter and booked this hotel as it was just around the corner| so for me it was an excellent location but even if I hadn't needed to be in this area| I would still recommend it. Subway very close| lots of lovely cafés and restaurants nearby| plus very quiet and still only a short walk to Bloomingdales!Really nice lobby with lovely fireplace| helpful staff| spacious room with great view and really comfortable bed. All spotlessly clean. I'll definitely be going back.,Mar 9| 2020,5
Great location and value. Housekeeping service was spotty - forgot to replace some items most days and were late cleaning our room several times. Walls are thin and you could hear the elevator running. Room was small but comfortable.,Mar 3| 2020,3
Amazing place close to everything| clean and accessible to transport| shops and restaurants around | definitely will come back again,Mar 2| 2020,5
Loved the hotel. Awesome location and good customer service. Very clean and super nice room. Would definitely stay at this location again 😁,Feb 27| 2020,5
Hotel was well priced| and as per the description. Reception was always very friendly. Didn't eat inside- but for the price| cannot complain. All good.,Feb 24| 2020,5
The elevators- only two and one not working ever regardless if what stAff state- and then a 50 dollar day fee added! Forget it- for nothing.,Feb 23| 2020,3
We could hear the people in the room next to us. The walls are paper thin. The shower door would not close properly so water ran all over the floor| toilet paper arm was hanging off the wall| space was tight| elevators were slow.,Feb 18| 2020,2
The staff at this hotel were amazing. Friendly and helpful for us out-of-towners that were a little overwhelmed by the city. We weren't able to check in early but they stored our bags and we were off to explore. The room was clean but super small. I would definitely stay here again!,Feb 18| 2020,5
Nice clean rooms| reasonably priced| lovely staff - overall we really enjoyed our stay. Only downside is the elevators| they can be quite slow. But if you don’t mind waiting an extra few minutes it’s quite fine.,Feb 17| 2020,5
Very comfortable stay.  The only hiccup was that no one cleaned my room despite telling the front desk twice.  I received a breakfast voucher instead. Otherwise I would stay here again.  Hilton Garden Inn also doesn’t charge facilities fees like other NYC hotels do...,Feb 16| 2020,4
Very friendly| accommodating staff| clean room!,Feb 14| 2020,5
Suoer,Feb 12| 2020,5
Glad I decided to stay here this time. So happy with the room| much more spacious than the hotels near Times Square. Very clean and great view. The staff was nice as well. Wish I had a counter in the bathroom but it worked out fine. I left my makeup and large items on the counter by the tv,Feb 11| 2020,5
Was able to get into my room early.  The staff was nice and welcoming| very accommodating and friendly.  Only complaint was the breakfast.  All the food was cold| and for $23 per person you'd expect food to order to be hot.  So| I wish I'd gone out to a diner. But the room was great!,Feb 10| 2020,5
Love the Cookies and the coffee and the staff were very nice,Feb 10| 2020,5
Everything was great| everybody was soo nice and helpful| nice room.  Only problem was the elevator.  We were on the 22nd floor and there are only 2 elevators so it can be slow going.  And then one elevator broke so the waits were really long (25min).,Feb 9| 2020,5
Everything went well. Staff was pleasant and clean room. Appreciated the later check out. The only problem was a really long wait for the elevator. We did strike up a nice conversation with another guest while waiting. I gave up and took the stairs. Lucky I didn’t have heavy luggage. Overall| a nice stay in midtown Manhattan.,Feb 7| 2020,4
Staff were so friendly and welcoming| always wishing you a good day and offering their help. We also appreciated the flavoured water snacks in the lobby each day. Would absolutely return here when next in New York !,Feb 5| 2020,5
the staff was very friendly. Our view form the room was less than steller but it was ok as we didn't spend much time in the room.,Feb 3| 2020,5
Hilton Garden is a consistently clean and affordable place to stay| however| they had only one elevator working and we had to wait a long time| each time we rode (we were on 23rd floor). Had to stop at every other floor on way down and the elevator was soo overcrowded and uncomfortable!Positive notes.... melon infused water in the lobby| very nice staff| great location and clean| spacious rooms.,Feb 3| 2020,4
Small room| but it's a perfect location. Easy access to everywhere and it's right by the train station.,Jan 30| 2020,4
Everything is good| except that the day we would be leaving| a staff knocked at our door to ask what time we would be leaving which is a quite rude.,Jan 26| 2020,5
Room was nice and enjoyed the stay. However| after I checked out| I was charged for a breakfast I did not eat. I called and they did not believe me despite the signature on the receipt not matching my signature. We did not eat in the restaurant during our stay. It took multiple phone calls to get resolved. Totally unacceptable to not disclose these charges at checkout or to not believe me when I initially called. Zandra from billing was very unprofessional during the phone call and was more accusatory than apologetic.,Jan 23| 2020,1
excellent location. good staffs. fine restaurants are nearby. clean and well managed. only problem was noise from the neighboring room.,Jan 23| 2020,4
I loved my stay,Jan 21| 2020,5
Super loud| you can hear your neighbors behind the wall and the elevator running up and down. TV would turn off every 5 min or so.,Jan 20| 2020,1
The room was excellent - nicely renovated and very clean and excellent housekeeping staff.,Jan 20| 2020,5
The elevator had a mind of it's own| had to use the stairs. Room keys didn't work easily. Staff very nice and helpful!,Jan 20| 2020,4
It was very clean and quiet. I had a very good stay. Will recomend it to friends.,Jan 20| 2020,5
The staff was extremely accommodating| bartender was extremely helpful.  I wish I was able to eat at the hotel but we had a tight schedule.  Would definitely stay here again.,Jan 20| 2020,5
Clean rooms. Tv right in front of the bed. Fridge and microwave. Room service is fast.,Jan 19| 2020,4
Very clean| easy to get to| staff very friendly.,Jan 19| 2020,5
The heater blew cold air most of the night or very hot air.(no middle ground). The shower was terrible - you can't turn on the water without getting caught under the shower head - which means every shower starts off freezing - stupid concept.,Jan 19| 2020,3
Front desk was extremely helpful. Nice location. Quit walk to a metro station| coffee| and bagels!!!,Jan 19| 2020,4
Clean| comfortable rooms. Hotel is conveniently located near major subway stations.,Jan 17| 2020,4
Proximity to interesting section of 2nd Ave. Efficient| clean| friendly.,Jan 16| 2020,4
Excellent!! Clean!!! Close to everything!!!,Jan 14| 2020,5
the Hilton Garden Inn was close to so many sites | so we walked everywhere . We took a Via car from Laguardia for a good deal . Staff at the hotel were friendly . The room was smallish | but clean and comfortable | and we didn't spend much time there anyway .,Jan 13| 2020,4
Great location with proximity to many places of interest| Whole Foods| parking.,Jan 11| 2020,4
Really love the location. Front desk staff very friendly!!,Jan 9| 2020,4
Friendly staff| very helpful.We were challenged with the elevator| but help was always available.The cafe was convenient and our meal was good.,Jan 9| 2020,4
Always great staff with Marriott and they are really well organized and readily available,Jan 8| 2020,5
Stayed twice at this hotel through Expedia. Not entirely sure if it’s a coincidence staying in the same room with smelly bathroom. It felt like I was in a hospital room.,Jan 8| 2020,1
Very happy we selected a room on the 3rd Floor. Convenient location and attentive staff. Nice little restaurant and bar in the lobby. Clean and quiet. Free Wi-Fi. We will plan another visit.,Jan 8| 2020,4
Very good location and very nice staff. I will definitely stay here again when I go back to visit,Jan 6| 2020,5
This hotel serves any guest well. It is conveniently located to the numerous Manhattan area must-sees including Times Square| Central Park| etc. Service| for the most part| is genuinely friendly and courteous.,Dec 30| 2019,5
My reservation was moved from a Hilton Garden to a Holiday Inn Express ... which is a huge down grade as far as I am concerned.  I was never contacted prior to my arrival at Hilton Garden and after walking 2 miles to get there| we had to walk again to another hotel.  The Holiday Inn Express is not as nice as a Hilton Garden Inn.  I am a Hilton Honors member and lost earning points by being moved.,Dec 28| 2019,1
Nice place close to midtown..,Dec 27| 2019,4
Great stay with the family| had nice help from the front desk with our luggage. Rooms not as spacious to walk around in| but the whole area was clean and comfortable to rest in.,Dec 27| 2019,5
Toilet was running and the heat didn’t adjust but then we saw the thermostat on the wall the next day. So our night was a little warm. The room had nice amenities and was pretty clean. Front desk personnel were excellent!,Dec 23| 2019,4
Wonderful service,Dec 23| 2019,5
Great location. Very clean and staff was beyond great. Coffee service every morning a big plus.,Dec 23| 2019,5
I didnt like that housekeeping knocked on my door 3 times in morning. First 830 am I put do not disturb on door. Then at| 1030 am and then 1115. Check out is 12pm. It was annoying. I understand its holiday time they want to clean & fill rooms but they should check with front desk who checked out.,Dec 22| 2019,3
Beautiful hotel and the staff was so accommodating!,Dec 17| 2019,5
Great Stay!!!!  Love the location!!  Everyone very helpful and friendly at Hilton,Dec 16| 2019,5
Easy check in|friendly staff|quiet & accessable to great eateries & shopping.,Dec 13| 2019,5
As soon as i walked into the Hotel the lobby it was fulled with Christmas decorations & it was very beautiful. Christina the Supervisor helped me with my reservation she was super sweet and to top it off she gave me a view of the city that made my evening.,Dec 10| 2019,5
Hilton Garden Inn was excellentBrilliant location| great service.Older style rooms but immaculately clean and perfectly fine,Dec 10| 2019,5
I loved the fact they had parking. Expensive and your not supposed to use your car the entire duration of your stay| however we got lucky and were able to use our car to travel to see the statue of liberty! Great trip! Wish we had more time there! Will definitely be going back in the near future!,Dec 9| 2019,5
This location is close to Central Park and the Subway Terminal.,Dec 3| 2019,5
friendly staff at receptionsometimes long wait for elevator,Dec 3| 2019,4
Clean rooms and quick check in. Located in a central location with cute bars.,Dec 3| 2019,5
Good service. The only problem was one of the elevators was down for a little while. Other than that everything thing was great.,Dec 1| 2019,4
Excellent,Nov 29| 2019,5
good,Nov 27| 2019,5
Rooms were much bigger than I expected & everything was nice and clean!,Nov 27| 2019,5
Great hotel| nice comfortable rooms ideal for how long we was staying for which was for 4 days. Well placed between 51st Lexington ave and 51st street subway stations| direct to Jamaica for JFK.,Nov 27| 2019,5
The location is great. LOTS of great restaurants. Not far from St. Patrick's Cathedral and the Madison Ave. high fashion stores.,Nov 27| 2019,5
It had everything one needed|  neatly packed within a room.,Nov 22| 2019,4
A parcel was left at reception by a relative. When I asked at checkout I was told no parcel was delivered. As delivery was confirmed by my relative some 30 minutes earlier| this just points to total incompetence by desk staff.,Nov 19| 2019,4
Clean and neat and inviting. Staff was VERY friendly,Nov 18| 2019,5
Disappointing hotel,Nov 14| 2019,2
Modern| clean and good mid-town location. Rooms good size. Breakfast decent| with excellent service in contrast  to reception.,Nov 13| 2019,4
I asked for a quiet room. got one down a short hall with only one other room; however other room had adjoining door and walls seemed thin so I heard lots of noise especially 12:00 am - 1:00 am with several guests talking loud| going in and out multiple times with a loud door closing. for both of my two nights the guests were noisy.Jaqueline expeditiously checked me in and was helpful. Desk/luggage staff was friendly and efficient.,Nov 12| 2019,4
Room was very dated & low quality especially for $300 a night. Probably won’t return.,Nov 11| 2019,5
I was expecting more for the location where is located.,Nov 7| 2019,3
The facility was a bit older and didn’t have proper utensils in the room even though it had a microwave and fridge. Paper cups were all that was available. But the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.,Nov 5| 2019,5
Location and rooms were not a shoe box unlike the rest of hotels close by.,Nov 4| 2019,5
Good central location. Easy check in and out. Room service outsourced although downstairs bar open till late.,Nov 2| 2019,4
Everything was great| only fault was noise from city came in through windows.,Oct 30| 2019,5
Excellent customer service and CLEAN which is very important to me - only thing that was bad was there was only 2 elevators and guests and staff had to wait forever to use them - but other than that it was a great stay!,Oct 28| 2019,5
The bed design is terrible!  Base sticks out further than matters and kept hitting it with shin.  Bathroom door swings out and is awkward getting shower ready.,Oct 27| 2019,4
The hotel rooms are very comfortable and the location in midtown East is great. Staff very accommodating. Breakfast is standard mid-level hotel fare at $15 for a continental and $22 for a full breakfast.,Oct 27| 2019,5
Pros: Hotel is modern and very clean with good-sized rooms. Location is great for Grand Central| UN| midtown offices. Cons: Wardrobe is smaller than a regular closet. Hallway design puts door close to each other| and when a neighbor's door opens/closes during the night it sounds like your own door is being opened. Elevators are fast but there are only two servicing 20+ floors—and one was shut off every night of my stay| so guests would have to line up and wait in the lobby to get to their rooms for 2-5 minutes at 11PM or 1AM.,Oct 21| 2019,4
Great location| the staff is super friendly| have stayed here many times and would stay again and again,Oct 21| 2019,4
We enjoyed the fact that it was very close to the attractions of NYC.- Times Square| Rockefeller Center| Empire State Building| Chrysler Building| Macy's| Central Park| etc. Located on a quiet street and reasonably priced.  Would return.,Oct 20| 2019,5
Went in the city for a girls weekend and stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn. Wonderful hotel| room was clean and big| bathroom was great with plenty of room. Front desk people were very pleasant and nice. Nothing bad to say| will definitely stay here again!,Oct 14| 2019,5
We had a wonderful reception by the Hotel personnel,Oct 14| 2019,5
Comfy and relatively quiet (for NYC). My TV keeps switching off and back on after 5 mins. I'm sure they will get that fixed sometime.,Oct 13| 2019,3
Very pleasant and situated well to enjoy New York,Oct 8| 2019,4
We were greeted by the best front desk person with a great personality. Unfortunately| I cannot remember her name. She demonstrated the BEST costumer service I have experienced!,Oct 3| 2019,4
Great little upper east side hotel. Would definitely recommend,Oct 2| 2019,4
Great location| clean rooms and friendly staff. We were very happy with our choice of hotel.,Sep 27| 2019,5
Great location | close to subway. Very friendly staff,Sep 24| 2019,4
Service from front desk to facilities were excellent and very helpful. I felt secure even being out late night with the staff present at all times. Room was clean and the pillows were perfect. The only thing that didn’t work was fan in the bathroom.,Sep 15| 2019,5
It was too cold in the room and I couldn't control the temperature.  The central air did not allow this.  There were no heavy blanket.  The fall is cool and they should calibrate the temperature.,Sep 15| 2019,3
Infused water available in the lobby. Umbrellas available to borrow,Sep 13| 2019,5
I'm rating this on the fact that I appear to have considerably overpaid| probably the last time I trust Expedia.  Although there are the usual things you'd expect from a Hilton| e.g. comfy bed and pleasant furnishings| I found some aspects lacking such as the shower which was pretty weak.  Two elevators is not enough| we were only on the 6th floor so I would have happily walked but the stairs are signed in such a way that it appears that you'd set off fire alarms if you dared to open the door so it was a case of waiting.Didn't use the bar or breakfast as despite being charged too much for this average room| breakfast wasn't included.Check-in process was slow as the guy was also on the phone doing something else| not sure if it was a private or work call.  On the positives| the rest of the time the staff were vary courteous when entering or leaving the hotel and I liked the free water and cookies in reception.  The holding luggage on your last day service is also very helpful.,Sep 10| 2019,3
Room smelled bad. Mildew sour smell in bathroom. Almost vomited from the horrible smell of the bathroom. Like old dirty mop water.,Sep 9| 2019,3
Location was ideal. We were within walking distance to all the places we needed to be!,Sep 9| 2019,5
Everyone was so helpful and thoughtful.   I would come back to this hotel my next visit to nyc.   Perfect location.,Sep 8| 2019,5
Location was convenient but the room was small and uncomfortable. I wouldn’t recommend booking rooms here for those on vacation. These room are designed for people staying in the city for business. That’s it.,Sep 6| 2019,2
Nice and clean. Room a bit small. But the bathroom is nice. Room is updated.,Sep 5| 2019,5
I booked breakfast but they said my booking didn’t come with that. It was super loud outside the hotel. I could hear everything from outside. That woke me up in the morning.,Sep 5| 2019,3
I booked a suite for my family and I and we got a small tiny room instead. It’s was very disappointing. The bed are okay but the pillows was not comfortable at all. The pillows were super thin| it’s like sleeping on the bed without a pillow. After our first night my niece who is 10 and my sister who is 13 were complaining about their neck and that the room was so small and crowded. My brother who is 16| not bother by the pillows but as for me; I am a traveler so I know what a good pillows likes.Other than that the customer service were good and helpful. The room is nice and clean| just way too small for a family of four. And the worst part for us is that our room were next to the contractions so it’s was not a good experience for us at all.,Sep 5| 2019,2
The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was nice shower was hot and good.,Sep 4| 2019,4
I like this hotel because of good location. It's only one block walking to subway and surrounded by a lot of restaurants. Also| the room is very clean and comfortable. Staff are friendly.,Sep 4| 2019,5
Excellent hotel with friendly staff. It's basic but everything you need.,Sep 2| 2019,4
Location is superb| which is why I chose it (short walk to Bloomingdale's| Fifth Ave).  Two minor problems| elevators are so slow and shower did not have enough power| despite being on 4th floor,Aug 26| 2019,4
Great hotel with friendly| helpful staff.  Everything was clean and neat.  They did an excellent job of servicing our room each day.  I’ll definitely plan to stay here again.,Aug 25| 2019,5
Very nice staff and good location. Comfortable rooms and quiet.,Aug 24| 2019,5
I wish that the faucet for the bathroom sink wasn’t so hard to turn on and off.  It was like the faucet handle was stuck or something.  Other than everything was fantastic.,Aug 24| 2019,5
I stayed here because my mom was having surgery at Sloan for her cancer and it was super convenient and close. The staff was phenomenal one of the kind women at the front desk even loaned me her charger because they were out and it was super late. My only complaint was the room service| the food was awful| premade and just bad. It was just easier for me to order before and after I got back from the hospital so as long as you aren’t relying on the food your stay will be amazing.,Aug 22| 2019,3
Location and staff friendliness| amenities coffee in the morning,Aug 21| 2019,5
Great location and friendly staff| room was clean and well maintained.,Aug 20| 2019,5
The pictures on the web made us believe it would be a nice room and a nice area. The area is a little far from the action and 52nd street is a bit blend. The room though is so narrow the four of us (my wife and two kids) couldn’t even be standing in the room at the same time. We had to sit on the beds so one person could go to the bathroom. When we got to the room upon checking in| the temperature was 76F. Who does that? Hotel should had set it up a lot cooler prior to our arrival. Then we tried to bring it back to 68F but never were able. We asked to have it fixed soon or to give us another room (it was 11:30pm so we wanted to go to bed but it was just too warm). They tried over and over to fix the A/C but never were able. They tried to resist to change the room but finally accepted. The new room was still that small (even though they had two queens). Two light were not working and the toilet kept on flushing itself. To top it off| their only parking solution is valet service at... $71 per day! What a scam. Almost $300 for 3 days. So now you are well advised on quality of that hotel.,Aug 20| 2019,1
The front desk was extremely nice and really took care of all my needs.,Aug 19| 2019,5
The hotel was in an excellent location and the staff and facilities were fantastic,Aug 18| 2019,5
Great location and friendly staff. Room was clean upon arrival and was a good enough size for all my needs.,Aug 18| 2019,5
This hotel was in  a good location| good staff. Needed the room last minute and got a clean room.,Aug 17| 2019,4
Clean decent size rooms for city nice bar only issueRoom in front and fairly loud street noise at night,Aug 10| 2019,5
Great staff. Easy check in. Great location walking distance to Central Park,Aug 8| 2019,5
Very noisy as walls so thin,Aug 7| 2019,2
We were 4 people in the room. Since first day we have to ask everyday for an extra towel. They never understood in 6 days| we need 4 towels. Unbelievable We did our check out yesterday. My husband forgot his sunglasses at the room 1708. He realized it 10 minutes later. We called the hotel 4 times and nobody pay real attention to it until I asked for the manager who direct my call to the cleaning staff. She already had the sunglasses with her.  So I asked her to send it to florida where we live. She immediately asked me for my credit card. She told me if I do not want to give her my credit card  I can send all the information to her email. This did not sound good to me. But I do not have another choise. I was in schock but I asked her the name Maria Bonilla and I gave my credit card information by phone.  I resquet to her to send the glasses by USPS priority mail. The postal office is near to the hotel. What a surprise this morning she sent the glasses via Fedex priority and the Invoice is $ 98.00. The staff in this hotel is awful.  This was our second time at this hotel but never again!!,Aug 7| 2019,3
I had an OK experience at this hotel.  The location is great and very convenient.  The Staff were friendly| but somewhat misinformed.  There are also only 2 elevators to service a very large building so leaving and returning is often a little challenging.  What I really had issues with were the following: 1) Whatever they were using to clean/not clean my room with caused me to have an allergic reaction and I ended up with allergic conjunctivitis| and I had to get eye drops for. 2) I had asked for an early morning wake up call.  I had seen the girl write it down the night before| but the call never came.  3) Upon leaving the hotel| I was told that no one could get me a taxi| and so at 3:30am in the morning| I as a single female had to work to 3rd Avenue with my bags to flag down a taxi by myself. I was scared.  I travel all over the world and stay in all kinds of accommodations| and this was the first time I had to get my own taxi cab like this in the middle of the night. Especially| after being told that there would no problem in getting me a taxi at that hour.,Aug 6| 2019,3
LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION! Convenient to anywhere of Manhattan.,Aug 6| 2019,5
Upon my arrival after checking I saw the bell hop jump to help a guy who drove up in a cab 15 minute after me and when I asked him about it he stated he did not see me...come NYC parked directly in front of the hotel with baggage? went to get ice out of the machine on floor 22 told I would have to go to floor 18 to get ice which the second day it was broken so no ice on a 90 degree day| there were people waiting 15 to 20 minutes for the elevator who finally decided to walk the 15 or so floors instead| I have been in plenty of hotels but come on this is Manhattan!!!!,Aug 5| 2019,1
Hotel staff was very nice.  We needed directions to our destinations and the staff was right on as far as what subway to take and where to transfer to get on a different line.  Internet was fast| free computer and copy machine was convienent.,Aug 4| 2019,5
Everything was good room just needed more towels. Location good.,Jul 31| 2019,4
Friendly and helpful staff. We were allowed to check in early which was great. Liked the safety of having to use your room card to operate the elevator. Convenient to subway entrance and walkable to many places.,Jul 31| 2019,5
I usually NEVER write reviews but hopefully this can stop someone from staying here and being robbed by the own hotel EMPLOYEES. We stayed here only 1 night and during the time we were gone they got into our luggage and took out $700 worth of jewelry!! First time this ever happens to me| ever! We filed a report on Saturday| July 27 and the manager was suppose to get back to me the very next day and it is July 31 and he hasn't. I've called multiple times and left voicemails and nothing. I am NOT a picky person but this is just unacceptable. DO NOT STAY HERE.,Jul 31| 2019,1
Clean room| quiet room| nice staff.  Hotel near a restaurant and not too far from bus stop.,Jul 31| 2019,4
Location was great| rooms are clean| bathrooms are somehow updated.      I would definitely stay here again.,Jul 31| 2019,5
Jacqueline was amazing!!! She made my stay!,Jul 31| 2019,5
The location is excellent and I love the coffee in the AM and the ice water in the afternoons.,Jul 30| 2019,5
Double rooms with comfy QUEEN beds which is a huge plus!  All staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was excellent. Decent location in east midtown| very walkable to many spots. Will stay again!,Jul 29| 2019,5
Completely fraudulent and deceptive pictures and room size descriptions on line. This is NOT a normal HGI room - it is like sleeping in a closet you can barely walk in if you have a suitcase. Staff is unfriendly and hostile if you complain about getting a decent size room.,Jul 28| 2019,1
Amazing time in New York. Great location,Jul 28| 2019,5
No A/C ON THE HALLS| room super small. No Refrigertor| didnt work,Jul 28| 2019,1
Loved the hotel and restaurant| very convenient to Sloan Kettering Hospital. The beds were so comfortable and the room was amazing! We were on the top floor (28) with a beautiful city view. From check in to check out this hotel was great. We booked last minute the morning of our trip| with a wonderful hotels.com member rate.,Jul 23| 2019,5
Everyone was so nice and accommodating.  Even the housekeepers were so sweet| gave me a water bottle because it was so hot on my way to check out.,Jul 21| 2019,5
Staff was very helpful| room was clean-would definitely stay again,Jul 21| 2019,5
Very pleasant! The front desk staff was exceptional| very professional and friendly.,Jul 20| 2019,5
I needed a hotel with two queen beds which can be hard to find in mid-town Manhattan. The hotel is in a great location and the staff was helpful.,Jul 20| 2019,5
Staff were very friendly. The room was very beautiful and clean. Breakfast taste so good ! I recommend everyone to go there,Jul 20| 2019,5
Great staff and clean facility.Smaller building but great location.,Jul 16| 2019,4
Great location| comfortable room and helpful and efficient staff (Kevin was wonderful and he gave us some great dining recommendations). All in all a great experience.,Jul 16| 2019,5
Overall is Satisfied staff are friendly location is good,Jul 16| 2019,4
Loved this place. We walked to most attractions from the hotel.,Jul 11| 2019,5
Firstly| we waited for around 10 minutes in the reception for the checkin| and there is only one staff in the reception and he was handling some problems in a phonecall.Secondly| they did not tell me the bottles of water in my room is subject to charge| and I stayed in another Hilton in Manhattan| the bottle of water in room is FREE.Thirdly| I stayed for three nights| there were some noise constantly happen during midnight| I dont know it is the machine or what| just annoying. And the sound proof is not good too| I can always hear the next room was arguing some issue during midnight.Overall| I could not say good of my stay| it might be just OK.,Jul 6| 2019,3
I’ve stayed at other Hiltons before and they were better in terms of size and newness.  I love the fact that they have water for us in the lobby,Jul 5| 2019,3
It was a little dated but very comfortable.  Bed was comfy and hotel was clean,Jul 1| 2019,5
I love that the hotel has a great bar and restaurant| it is very conveniently located and has great access to the city.,Jun 30| 2019,5
Good and convenient location| not too far many nice places however the location is the highlight of this hotel. The room was by far the smallest one I have ever seen. Furniture is outdated| cracked at places and cries to be replaced. Bed was ok but pillows cery uncomfortable. Walls so thin that I woke up when an alarm in other room went off. What amazes me is that their wifi is hacked. Every second time I tried to connect my Windows would detect that I am being connected to weird digital print that often contained explicit words. Overpriced for what it offers.Would not stay here again.,Jun 29| 2019,4
Good beds. Good locations. Subway| shops and restaurants nearby. But... the toilet faucet has a squeaky handle and stiff. Reported since the first day we checked in and it hasn’t been fixed till the day we checked out. We stayed 4 nights here. Other than that| it’s alll good.,Jun 26| 2019,4
Convenience Loud music lobby areaFront desk personnel loud and not very professional Felt like take o leave attitude Won’t be backOutside street fresh pavement ( taxi area ) a little bit of sand will prevent shoes from being glue to surface,Jun 25| 2019,3
A very nice hotel with perfect location in the heart of Manhatten and very friendly staff.,Jun 25| 2019,5
Great staff! Great service! Great location!,Jun 24| 2019,5
We came by car.The valet service was very good.The hotel is clean| the breakfast was good and the location was very convenient.,Jun 23| 2019,5
I'd like the place is in the middle of everything | a one block is the metro station # 6 which connected with any metro in the area and down there was a mini shopping centerEvery morning we had coffee and chocolate and after that cold water whit fruit anytime of the day| everything was set in the Lobby|  very convenient .,Jun 23| 2019,5
We really enjoyed the location in midtown east.  Walkable to so much and subway access a few blocks away! It was clean and neat. Always a friendly staff willing to give us ideas/suggestions anytime we asked.,Jun 19| 2019,5
Ice machine broken. We called down for ice multiple times| but they never actually came up. Tv also didnt work,Jun 13| 2019,2
Great location! Close to everything| especially the subway.,Jun 12| 2019,5
Great location and comfortable stay.,Jun 11| 2019,5
Good hotel| in a not so good location. Jackeline in the front desk was awesome .,Jun 11| 2019,4
Nothing and the lobby coffee quality was poor. This place was nothing special.,Jun 10| 2019,3
When I happened to try checking in another Hilton Garden Inn| the reception staff gave me a bottle of water as I sweated too much.,Jun 7| 2019,3
The staff was very kind - there was an issue with my room| and it needed to be fixed - they took care of me for my troubles| and handled it with class.  The room was great| the breakfast was great too,Jun 7| 2019,5
The staff was very nice and pleased| ready to help and almost all of them were perfect fit for the job. It just had one very rude old lady on the front desk that didn’t care about treating us nice| she speaks Spanish| I don’t remember her name| besides that| we had no problems.,Jun 2| 2019,5
It was noisy outside due to construction and traffic.   Woke up few times at night.  Other than that| it was a good place.,May 30| 2019,4
What can I say other than it was wonderful. We got there early and where given an early check-in at no extra charge. The people where friendly no matter the time of day. And I must say those where some of the fastest elevators we've ever been in. The ice machine on our floor was not working but there was a sign posted with the location of the next available one. All in all 5stars. We can't wait to visit again. Thank u,May 30| 2019,5
Unfortunately this is a high rise building with too many floors and insufficient elevator service.,May 28| 2019,3
Downtown but not right in the centre of things. Easy access to everything via subway. Lots of restaurants near by.,May 26| 2019,5
Location was great nice breakfast|  staff was helpful,May 24| 2019,5
An Elevator was not working at all.  Very delayed elevator service.,May 24| 2019,4
Location was perfect. Staff was friendly and helpful.,May 22| 2019,5
The hotel overbooked our 1st night| so we did not have the terrace room we paid for. However| the staff the next day was amazing & got us into our reserved room. The staff was very helpful| friendly & accommodating.,May 22| 2019,5
Staff was very friendly and location was great. The only thing I did not care for is the hotel only had 2 elevators. Sometimes it would take a while to come.,May 21| 2019,4
The room is too small| very cramped.Carpets need to be replaced| they do not look clean.,May 20| 2019,3
Rooms on the Small side| but otherwise fine especially considering the Pricepoint,May 20| 2019,4
Jackie | who checked us in| went out of way on our behalf.  She never forgot our names the enire 3 da ys we were there.  The staff overall was excellent.,May 6| 2019,5
breakfast cooked food was so so and i regretted ordering and paying extra for the hot food items,May 1| 2019,4
Liked having coffee/tea or water in the lobby.  Staff pleasant.  Great location.,Apr 29| 2019,5
Very close restaurants and not too crowded as the Times Sqare area.,Apr 28| 2019,5
$100 for early check in| $10 for package handling. That's on top of the $380 room rate. Do yourself a favor and stay elsewhere.,Apr 26| 2019,1
Great location| helpful friendly staff and nice restaurant,Apr 24| 2019,5
Good location| friendly helpful staff,Apr 24| 2019,4
Property was easy to get to.Staff was very friendly.Area was great.,Apr 16| 2019,5
The restaurant served food that was exceptionally good. This was unexpected. The staff was nice and very helpful,Apr 14| 2019,5
Its near the train station one minute walk| near one of the best Bagel ESSA Bagel / Panda Express/ CVS Pharmacy. Staff is customer oriented. We have few demands And so nice to give it to us. Is a small hotel so definitely all you needs will be attended.  And the place is near the police station so it is very very safe.,Apr 10| 2019,5
The beds were very comfortable and the shower was great! I wish the restaurant would have stayed open later.,Apr 8| 2019,4
Easy check in!  Nice property.  Admittedly| a little far from major tourist spots with 3 small kids in tow.,Apr 8| 2019,5
Price and proximity to all main sites in midtown/manhattan. Great restaurant..great waitresses. Lobby is beautiful. Fire place to stay warm. Rooms had everything we needed. And beds were sooo comfortable.,Apr 7| 2019,5
I stay here when I go up to visit my nephew. Hotel is alway clean| everything works. Staff is friendly| professional and helpful. Location for me is great.,Apr 1| 2019,5
Staff very nice|helpful| professional.Hotel is very clean. Very close to  2nd  and 3rd Ave,Apr 1| 2019,5
I liked that there was ice water in the lobby in the evening.  I wish that the ice water had also been available in the morning| for people who don't drink coffee or tea.  One of the elevators was out of service for awhile one day| making for long waits.  It was fixed promptly.,Apr 1| 2019,4
Pro: Good value - lowest cost for the immediate vicinity.  I also appreciated the security feature of requiring a key card to use the elevator.Con:  it was difficult to walk in the small space between the large desk chair and the bed. I suggest swapping out the full-sized desk chair for one without arms so it can be fully pushed into the desk when not in use| thereby provdiing more room to walk by the bed.,Mar 30| 2019,4
Good hotel that was in the perfect location for us.  From a comfort and usability standpoint there were a couple of minor negative points.  The shower was designed by someone who apparently never used a shower.  The location of the controls relative to the entry was ridiculous.  In addition the controls were very difficult to adjust.  The bed frame had sharp edges.  Be careful at night!  Very clean and the staff was very competent.,Mar 29| 2019,4
Very good location . Hotel had best assisting staff!,Mar 28| 2019,5
The elevator is audible all night even when it's not beside the room. The sheets are incredibly rough--I've never noticed sheet quality until this stay--they literally caused friction burns from turning at night. Clean and good location| with free WiFi in the room| but comfort and quiet are the price.,Mar 28| 2019,3
Beds have wooden frame with sharp corners.  Bumped into corners several times as room was not large.Shower was wonderful| but bed was worn.Appreciated water/coffee in lobby.,Mar 27| 2019,4
Great Staff| clean hotel and GREAT location. We will be recommending this hotel to others.,Mar 27| 2019,5
Nice place! Smaller than expected but we had a great stay!,Mar 25| 2019,4
Bathrooms not properly cleaned| carpets are old and dated.,Mar 25| 2019,4
I liked the location| but didn’t like that the elevator was right off of my room and had to listen to it all night.  I suspect this is the case for many of their rooms due to how the hotel was constructed.,Mar 22| 2019,4
Reserved a double Queen and they said it was not guaranteed and they would normally have to charge me extra.   They ended up not charging extra.  Frustrating to even have to discuss it when on expedia the option chosen was double queen.,Mar 20| 2019,2
Nice to have two queen beds in Manhattan for me and my family sharing one room!,Mar 14| 2019,5
Staff was so friendly and very helpful with information about New York.oue son was in the solan letting hospital and the staff was great at changing our rooms at time thank you,Mar 14| 2019,5
Overpriced but under delivers. Had to "reboot" the room key and the excuse was that it was a two night stay. Never heard that before. Didn't want to accept cash for the mini store items. Wanted it on credit card for incidentals. Restaurant service was horrible. Couldn't produce receipt of any type at check out. I'll be choosing another hotel for my next visit.,Mar 11| 2019,3
Their parking policy is disappointed. It's super expensive (65$ US) and the worst thing is you can't even get IN / get OUT  as you want. Which mean once you pay that 65$US.. If you want to take your car to do your things during the day and come back to the hotel... It will be another 65$ US. Total rip off in my opinion.Unfortunately | I was a bit disgusted by the fact that two small towels wasn't clean and it smells like old coffee ... therefore we put them aside..... The room is extremely small dont get fool by their picture.Other than that| for a one night staying..it was okay. nothing more.Wouldn't come back because  it didn't fit our needs during our roadtrip.(parking issue) ..The staff is friendly.,Mar 8| 2019,3
Loved the fridge and microwave in the room. The room we were in was tight not much walking space.,Mar 7| 2019,5
The location was central to most of our activities| the staff was friendly| accommodating and knowledgeable of surrounding neighborhood.,Mar 7| 2019,4
Courteous staffs having a 'can-do' attitude| clean| cozy and quiet room with a firm/nice bed| reasonable price (in terms of NYC) and location which give you tons of good eats| activities and access. Two slight down sides were slow drainage of the faucet and long waiting time for the elevator.,Mar 6| 2019,5
Property was in a good location| it was clean| staff was excellent! It was just small| especially the room!,Mar 4| 2019,5
I clicked "unhappy with Check In" by mistake.  I was very happy with the process.Hotel was clean and the employees were wonderful and very attentive.,Mar 4| 2019,5
The room was very comfortable. They didn’t have included breakfast,Mar 2| 2019,4
Gorgeous| fully equipped rooms. No detail left unimagined. Great value for money.,Mar 2| 2019,5
Excellent option for people that would not spend much time in the room.,Mar 1| 2019,4
The rooms were clean| sleek and felt luxurious.  The staff were incredibly friendly| helpful and response!  I will definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone| especially with the great price we booked through Expedia.,Feb 26| 2019,5
Good place good service,Feb 23| 2019,5
Tiffany at the front desk made our stay extra enjoyable with great recommendations and a friendly smile!,Feb 21| 2019,5
there was a cold draft at my breakfast table I think coming from above. not very nice.,Feb 19| 2019,4
Good,Feb 16| 2019,4
Ms. Jacqueline was AMAZING! All of the staff was friendly and spoke anytime they saw a guest. They were on top of clean new towels and sheets and even gave extras. It was one of the best stays I’ve ever had in a hotel and I travel a good amount a year!,Feb 14| 2019,5
Was very impressed with the customer service. Had an issue with the microwave in our room and they immediately came and took care of it. Front desk employees were accommodating| helpful and friendly. We had no complaints at all. Thank you,Feb 11| 2019,5
Very convienent location for us. Clean room| friendly staff and a restaurant on site made this a pleasant stay.,Feb 11| 2019,5
The staff was very friendly. Room was nice and comfortable with enough amenities to make staying comfortable,Feb 11| 2019,5
I had to move to another room because there was no tub in my original room. Not happy i had to pay more for another room,Feb 10| 2019,2
Great hotel with all amenities except full biz center. Well trained friendly staff with few exceptions.,Feb 10| 2019,4
Bed was nasty with hair and bottle waters $3.00 and bathroom no heat very cold,Feb 10| 2019,2
The staff were great! Upon checking| the staff upgraded the room,Feb 4| 2019,5
Perfect location for our needs and a very attentive| accommodating staff. I’d stay here again no question!,Feb 3| 2019,5
Great place. Staff is fantastic. Heating broke so we had people in and out which was annoying when we only had one night.,Feb 3| 2019,4
No complimentary water. Charging $3.00 per bottle purchased. Our room wasn’t cleaned after the first night| told front desk & all they did was bring sheets up for us to change ourselves. Very disappointed,Feb 3| 2019,2
Great location- close to subway| within walking distance to Times Square| staff very friendly and helpful,Feb 1| 2019,5
The key room never worked we coudn’t leave the hotel cause each key we get dosn’t work,Jan 31| 2019,1
Room was very clean| including the bathroom. Bed was clean and well made| if a little hard for my taste.  Pillows were plump and clean. Entire staff was friendly and helpful. Would stay there again.,Jan 30| 2019,5
Great location between 2 very useful subway stations.  Rooms are clean| comfortable| and large by NYC standards.  The afternoon cookies are a nice touch too.,Jan 29| 2019,5
This told me that my room was paid in full and then added an additional charge on my bill. I did not use any items that were in the room and no damage was done so i should not have had any additional charges. I called in about it and i was hung up on. I will not be reccommending this location.,Jan 29| 2019,1
Front desk people friendly and helpful. Always smiling and very attentive!,Jan 28| 2019,5
Check in was very easy and fast.  The room was a bit old and couldn't move around.  The king size bed took up most of the room. Coffee was served in the lobby with was nice,Jan 26| 2019,3
It was an ok place. The rooms were definitely smalller than it appeared in the photos. It must have been booked| because the lobby was frequently crowded and the elevators took a long time.,Jan 23| 2019,3
Very close to public transportation| full service restaurant downstairs plus a mini store for soft drinks and snacks. My room was clean| temperature control was great on a very cold NY evening| staff was professional.  I will definitely use this hotel again.,Jan 22| 2019,4
Nice size room and was very clean.  Staff was friendly and the cost was very reasonable.,Jan 22| 2019,5
Front staff very friendly. close to shops| restaurants. clean and modern Would definitely stay again,Jan 22| 2019,5

Great location and great value. Great amenities too.,Jan 9| 2019,5
We found exactly what we were looking for for a four-night stay in Manhattan| one adult with two teenagers. The two-queen room was sufficient in size| the mini-fridge and microwave a plus for a quick breakfast "in". The beds were comfortable. The bathroom was good and well-maintained. And it was amazingly quiet at night. The only thing to keep in mind is that there are only two elevators for this smallish hotel with 28 floors| so there can be a wait during "rush hours".,Jan 8| 2019,4
After a nice night out| came into a friendly staff that got me check-in to my room. The room was clean and the beds where actually nice. I actually check-in really late so the staff gave me a late check-out as well. Will come back to this hotel when i visit NY again,Jan 7| 2019,5
Great service and clean!,Jan 6| 2019,5
Excellent Location| Clean| Excellent service ........,Jan 3| 2019,5
The room is too small for a family. If you are alone| it would be fine.,Jan 2| 2019,3
I stayed away this hotel because I had planned on taking my daughter to Radio City and and visit the tree.  The price wasn't bad. Overall it was Ok and not sure I would go back again. Please know you have to pay for breakfast at the hotel which was very expensive. We decided to get McDonald's instead.,Dec 30| 2018,3
I love Hilton hotels | only one thing you should guys work at to have girls work at breakfast section just to smile and be little bit helpful | other than that | thank you again for having me there and treating me good .,Dec 27| 2018,5
It was good under the location of midtown. If have a bathtab| will be much great!,Dec 23| 2018,4
Great location| easy check in. Quiet rooms and well located,Dec 22| 2018,5
Place was amazing I would strongly recommend staying here.  Quick walk tk everything;,Dec 22| 2018,5
You get what you pay for. Room was nice and location was ideal to the activities we planned to do. Staff were amazing and very helpful.,Dec 19| 2018,4
While the hotel did not have a grand lobby like other midtown eastside hotels| it did have free coffee and cookies daily and was very welcoming. The rooms were well appointed with Mini fridge| microwave and coffee maker.,Dec 18| 2018,5
It's clean| it's well located| it's just dated. The staff was super nice. Big plus!,Dec 17| 2018,3
Management was great,Dec 16| 2018,5
I found the location excellent. The property was under welling.  Somewhwhat drab. Unimpressive,Dec 16| 2018,3
Good location.,Dec 13| 2018,4
2nd time staying. Overall very good accommodation and friendly staff,Dec 13| 2018,5
Overall experience was great. I have no complaints thank you for all the great quality services and experience.,Dec 10| 2018,5
The location was great. I found it very clean & I liked the size as well. It was not too large.I commute to NY weekly & I was surprised at the price but it was high everywhere unfortunately!Thank you,Dec 8| 2018,5
Absolutely delighted with all the staff and the hotel.  Everyone was so accommodating and helpful.  Hotel is very comfortable and a great location for enjoying the NY sights.  Walking distance to some and easy Uber trips to others (other than the NY traffic).,Dec 5| 2018,5
$132 for the room| $150(!) for the dog and $97(!) for parking. Stay away!! We won’t be back. Very disappointed,Dec 4| 2018,1
our room you can here all the noise outside day and night but the staff are very helpfull & housekeeping are great.,Dec 2| 2018,4
Small room but 2 queen beds are a plus! Good midtown location.,Dec 2| 2018,4
Everyone was great. The staff was very friendly and the room was clean.,Dec 2| 2018,5
We actually really enjoyed the room and cocktails down in the bar. But having only one operating elevator for 28 floors is unacceptable. It was such a long wait that we missed our train and the elevator my sister was on was awful due to a fight that ensued because of the delays. I wouldn’t stay there again just because of that. I understand that things happen but they knew the day before that it was broken and it should have been addressed then.,Nov 29| 2018,2
Its a tiny hotel but overall it was nice| and its not as far as I though it will be.,Nov 28| 2018,4
Great location| very friendly staff. Very fast check in,Nov 27| 2018,5

We visited NY for a long weekend of site-seeing and entertainment. The Hilton Garden Inn was well located for all our excursions in Midtown Manhattan. Most destinations were within walking distance or a quick Uber ride. The hotel staff was very friendly and worked to make our stay comfortable. The room was clean but relatively small.,Nov 19| 2018,4
Not a good experience. Very noisy rooms| hectic parking experience| street construction  in front of the hotel entrance| dirty shower.,Nov 19| 2018,2
Hotel staff was very helpful and courteous. Great place to stay.,Nov 16| 2018,5
Room was really clean| and everything was laid out well.  Desk was a good size| and good access to plugs.  Solid wifi connectivity.  Comfortable bed.  Bathroom was a good size.  And very friendly staff.  Everyone was so nice| from the front desk staff to everyone working the floors and rooms.,Nov 15| 2018,5
short walk to subway| beautiful view of skyscrapers| 16 th floor|? clean room.  nice pillows| hot water| I highly recommend this hotel.  approx $250 per night including tax,Nov 13| 2018,5
We would definitely stay again.  Very clean room and Friendystaff,Nov 12| 2018,5
Everything was very nice during our stay. We only had trouble with our shower getting water on the floor outside of the tub. Seemed to be a problem with the way the inner curtain was attached.When our son| who had run the marathon needed some ice to take an ice bath| the restaurant provided us a bag of ice for no charge.Everyone was cordial and professional.We will stay again when we come up to visit family.,Nov 11| 2018,4
Nice hotel very close to subway| a lot of museums and shops and restaurants. Very clean and best of all| very quiet!! Didn’t hear any neighbors or elevators while sleeping. Parking is a lot so we parked elsewhere.,Nov 11| 2018,4
Great location. Very accommodating and helpful. The guy in the lobby even hailed a cab for us. The only negative was $75 a night to park your car and $3 bottled water. The hotel was clean and safe. Free coffee| water and cookies in the lobby. I would definitely return.,Nov 10| 2018,5
Good overall experience. However| it would be nice if the hotel informed in advance that the 2 bottles of water during house keeping required additional charges. I wouldn’t mind paying for the water but at least let the customer know what they are getting.,Nov 10| 2018,4
Hotel was very clean| quiet rooms| very friendly staff| good food.,Nov 6| 2018,5

Great location for Midtown Manhattan business travel at reasonable price.,Oct 15| 2018,4
A great hotel in a great location with a super staff!  The staff could not have be friendlier or more helpful - directing us through the subways and to wonderful local restaurants.The hotel is 1/2 a few yards from the subway stop and tons of great bars and restaurants on 2nd Avenue. The room was nice and clean. The breakfast was OK.,Oct 9| 2018,5
This was the worst hotel experience of my life. The noise from the elevator cables| sheaves and electrical solenoids was like being put in a box with someone using a sledge hammer and hammering the walls of the room.  It was impossible to sleep.  It would appear that they have neglected doing elevator maintenance for a long time. I will never go back there.,Oct 8| 2018,1
Friendly staff| small but comfortable room| great location| and food available in lobby. I recommend this hotel!,Oct 7| 2018,5
we come to NYC for my childs medical treatment.  The staff was so helpful making sure we had a ride to the airport in time with rain.  That kind of help means more to us than most other people.  Its hard enough dealing with everything else that these little things are big. I don't think they know our situation so this is how they treat everyone.,Sep 30| 2018,5
Clean rooms| lovely staff| relatively quiet location.,Sep 25| 2018,4

A lovely hotel close to Times Square and the Subway to get to anywhere in Manhattan. The staff are very friendly and eager to help with any problems. The room is well furnished with USB charging ports| large TV with local channels and free wifi. Would highly recommend.,Sep 9| 2018,5
We booked this hotel in October 2017| a whole 11 months prior to going on holiday.  Why ?  Because we wanted certain rooms.  The trip was to help celebrate a wedding anniversary and would be our only trip together to New York so we wanted it to be special.  We booked a room with a balcony and full length windows.  Expensive but we wanted something to remember.  When I booked the hotel last year I noticed the room still on sale on the Expedia website.  I e mailed the manager of the hotel who replied saying "I see the reservation and the room assignment that you mentioned. I guess I am a little confused as to the question. The room is confirmed."  When we arrived and checked in the lady on reception called a cleaner and then gave us our room keys.  We went to our room and noticed it was a standard double.  We went down to reception and spoke to the lady plus the manager ( the same guy who e mailed me a year ago ) who told me the room was booked for tonight but we could have it from tomorrow.  We were ( and still are ) fuming. Had we not gone downstairs would we be told it was occupied already ?  Why was it occupied when we booked so far ahead ? Where we ever to be told or where they hoping to 'get away with it' ?  It ruined the start of a supposed magical trip. We had to move rooms to the one we paid for the next day.  Now I haven't been refunded for the extra we paid for that room and had no compensation.  The service is appallingly bad.  How can this possibly happen ?,Sep 7| 2018,3
Wonderful experience will be back soon thank you so much,Sep 5| 2018,5
Terrible room service I have ever had. They brought a food that was burnt.,Sep 3| 2018,1
Very clean. Very comfortable bed! A/C was lovely. Shower was wonderful. Great location. All for a great price. Can’t go wrong staying here.,Aug 28| 2018,5
The street was quiet and removed from the hustle and bustle.  The bed was very comfortable and the staff were friendly| especially for New York.,Aug 27| 2018,4
Wow! This hotel was so above and beyond! I interacted with at least 15-20 employees and Everyone was very helpful and very nice always wishing us a great day and safe travels. Really enjoyed our stay. Great gym and very clean. Lobby really nice with coffee in the morning and cookies in the afternoon :),Aug 26| 2018,5
Room sevice was on point| staff was very friendly. Room was small but that’s common in Manhattan. Decent hair dryer. Great view. Love the local area| lot’s of places to get food nearby. The valet even packed my luggage into my car for me while I was getting breakfast.,Aug 26| 2018,4
Everyone was very kind and welcoming,Aug 25| 2018,5
Great location - very quiet.  Rooms small. Breakfast much too expensive but overall a good choice,Aug 22| 2018,4
excellent location| all staff from front desk to cleaning and maintenance extremely friendly and courteous,Aug 22| 2018,5
Very helpful Terri. All the ladies at front desk are great!!!Wonderful experience😘,Aug 21| 2018,5
We enjoyed the proximity to a number of attractions| stores and restaurants. The staff and lobby were always welcoming!,Aug 20| 2018,4
Great location if you are a first time visitor to NYC.  Easy to get to all the major sites in Manhattan by walking or subway.  Staff was very helpful with subway directions.  If you are coming from LaGuardia| take a cab.  We took their recommended SuperShuttle to the hotel and a cab back to the airport.  The cab was much faster and about $10 cheaper.,Aug 20| 2018,4
In all honesty| we thought we had booked the Hilton Garden 8th Ave.  We were distraught at the unfeeling clerk who told us it happens a thousand times every day| "see ya 'round".  Then my daughter discovered that the E train leads right from Time Square to the Hilton at 2nd/52nd.  This hotel was the best we've ever used in dozens of trips to New York.  Quiet| clean| spacious| convenient & 10 minute subway to theatre district.  We will never stay anywhere else.,Aug 14| 2018,5
Comfortable beds| nice view| great location. Super clean.,Aug 13| 2018,5
Nice| clean| friendly staff.  Great location! And very quiet at night  in the middle of midtown| which is hard to find!,Aug 13| 2018,5
Downtown location but not too crazy busy. Very friendly and also quiet.,Aug 12| 2018,5
Room was clean| but a little tight.  Had to move the chair from the desk to move around the room.,Aug 8| 2018,4
Good central position| walked to Central Park and Times Square| although I do like walking and taxis may be more appropriate for the less active. Great street market nearby on Sunday,Aug 6| 2018,5
Note: I don't do surveys - but this place gets a BIG THUMBS UP!!!   Clean| well maintained| great room sizes for NYC| very quiet and relaxing| AMAZINGLY FRIENDLY STAFF (Jamal at the front desk ROCKS!!!) Great choices of places to eat nearby| close to subway entrances| well lit streets at night|  I will definitely choose this location to stay in again.,Jul 26| 2018,5
Excellent service from staff| lovely room with great view. Would definitely return.,Jul 25| 2018,5
Really liked the location. The room was nice and clean  but a little bit small.,Jul 25| 2018,5
Hotel is under construction. No mention of it prior to check in. The road in front was under construction| loud noises inside and outside of building. Also elevators didn’t work for a lot of the stay. Very disappointed in a Hilton quality hotel,Jul 23| 2018,1
The hotel was very clean and extremely well maintained. the location was also quite and safe. The staff were exceptionally  professional| friendly and considerate-they made our stay really worthwhile.,Jul 18| 2018,5
I loved everything about the hotel except the resturant| i thought the standards were not fit for a Hilton hotel. The service was not up to swatch. Otherwise i enjoyed my stay overall.,Jul 16| 2018,4
Great location | clean| good neighbourhood|  close to great food and lots to do. Only reason not 5 stars| no pool $65.00 for parking a day| and no free complimentary water.,Jul 12| 2018,4
Nice| clean rooms. Great service,Jul 7| 2018,5
Very nice hotel| room was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful.  Only complaint was the elevators were tough to get| especially during busy times.  However not that big a deal.,Jul 6| 2018,4
Good spot| good service| room was pretty small but nice,Jul 2| 2018,4
Was visiting for only a single night. Found the location to be good plus the staff at the reception desk were welcoming.,Jul 2| 2018,4
Great girls trip with my oldest daughter (13).,Jun 28| 2018,5
Nice hotel| located very conveniently to visit Manhattan| with a great value for money!,Jun 26| 2018,5
nice hotel only think i didn't like they have no parking lot,Jun 12| 2018,4
Darrin made sure we got rooms close together even though I had made the reservations with two different names and forgot! He made it right. Very helpful staff| from the luggage storage to the valet parking.,Jun 11| 2018,5
Cool place but if you take the bottle water they place in the room you will be charged for it lol. It’s not free lol,Jun 11| 2018,4
Typical midtown Manhattan mid-level hotel.  Nothing special| nothing bad.  I did not take advantage of any of the amenities. Used the wi-fi| slept in the bed| showered and left the next morning.,Jun 9| 2018,4
Excellent location! Really comfy queen size beds (rare to find in NYC) and great pillows!  Nice staff! Clean!!!   Room was ready at NOON!,Jun 9| 2018,5
My daughter and her friends stayed here after Governor's Ball 2018,Jun 7| 2018,4
Chose this hotel specifically because of the queen beds. One review said they weren't queen; they are 60 inches wide so they are. Clean| comfortable beds| quiet| close to the Lex/53rd stop. Small rooms but that's what you get in Manhattan unless you spend big bucks. Had a city view which was very nice so I can't speak to the other views.,Jun 6| 2018,5
Room was clean but Bed was very uncomfortable| cheap mattress.,Jun 5| 2018,3
Hilton Garden Inn Midtown East is a no frills hotel| but it has the basics in  a superb centrally located midtown area at an affordable price.  The rooms are clean albeit small.  For the value conscious traveler| it is a good choice.,Jun 4| 2018,4
Everything was excellent!,May 30| 2018,5
There were ants in the room. I told the front desk and they handed me a Starbucks gift card...,May 29| 2018,2
It was a great location and we enjoyed ourselves. The beds could use an upgrade I think. A little firm and lumpy. The hallways where the rooms are and the rooms th ma loves are pretty small but I imagine that’s typical for most manhattan hotels. But otherwise great service and location.,May 29| 2018,4
Front desk need some welcoming training....,May 22| 2018,2
Needed a place to stay overnight and this place was located in a convienient place for us.,May 13| 2018,5
Sorry couldn't get early check-in. Room cramped. Otherwise ok. Convenient location.,May 12| 2018,3
There were holes in the towels. Really disappointing considering I paid $500 to stay here to find that the towels were cheap| small and had holes in them.,May 9| 2018,4
We had a wonderful stay in April--despite the fact that it felt more like November!  The staff was very pleasant and accommodating.  We arrived in the city several hours before our room would be ready| but we were able to leave our luggage there while we began our sightseeing.  We were able to store them again after we checked out since we had most of the day to explore before our train would arrive.  The hotel is close enough to walk to Rockefeller Center and Times Square| but is away from the hubbub so is not too noisy.  The room was clean and comfortable for our family of 4.  Overall| it was a great place to stay and we will be back!,Apr 25| 2018,5
Covienient and clean. Would definitely stay again.,Apr 19| 2018,5
Very pleasant-no surprises just what I expected-no less,Apr 16| 2018,5
Staff really helpful with directions took time with maps. Kuerig coffee maker in room made really good coffee which was very much appreciated for this coffee lover. Umbrellas were put in the lobby on cloudy rainy days which I thought was very considerate. Overall enjoyed my stay. The elevator slow response is the only complaint.,Apr 15| 2018,5
The Hilton Garden Inn located on 52nd Street was great. I booked this hotel kind of last minute| and was very pleased with my stay. I arrived a little before check-in time and my room was ready and in great shape. I've stayed in a few hotels in NYC| and this one felt more spacious than some of the others (relatively speaking). Bed was super comfortable| chair to sit was a nice touch| bathroom was very spacious. It's in a great location right next to the subway but also easily walkable to other areas of Manhattan. The staff were friendly and attentive - they also kept my bag for the entire day after I had checked out since I was seeing a show. I only stayed for one night| but had a great experience - I'll definitely be back here,Apr 9| 2018,5
The rooms were nice but small and they were not to spacious and there was also some problem with the Wi-Fi it wasn't working.,Apr 8| 2018,4
Good for a short trip ............................,Apr 5| 2018,4
This is a comfortable hotel with rather large rooms. The staff was friendly and the lobby was welcoming and comfortable. It’s located close to all of the action in the city but not right in the middle of it| and there’s a subway station right around the corner. I’d definitely stay here again.,Apr 4| 2018,5
This hotel charged my card for the entire amount before I had even checked it. I had planned to use a different card. Annoying!! Other than that| room was very nice| staff very friendly and food in their restaurant was delicious.,Apr 1| 2018,4
During checkout there was only one clerk. I was "upgraded to the kings room" yet instead of a decent shower I end up having a walk in shower with a curtain that ruined the whole experience about the hotel The beds are awesome. Also. there are not enough elevators.,Mar 29| 2018,4
Hotel is clean and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this spot. Good locale and nice little gym too.,Mar 29| 2018,5
Great place to stay. Lots of things to do nearby.Staff was friendly| rooms were neat| view was good| & security was tighter with keyed elevators.,Mar 27| 2018,4
THe staff was very nice and location of hotel very convenient.  Room was a little dated.,Mar 20| 2018,4
Our one night stay in a 2 Queen bed Room was quiet and cozy. The room was clean| but small. It had a mini fridge| microwave| and complimentary WiFi. The 2 elevators were small and slow getting people up and down. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful.,Mar 18| 2018,4
We had a great experience| location is great | 300 feet from closest underground | banks are close | dining is close | great hotel,Mar 17| 2018,5
Overnight birthday stay.  Stay was good| room was comfy and clean.,Feb 26| 2018,4
Clean room. Not far from Rockefeller center. Quiet at night.,Feb 25| 2018,4
Friendly staff| on-point dining and room service. Highly recommended for the area.,Feb 23| 2018,5
The hotel was not too far from anything we wanted to see. The Uber ride from LGA airport was about $40. and  trips to around Times Square were about $10. The area was clean and had plenty of restaurants nearby. We enjoyed the Irish Pub about three doors down for a close lunch. It wasn't fancy but met all our needs.,Feb 23| 2018,4
Very convenient location. Valet parking a big plus.,Feb 20| 2018,5
Booked for a second consecutive night on Hotels.com and stayed in the same room. Left for the hospital around 1pm and took the DND sign off the door. Returned to the room around 9pm. Room had not been made up and needed new towels etc. front desk sent towels right up. Probably an oversight| no big I guess...,Feb 10| 2018,4
Great experience and good location. Clean room| comfy beds - had a great night sleep| hot shower| helpful service. Very happy with our stay and will recommend.,Feb 9| 2018,5
Cood location| quiet street and friendly staff. Likely to book again.,Feb 5| 2018,5
For a family of 3| it was the perfect location and the room was bigger than we expected for NYC. The staff were extremely friendly and even checked us in early to our room. We would certainly stay here again if we came back for another trip to the city.,Jan 30| 2018,5
Great location. Close to subway entrance. Always felt welcome.  When one elevator was not working for a couple of days| the manager personally made it up to us. Great shower with good water pressure and hot water. Comfy bed. Clean room.,Jan 30| 2018,5
Nice| well-equipped room with comfortable bed and clean bathroom. Had King size bed| fridge micro and Keurig. Too small to have a sitting area if that’s important to you. I was very pleasantly surprised given the low winter weekend rate.,Jan 29| 2018,5
Clean| wonderful pillows and very nice staff at front desk.,Jan 28| 2018,4
One elevator was down and they have only two. Imagine the chaos! But everything else was good.,Jan 28| 2018,5
Simple| clean hotel in a great location.Mid town east is the best area for subway| sights| museums| etc.The room was just large enough so as not to feel cramped.I choose it for the good value.I did not use the restaurant but I heard it was good.  Worth a try next time I visit New York City.,Jan 25| 2018,4
No light in the elevator The card not working to open the front Doors hotel Take money extra for the room No return in time,Jan 20| 2018,2
Great... The stay has been nothing short of amazing. I would recommend the hotel to my friends and family,Jan 15| 2018,4
Elevators took forever. Room was small & the amenities very below basic. The appliances in the room were dated. The bed was roomy & comfortable. The centralized area for coffee & tea continually was without the ingredients to make either.,Jan 9| 2018,3
Good business stay,Jan 9| 2018,5
Friendly helpful staff,Jan 7| 2018,4
Very  confortable  stay whit the family.  I recomend it.,Jan 7| 2018,4
Staff was friendly & helpful. Room was tidy| a hit dated but clean.,Dec 31| 2017,4
Rms weren’t ready when arrived Carpet not vacuumed Called 5 times for Pillows cases and did not get them until 11pm  and they were still wetFriendly staff but very short handed to helpCharged me for a room service delivery I did not orderTold me I could not get receipt at check out,Dec 31| 2017,3
El hotel fue muy cómodo y súper limpio lo único es el parking lot queda un bloke de retirado pero si volvería a hospedarme de nuevo,Aug 12| 2021,5
El personal fue extremadamente amable| siempre tratando de complacernos. Todas las personas en la recepción y el restaurante fueron siempre amables y buscaron acomodar todos nuestros pedidos de la mejor manera. Fui con 3 hijos adolescentes que pedían de todo a la cocina y a la recepción| estacionamos la bicicleta en la puerta y la cuidaron| nos dieron early check in y late check out| servicio a la habitación muy bueno cada vez que lo pedimos| nos buscaron taxis| nos dieron indicaciones para conocer nueva york mejor|  nos facilitaron la recepción de paquetes (recibimos muchas compras online y siempre las guardaron con mucho cuidado y nos avisaban cada vez que llegaba un paquete).Nos encantó nuestra estadía y pienso siempre volver a este hotel cada vez que vaya a Nueva York.,Aug 12| 2021,5

No hacen la limpieza de las habitaciones| te obligan a dejar un deposito pero te cargan a tu tarjeta lo que firmas| es decir te cobran doble El trato es grosero y la comida malaPésimo todo no vuelvo nunca  a este hotel Caro y malo,Jul 31| 2021,2
El hotel esta situado al frente de la estacion del metro lo que lo hace accesible a toda la ciudad| el sector es agradable y tranquilo| pero cerca a mucho sitios de interés.  El servicio de limpieza hay que programarlo| uno tiene que estar pendiente para no quedarse sin arreglo de la habitación.  Destacable el sobresaliente servicio de Casey en el front desk.,Jul 26| 2021,5
Um hotel ok. Zero serviço. Apertado como normalmente costuma ser os hotéis de NY. Café da manhã BEM sem opção e pago.,Jul 26| 2021,4

El personal muy cordial. Hablan español. Excelente ubicación.  A una cuadra estación del metro.,May 31| 2021,5
El hotel tiene muy buena ubicación| el personal es muy amable| las instalaciones están en muy buenas condiciones.Estuve 4 noches y nunca hicieron limpieza| por cuestiones de COVID| tenía que ir al lobby para cambiar toallas y pedir artículos de limpieza. Nunca sacaron la basura de la habitación. Dice incluye desayuno y lo que dan es un voucher por $10 dlls por persona. El restaurante es agradable y con buenos alimentos. En general estuvo Ok,May 18| 2021,4
Excelente,May 17| 2021,5
Me gusto la ubicación| muy cerca del metro| con vista increíble a la ciudad| debería de tener cinco estrellas| solo que está muy pequeño.,May 10| 2021,4

Betalade 1999 för ett rum med två dubbelsängar. Frukost ingick inte men det behövdes absolut inte då vi på morgonen överraskades med en pop-up foodmarket på gatan utanför. Mitt i New York kan man ta en stående frukost vart som helst. Promenadavstånd från Times Square även för en sexåring. Fint hotell för någon natts övernattning.,Aug 13| 2019,4
Mon check In a ete retardé car il y avait beaucoup de monde ( un bus de touristes) à enregistrer. Ma chambre était  tout a fait convenable| de taille respectable pour NYC| et une petite salle de douche attenante| propre. Le bureau est bien conçu pour travailler.  Les fauteuils étaient cependant un peu vieillots et peu confortables.,Jul 30| 2019,4

Hotel um pouco antigo| mas excelente localização e funcionários simpáticos e atenciosos. Sempre tinha um mimo: de manhã café e chá até às 10h| depois água com ervas ou frutas e de tarde ainda colocam uns cookies. Chuveiro excelente! O quarto era bem pequeno| mas conseguimos nos organizar para não ficar abrindo as malas. Com certeza me hospedaria aqui novamente| fica numa região muito bonita e na esquina (100 m) tem a estação do metrô com as linhas E| M e 6.,Feb 11| 2019,4

The surroundings are great and the hotel is ok for a short stay of a family of four however| the rooms are small to accommodate the luggage for a longer stay.

By far the worst customer service ever!! Never ever gotten that poor customer service! When we arrived we were given a room that was covered in hair everywhere restrooms| beds just plain nasty when I went downstairs to inform the front desk (with pictures) I was told that the was the only room with 2 beds available for the weekend and ended having to pay for a separate room just to accommodate my family 😡😡😡!!,Aug 11| 2021,1
liked location| and room sizeToo much wait for elevators| weak annoying internet connection| not enough towels changes,Aug 10| 2021,4
This hotel is very nice located between Times Square and Central Park. The rooms were spacious for NYC and had a nice shower. Convenient to MTA metro line E that brings you to JFK or La Guardia Airport.,Aug 10| 2021,5
WELL they have 3 tiny elevators for the whole hotel…. Only 1 of which worked. So it was not uncommon to have to wait 10/15minutes for an elevator - Often times when it finally came it was already full so you had to wait ANOTHER 10/15minutes. My boyfriend ended up routinely taking the stairs up and down… we were on the 22nd floor. The front desk staff is extremely understaffed. No one ever answers when I called from the in room. Made several requests for towels and never got any. Every time I needed to go to the front desk it was an extremely long wait even if there weren’t many people waiting in line. The rooms were nice though and clean| but everything else is a hot mess and really frustrating to the point where I wouldn’t stay here again…. If not for the elevator situation alone. What you get For the money you pay for these rooms isn’t worth it. I’d be willing to pay more money to stay in the same area but at a different hotel. And I’m pretty easy going.,Aug 9| 2021,2
Convenient to walk to other places great location clean outside environment,Aug 9| 2021,5
Our stay at the Hilton Garden Inn was fantastic. The room was just right. The air conditioning was cold| shower was roomy and great pressure| and refrigerator was perfect for our snacks. The location was exactly what we wanted| close to everything. Would stay here again!,Aug 8| 2021,5
Convenient location. Felt safe,Aug 6| 2021,5
The room was fine and clean. The loby smells and no one cleans your room unless you ask. If you need anything you have to ask.,Aug 6| 2021,3
We reserved two rooms. My wife could not use room key| two consecutive days. There was no clear explanation why this happened and luck of professional hospitality.,Aug 5| 2021,2
Everything was good,Aug 3| 2021,5
The room was very clean and quiet even though it was close to the elevator.  However| there was no housekeeping available.  We were made aware of this when checking in| but were told that if we needed anything| to call or ask the front desk.  We did just that| asked the person at the front desk for fresh towels and trash pick up.  We left all day| when we returned| no new towels or trash pick up.  We ended up taking the trash out to a dumpster downstairs ourselves.,Aug 3| 2021,3
The front desk staff dont answer the phone when you call with a question or request.  The tv in our room didnt work| so we called down for help…multiple times| no answer.  Finally my husband went down to the front desk where he was ignored while waiting for the front desk person to acknowledge him| even though he was the only person in the lobby. I was calling down to the front desk at the same time| and he said the guy just went back to playing with his cell phone and ignoring my calls in addition to my husband who was standing right in front of him.Eventually he was forced to acknowledge my husband| and said someone would be up to fix the tv| but 45 minutes later still no one had showed.I went down there to give him a piece of my mind and the front desk staff was totally ambivalent about the fact that we were not being taken care of.  I had to stand there at the front desk and wait until my husband upstairs texted me that the repair guy had stopped by.And then even after all that- the next time we turned the tv on| it was broken again.Totally would NOT recommend.,Aug 3| 2021,2
Great location. Easy to get to everything New York!,Aug 3| 2021,5
Staff helpful and nice. Comfortable beds and clean rooms! The Bistro attached to hotel is very good as well| with a great happy hour!,Aug 1| 2021,4
Overall| everything was okay. Staff were friendly though could be more professional. They were behaving more causally. Bathroom and bed were clean when we first went in. Both had everything needed such as towels| soaps| etc. When we checked in| the staff warned us about not giving room service unless requested during our stay. I did end up requesting for more hair shampoo on the second night. The staff gave me 2 more bottles which covered for the rest of my stay. Room size is a bit small| but I didn't mind it too much. The desk lamp light bulb was dead| but didnt need it so didn't request for a change. Microwave had a stain that I easily cleaned off. Noise level was okay. Heard my neighbor talking| unsure if that was them standing outside the door or if it was through the wall. My room door needed to be pulled shut each time when leaving the room. Elevator was okay. Fast| enough room for 6 without touching each other| but the light for level 15 didn't light up in one of them. So sometimes I was unsure if it was selected or not. The location was good. Cheap and expensive food left and right. Time square and 5th ave were only a walk away.,Aug 1| 2021,3
The hotel was in a great location| just off of Broadway and south of Central Park.  Rooms were small but comfortable| nice bathroom.  Like similar NY hotels| there were three small elevators for a very tall bldg; almost always the first elevator that stopped was already completely full. Also we checked out an wanted to check some bags to do some things before an early evening flight| was told that only two (for our party of three) would be free| there woukld be $5 charge for the other three; never had that happen before.  Pretty nice workout room.,Jul 31| 2021,4
There was always a 10-20 minute wait for the elevator. I had to ask repeatedly (more than 3 times) for someone to come to bring towels| sheets and pick up the garbage. After asking multiple times they picked up the garbage n brought towels once. My sheets were never changed as requested.,Jul 31| 2021,1
none,Jul 30| 2021,4
They gave us bad service. All carpets is dirty| there is no housekeeping service. All is self service. In short. Never make another reservation again in this Hotel.,Jul 29| 2021,1
The staff was not nice| not friendly at all| neither helpful. I asked for clean towels| I called 3 times when to the desk twice| until 8pm| they sent the towels. I did not know| they clean the rooms every 5 days| so peple left the garbage outside and maybe they will pick it up one a day or until next day. They have 3 elevators 1 didnt work| you had to wait a long time. The time to check in is at 3pm| we got to NYC at 9 am| and went to the hotel| they said the room will be ready before 3| iy was until 5:40| that they gave us the rooms. The excuse was alwaus the same. They had too much people. Not a nice experience.,Jul 28| 2021,3
I like the fact that it has self service laundry inside the property. The floor in the room has dirty spots. One of the elevators is out of order. It took sometimes 10 minutes wait before we could get in. You have to stay 5 days before someone can clean you rroom. Fridge in the room was temperature warm so it was useless. Our daughter visited once and she was told we were not on the guest list. We have been staying there for 4 days already. Just would not recommend this hotel!,Jul 27| 2021,2
Front desk staff was great. Elevators didn’t work and had to wait a long time for one| then packed in like sardines. Many young tourists from Brazil were very hostile| rude and acted uncivilized. Get a lot of rednecks from the Midwest (Michigan| etc.) and the South who visit this hotel. If u can afford to pay an extra $100 per night| better to go to a 5 star hotel then deal with the trashy behavior you will encounter from the guests here.,Jul 27| 2021,1
The only positive about this property is the location.  We arrived at 7 pm with advance reservations and 3 pm check-in time and had to wait 25 minutes for a room ‘to be cleaned’ only to be told (after I questioned what was taking so long) we were going to be put in a different room.  There was a problem with the elevators and we waited another half hour to get on an overcrowded elevator to our room.  This was the consistent experience through your three day stay.  The room was average with a decent view.  The second night I requested clean towels and additional blankets (no housekeeping/room cleaning is offered) and it took well over an hour to get them.  This hotel is woefully understaffed.  The second night I requested clean towels and more pillows and it took well over three hours to get them.I paid extra for breakfast only to find out that it consisted of going into a little room to pick three items per guest per day for breakfast.  The breakfast sandwiches looked disgusting and four  out of  five of the other items (juice| yogurt| breakfast bars) we not in stock.  Total rip-off.  We were afraid to eat the few things that were availableThe Empire Steakhouse (adjacent to hotel) was exceptional.  Ardie| our server was amazing.  If only the hotel could replicate the customer service and quality found at Empire  I don’t recommend this hotel.  I feel seriously ripped off.,Jul 27| 2021,2
It was stinky and very poor service,Jul 26| 2021,1
Good location. Need to improve the work service,Jul 26| 2021,4
Check in was a nightmare| elevators are terrible| most of the time we took the stairs. Hotel was maintained well. Area around the hotel is amazing for access to Time Square| and restaurants. Very popular area.,Jul 26| 2021,3
When we came back on our second night| our key didn’t work. The receptionist said Expedia only booked us in for one night but we were staying for 2 and paid for 2 already. He said it was Expedia’s fault and he had to charge us for a second night if we wanted to stay another night| but somehow our stuff was still in the same room? Then he “coincidentally” found my name under a “different hotel room number” and it was booked wrong on the second night| after I argued we were paid for 2 nights.,Jul 26| 2021,2
The room I stayed in was infested with fleas. I saw several jumping on my feet and legs and I was left with at least 15-20 itchy bites. It is kinda understandable since it is a pet-friendly hotel| but I would never expect them to be that bad. Other than that my experience was positive! Very friendly staff too.,Jul 25| 2021,3
No towels and bed was not changed or room cleaned. When called to request towels they said in 15 minutes despite calling multiple times did not get until next day Elevators did not work half the time. Hotel and rugs in room were filthy. Hilton shame on you!!!,Jul 25| 2021,1
The elevator was very slow to open. At times we had We called guest service several times to get some towels and toilet paper but never received it.,Jul 25| 2021,1
Did not get the room (2 dbl beds) we reserved at check in. This was resolved the next day thankfully. Rooms are not cleaned daily. Didn't know that. When we asked for extra towels| they were never delivered. We found housekeeping carts and got towels that way.Garbage piled up in the room since it was cleaned for three days.,Jul 25| 2021,2
I really really recommended for this hotel it's very convenient to go 'cause it's near metro and they have many restaurants nearby.its close to central park | time square and many famous place in NY.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,Jul 20| 2021,5
I liked the hotel very much. It was very well located from one point to central park and other to times square. We stayed for 3 nights and we didn't get the room cleaned but because of covid it is understandable. Room was just like pictured.,Jul 20| 2021,5
An easy walk to main tourist attractions but a few things to note: the elevators can take forever because there are only three for a 30-floor building. A wall placard says to "plan ahead" for an elevator wait. Also| the fridge in our room was broken and the air conditioner was on the wall right next to the bed| blasting us with air at night. No way to control flow| only temp. Not quite the quality I'm used to at a Hilton.,Jul 20| 2021,3
Let’s start with good things: hotel is very well located to people that want to enjoy Central Park| Broadway and Time square. Building is quite newly renovated and good amenities on the room. Now the bad things: The 3 Elevators are definitely not enough for the size of the building| some times  need to wait almost 5 minutes.Service is something ridiculous| they don’t clean your room until you are there for 5 days| don’t even offer you a minimum trash removal and towels replacement. Personally I don’t believe that daily service is required in a hotel| but 5 days is quite too much. The excuse is the pandemic| but hotel was completely full and rates are not cheaper than before. If the issue is labor shortage Hilton should pay better to have more people.,Jul 18| 2021,2
Unfortunately our stay was disappointing. The day we arrived the front desk personnel were more focused on their conversation about there weekend plans then checking in guests. We never received any housekeeping services. The second day we asked for fresh towels and never got them. On the third day we asked for them again and the front desk guy said what do you want me to do about it look around I don’t have them here. I have NEVER had that type of experience with any hotel. When we got into the elevator we ran into the house man and he apologized and said he was the only house man in the building. I blame management for being low staffed and for over booking a hotel that doesn’t have the man power to function.,Jul 17| 2021,1
It was no cold water in my room. I had to take shower only with hot water!,Jul 15| 2021,2
Hilton uses COVID to totally neglect cleaning the room & properly. When booking reservations| website stated room cleaning “upon request” but at check-in| we were told the cleaning is done every 3 days| on the 3rd night when requested| was told it’s done every 5 days. We stayed 6 nights and there was NO room service once! Had to ask for towels & bedding to change ourselves!! The front desk personnel was indifferent when reporting this issue. We only stayed there for their location. Not recommend!!They CANNOT use COVID as an excuse to provide reasonable services!!!!,Jul 15| 2021,3
Big bed and natural light,Jul 15| 2021,5
The worst hotel ever in my life. Don't even look at the photos as actual rooms are absolutely different. It was extremely filthy| hair all over the bed sheets| carpets with fungus| I don't even want to think about it again. I found two roaches crawling on the wall when I woke up in the middle of the night. Digusting and when I told the hotel reception about this| they took it as if it happens all the time| absolutely no apologies and rude. NEVER EVER going back here again| and do NOT recommend this hotel to anyone. With the same amount of money or just a few dolloars more| you can stay at MUCH better hotel in MUCH better condition around this area. This is a garbage.,Jul 15| 2021,1
This is a great hotel in an awesome location.,Jul 12| 2021,5
I really liked the location of this hotel| it's amenities| it's staff and the condition of the hotel and room I stayed in.  I would definitely choose this hotel again when coming to NYC.,Jul 11| 2021,5
Staff was not helpful. They say they are going to do something and don't come through.,Jul 11| 2021,2
Very good location| near by a lot of attractions,Jul 10| 2021,5
It was a bad experience,Jul 9| 2021,2
Staff was helpful and friendly! Great area| close to everything.,Jul 9| 2021,4
The room was dirty. There was spilled coffee coffee on the TV table and on the carpet. I wouldn't stay here again,Jul 9| 2021,2
Our room was not clean. There were no bags in the trash bins. Our TV remote was missing and when we finally received one| the TV did not work. There were no washcloths and barely any toilet paper and tissues left. Worst part was not having a working AC our entire trip. When we initially advised the front desk staff| he claimed he will send a tech up within 15 mins. It was over 78 degrees in the room and after waiting over an hour| we decided to wait in the lobby. It was around 12am and we did not get an answer about the status of the AC till 1:30am. It was working when we went back up to our room and stopped working in the middle of the night. We advised the front staff again| before leaving for the day| and came back to a hot room again. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone| especially for the price per night. I was very disappointed with my experience here and will not be returning.,Jul 6| 2021,1
Staff was friendly| helpful and nice!,Jul 6| 2021,5
I had one of the worst experiences in a hotel I have had in many years of traveling around the world and it was even more frustrating because it was in a "recognized" hotel chain like Hilton.Starting with the size of the rooms| we book a double double room to accommodate 4 people| I have to say that the room was so small that placing 2 double beds there was an effort and off course that is not what you see in the pictures.Next thing| when I requested to have my room cleaned I was informed that their policy "because of COVID" is to clean the room every 5 days which was not mentioned in any part during my reservation| if I would have known I would have chosen other hotel. But that may be my mistake| the work part was that even after 5 days (I stay 7 days) I requested no less than 3 times to have my room cleaned but never happen during my 7 days stay.To continue with the experience| in a room for 4 people they placed 2 towels and off course we requested another 4 towels| they brought 2 towels again and every time we needed the towels changed we needed to wait long time in the line. Similar with shampoo| toilet paper and any other thing we may need. It was like being in a cheap AB&B but paying full hotel prices.Laundry without soap available| useless business center but even all those problems would be forgivable if there were at least the intention to serve. What was more annoying was the general attitude from the hotel staff of "it is not my problem" stop bothering.,Jul 5| 2021,1
If there was an option to rate below terrible for staff friendliness and cleanliness then I would preferably select that. My 6 nights in New York has been a sore disappointment because of this hotel. The door of the room was jammed| it could only be opened with force. In case of an emergency I could never get that door to open my self. The knob of the bathroom sliding door would come out every time you would slide the door. The carpet had patches of dirt and weird smell. The bedsheets had hair on them. To top it off they would only clean your room on the fifth day of your stay regardless of how many times you request for it. Their staff will miscommunication hotel policy and say anything to get you off the phone or away from the front desk. When you try to address these issues to a supervisor| the Assistant Manager would say “sure| I’ll be” when you ask if he is the General Manager. They are extremely disrespectful and dismissive to their guest. I had to wait for 40 minutes to be given a room even though I went at the check-in time. If you want to have a good time in New York| avoid going to this hotel. It is not worth the money and stress!,Jul 5| 2021,1
We always enjoy staying at this hotel because of the location (right between Times Square and Central Park!). During this stay| our room was clean and comfortable with a nice street view. However| the customer service was a little disappointing this time around — the staff members that checked us in and out were not very friendly. Overall we had a good stay| though.,Jul 3| 2021,4
We booked two rooms and one of the rooms seemed like it was not completely cleaned!  There was food under and around the bed in our second room.  You have to call for everything since they don’t clean the rooms daily which we only found out after our 2nd night. The phones didn’t work all the time|  even the ones in the hallway.,Jun 30| 2021,3
Great location| easy walking distance to Times Square| friendly staff| felt like a safe area. Not all ice machines were always working| no washcloths available,Jun 29| 2021,4
Great location| centered but relaxed area.,Jun 28| 2021,4
The hotel isn't as clean as the pictures show. They have 3 elevators for over 40 floors and over 400 rooms. You're always waiting for the elevator. Often| their cleaning staff are taking up 2 elevators--they need a service elevator. The service is TERRIBLE. Their front desk staff are rude and willfully not helpful. I stayed 15 nights here and I had my room serviced ONCE| despite my asking every 5 days like they said I could. The ONE time they serviced it| they had lost my request for service so I had to sit outside my room to use the internet for a meeting I had to be in| but couldn't do it in the room because the cleaning staff were in there. Other than the fact that this hotel is in a good location| I would stay elsewhere.,Jun 28| 2021,2
The location is wonderful| lots of restaurants| shopping and very close to Time Square. However| for our family of 4| the rooms were small and didn’t have enough storage space for us. Rooms were not cleaned daily (just every 5 days) and it took 3 days to get an extra towel. The hotel is not terrible| but it’s not great either. We won’t stay here again.,Jun 28| 2021,3
Everyone did a great job considering NYC is just emerging from the Covid shutdown.  Rooms understaffed but very clean and quiet.  We were on the 30th floor so that helped.  We had no complaints.,Jun 28| 2021,4
Newer property with great location. However| it’s being worn badly in high traffic areas and the rooms aren’t being maintained well.,Jun 26| 2021,4
Room was very clean. Loved the bathroom. Check in was fast! They held our bags afterwards. Would definitely recommend!! 10/10! I’ll be back to stay again,Jun 26| 2021,5
We enjoyed our stay immensely and didn’t want to leave!,Jun 24| 2021,5
You get what you pay for! I know that Manhattan hotels are small.  We chose Hilton Garden inn because of the two queen bed access (family of 4). But the room was soooo small. Furthermore| when we arrived there seemed to be a problem with the air conditioning and the hot water. BOTH were shut off for hours and the hotel staff kept saying “just a few more minutes.”  It took hours to come back on| in the middle of the night after my kids and I took frigid showers.    I could have paid double for a maybe a slightly larger room| but I didn’t expect the hot water to be off!  Proximity to sites and transportation is not an issue. It’s a well located hotel to the park| shopping| subway. Overall| okay stay. Also| I think college students stay there? Not sure it was strange.,Jun 22| 2021,3
No room was made available until two hours after I checked in.,Jun 21| 2021,3
The location of this hotel is extraordinary| with easy access to theaters| transportation| and Central Park.Unfortunately| this hotel is very poorly managed. They have very few cleaning staff| who have tremendous turnover. We couldn't check in at 4:00 pm because they did not have a clean room; for our entire stay they did not have cleaning staff for daily service for our room (8 days). We had to ask the front desk for towels| soap| and trash bags. The carpets are filthy throughout the building. The washing machines| dryers| coffee machine keep breaking down. At times| there is no hot water. College students are using the hotel as a dorm| so it feels like a hostel and not like a Hilton. We witnessed job interviews of cleaning staff hiring| where the interviewee was offered a job to start right away after she stated that she did not have prior experience and did not know how to clean a hotel room. The room safes were too small to hold laptop computers and we had serious concerns for the safety of our devices with the hotel's off-the-street hiring practice and staff turnover.The hotel has very little common space for sitting| eating| or socializing. Our room had two queen beds| but only one office chair to sit. The only place to sit in the room was the beds. The bedsheets did not fit and the sheets and mattress covers kept coming off the mattresses. Nothing in this hotel is as it should be at a Hilton Garden Inn. They should take off the logo.,Jun 20| 2021,2
The rug that led into the living was soaked. The room smelled like mildew. The fridge defrosted and was leaking onto the rug.,Jun 19| 2021,1
Convenience,Jun 16| 2021,2
Was charged $60 more than the reservation cost on Expedia!,Jun 15| 2021,1
Coffee machine in room didn't work.,Jun 13| 2021,4
Location was convenient. Since Broadway was closed and due to COVID a lot of things nearby closed early and the neighborhood was quieter than expected.,Jun 12| 2021,4
I loved how close it was to food options| Times Square and transportation. It was also about a 10 min walk to the outskirts of Central Park. The room was nice with a good view and it was very clean. The staff were very friendly and even allowed us early check in because my friend had a zoom interview.,Jun 11| 2021,5
The property was nice and centrally located. The room seemed clean; however| we got bug bites.,Jun 7| 2021,3
Comfortabl£in,Jun 3| 2021,5
The hotel doesn’t offer house keeping because of COVID (understandable) However| we requested towels and they told us they ran out. They also charged me for early check in without letting me know it would be additional. The front desk clerk wouldn’t even look up at me to speak when I questioned the towel situation. Then after I get overcharged| I attempt to call them to inquire about the charges. The person told me “that’s what it is” I attempted to call corporate and got transferred several times and then call got disconnected. Everything having to do withy stay was unprofessional and unacceptable.,Jun 3| 2021,1
Some stains on the carpet but overall clean room. Nice to have a refrig and microwave.,Jun 3| 2021,4
Great time.. Beautiful room!!!,Jun 2| 2021,5
The hotel was centrally located with easy access to public transportation.  Very nice staff and rooms are a decent size for NYC.  Very happy with our stay and would recommend to anyone looking for a mid-town hotel!,Jun 2| 2021,5
Not impressed. Repeated issues with the elevators getting stuck. Toilet wasn’t working. Toilet sat was broken. Shower door handle also broken. For a Hilton| you expect better. Won’t be back.,Jun 1| 2021,3
We went to the hotel at 4:57 pm and the room was still not ready while the checkin time was 3:00pm. They did not even give any discounts and moreover it said breakfast buffet but there was no hot breakfast they only had frozen sandwiches. Would not stay here agian.,May 31| 2021,1
When I entered the building and saw it had a D energy rating I almost backed out but I registered anyway. They then informed me that they were not cleaning rooms even though Covid restrictions are lifted. The room was made up when I entered but the carpet had stains from I hope spilled coffee. Next morning they informed me that the Coffee machine was broken and the breakfast was nothing at all. They did give me a coffee pod for the room but no cream or sugar. The bed was not comfortable and the internet was crappy. Not sure I have ever stayed in a worse hotel.,May 30| 2021,2
View,May 27| 2021,4
The room was ok|  however the AC unit was super loud and couldn't get a comfort sleep.  I also asked for additional tower and it never arrived,May 25| 2021,4
I called and asked if we could check in a bit early and was told if our room was available early we would be charged for early check in. We arrived on time and had to wait 40 min for 1 of our rooms. The "Queen " beds were a little smaller than actual Queens. Besides that overall it was nice rooms| comfortable beds| good customer service and easy checkin and out!,May 24| 2021,4
The property was in excellent shape and in a good area.  Parking was $$| but that's Manhattan.  Staff was friendly and the check-in process was quick and easy. Th room was clean and I would definitely stay here again.,May 24| 2021,4
Front desk not professional at all. Young Spanish gentleman not helpful| just want to check you in as fast as possible. I frequent this hotel because it’s close to my job. I was charged for two bottles of water I didn’t drink. When it was bought to his attention he told me I need to talk to the manager or just get two bottles of water now. This check in was horrible. Had me checking in for one day and I paid for 2 days. I bought it to the manager’s attention who said it would be corrected. 2nd day I was locked out of the room. Spanish guy quickly told me to check in again the second day because it’s expedia’s fault. I will be writing a letter to Hilton Garden Inn upper management.,May 24| 2021,1
Friendly staff| great location| room could have been cleaner.,May 23| 2021,4
We got a room with a city view as requested. We stayed 2 nights...there was no houskeeping service after the first night| but we were able to get fresh towels| etc. by calling the front desk. The room service from the Empire Steakhouse was fabulous!,May 20| 2021,4
Great staff. Quiet and restful .Surprised to find there are no USB ports/ outlets  in the room for a modern day hotel. The chairs in the lobby have USB outlet|  one can use if you want to sit out there. Walking distance to great food| take out| Central Park  | Times Square,May 12| 2021,4
Excellent option for staying in NY close to every place of interest. I will give five stars if the room was bigger and spacious for two persons. If it was for me alone would be ideal and receive 5 stars,May 11| 2021,4
The room was not clean and service was bad| We had to wait 2 hours and call 3 times to get a towel.The room was as small as the bed and was not cleaned before we checked it. We hardly slept that night and left the next morning.,May 10| 2021,1
breakfast was not warm breakfast| it conisted of banana muffins and coffee. Not bad just not what I expected.,May 8| 2021,5
Two TOTAL elevators for 34 story building| with a third that was non operational. Both were shared as service elevators as well. Staff= worst service ever| after you wait 30 mins or more to ask a question. Need something?  Try waiting for 2-3 hours for a towel to be sent to your room. We stayed 5 nights and were unable to get any face towel replacements because they “didn’t have any”.  Forget about the so called breakfast. It’s a waste. Off brand frozen breakfast sandwich and cut-rate awful bite-size pastry. I wouldn’t feed the homeless with that crap. Coffee machine was always broken or out of supplies. Except for the location| this place was the worst.,May 5| 2021,1
the location is excellent| not that centric but close to everything and the metro is like 3-4 blocks away,May 4| 2021,5
The property is ok for the weekend if you need to stay in the City| is small| and the room is clean,May 3| 2021,4
The location is very good,May 1| 2021,4
Its hard for me to say what I liked about my stay. The first thing that happened was that there was a deposit and the cleck said that my credit worked for the room|  but not for the deposit. Then took cash for my deposit|  put it in another draw under the wrong name.  Luckily I caught it through my bank account that night and went and got my deposit which was under someone else's name. I never saw that cleck again.,Apr 30| 2021,1
Everything was great!!,Apr 30| 2021,5
Okay,Apr 28| 2021,3
It was a great location The size of the room was very small and the city view was nothing great| backs of buildings. You could see some of the city if you really twisted your head to see. The bed comforters had hair on them| but were kindly replaced. Towels were scarce| but after asking for more they were provided. These things should have been taken care of right from the start.,Apr 26| 2021,3
Room was New York-small and there was no daily maid service due to covid| but otherwise good. Room and bathroom furnishings were nice| besides maybe needing a room rug shampoo.,Apr 26| 2021,4
It was noisy through the wall over night| but was otherwise a fine hotel.,Apr 24| 2021,4
Like: Near several nice restaurants and bars.Dislike: Small rooms and unfriendly staff. Waiting for elevators.,Apr 24| 2021,2
X,Apr 22| 2021,4
Room floor was wet probably moldy. They didn’t offer a discount and said the hotel was fully booked therefore we couldn’t get another room. Worse place ever.,Apr 20| 2021,1
Service was no good. To many kids running thru the halls at night. Tv didnt work. Had to move rooms on the first night. Not enoug workers.. i didnt recieve my points,Apr 19| 2021,2
Awesome location! With-in walking of everything you’d want to see and more. Free umbrellas to use for when ever it’s raining. Staff was awesome. Clean rooms.,Apr 18| 2021,5
Room was very clean but the mattress was terrible. No support and made a lot of noises every time you movef,Apr 16| 2021,4
The hotel have a great location looks new or renovated rooms are comfortable beds and all inside are really good. I need to come back often and I will stay again definitely.,Apr 15| 2021,5
One elevator out of two not working| i was charged by hotel after check out and im still trying to find out why,Apr 14| 2021,2
Very average property with small rooms.  Only 2 elevators were working for over 30 floor building.  No housekeeping service was offered. I would not stay here again.,Apr 12| 2021,3
I paid extra for a room with “drinks and snacks” and got a regular room with none of that. Tv cable channels were basic. Just would not recommend it. Not worth the price I paid.,Apr 12| 2021,2
Property is so & so,Apr 12| 2021,2
The room was clean| beds were comfortable| pillows not too much. Overall the hotel was a good hotel and walking distance from all the main attractions. The only bad thing is was the elevator. Since this hotel is close to everything is a very popular hotel. The hotel only have three elevators| only two were working during my stay. The elevators take forever| and people would just end up using the stairs to go down which is not very fun when you are staying in the 30th floor like me. They really need to do something about it. That is the only reason I would not stay again at this hotel because is not very convenient.,Apr 12| 2021,3
The front desk staff were excellent and professional!,Apr 11| 2021,4
Service was very poor| the hotel is not what I expected. I have much better experiences with Hilton Gardens in other locations| but this hotel is not good as the others.,Apr 11| 2021,3
Positive:1- Room exactly as I required and want| big enough for my daughter and I|  nice view (considering we are in the middle of Manhattan and with a lot of big buildings around).2- Well located| close to stores| restaurants| metro stations| 5th avenue| central park...Negative:1- I had breakfast included| and the breakfast were tickets for the shopping store inside de hotel (snacks| chocolates and water| cokes...)| terrible.2- 3 elevators| and just 2 or one working in some occasions.3- The fridge never work.4- No cleaning services| the corridors full of trash (all guesses have their trash outside daily). I read some of the problems in the costumers before I choose this hotel and unfortunately| many of them happened to me too. Beside that I will consider be in the hotel in other occasion| hopping after the Covid'19| the services become better. I do really like my room and the location of the hotel| so lets wait to the staff/manager to read our comments and do the best to improve the service.,Apr 8| 2021,3
Staff not ready to help. There is no customer service on front desk| because Staff not prepared to listen| they just don't want to understand the problem and find a solution. Very limited to their procedures without understand how it works.,Apr 6| 2021,2
Staff definitely nees attention.Great location for moderate price.Would rather pay a little more for better conditions in the hotel. Elevator was a nightmare,Apr 5| 2021,3
The hotel needs a lot of maintanance! Furniture broken,Apr 5| 2021,2
Location is unbelievably on point with restaurants all arround.. subway transit minutes away. Minutes to Time square| top of the rock and central park. Loved it.,Apr 4| 2021,5
The biggest complaint that I have was that the heating/ventilation system was not working correctly in my room.(2801) The thermostat was not working correctly and the vents near the bathroom were constantly blowing in cool air. I was cold most of the time. Very cold at night even with the thermostat set at 76. Other than this problem| it was a very nice| clean and quiet hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful. Great location near theater district and Central Park. I am sure that the quality of this hotel has been impacted by the covid  epidemic like other hotels and I would expect that one would have a better experience during more normal times.,Apr 4| 2021,3
The location of the hotel was really good. It is close to everywhere so I recommend this hotel if you have limited time and wanna be close to everywhere. But it wasn't that clean and there was an elevator problem. There were 3 elevators and sometimes only one of them was working. Sometimes we waited more than 15 mins to get outside of the hotel.,Apr 3| 2021,3
great location! great view!  nice size room,Apr 2| 2021,5
The property was very clean and up to expectations especially during these times. A pool is probably the only thing this place is missing nice atmosphere and relatively nice staff.,Apr 2| 2021,5
Only two of three elevators was working and were limited to four people but in this circumstance or I should wait 20 minites to take one or take it crowded. The room apparented clean but I found hair in the bed a hairbrush and a skirt on the floor .  Only one tiny soap for 5 days. And| the room had a strong musty smell. There was not breakfast because the pandemic but the selections of items tht they offered was very limited. It wasn't what I expected.,Mar 31| 2021,2
Good location| easy walk to Central Park. Extremely small rooms size. The Hallways reeked of marijuana. Front desk staff was impatient and condescending. Would not recommend.,Mar 31| 2021,2
No complaints| all good.. wish it had parking available with the stay,Mar 31| 2021,4
Great location. One of the 3 elevators was out of service the entire week I was there| made for long wait times. I had a room with an adjoining door (didn't request it| just happened) and 2 of the neighbors I ended up with during my stay smoked in their room and it permeated into mine. Would recommend requesting a room without an adjoining door if that bothers you.Housekeeping service| even when requested| is hit or miss and only allowed after the 5th day of your stay. I requested it twice and never got it. Finally had to ask for toilet paper and towels. Overall| just ok.,Mar 30| 2021,3
The staff was very friendly| especially Robert| he was very helpful. Due to pandemic| the breakfast is basically just,Mar 30| 2021,4
the hotel overcharge the parking fee|  the hotel charged for the $50.00 per day| but the parking place only charge for $40.00 per day.  The overcharge the customer and did not refund the difference to us.,Mar 30| 2021,2
There were only 2 elevators so whenever you wanted to go outside or come back in there was always a line for the elevators. Expect to wait 15 min to get back to you’re room.,Mar 29| 2021,4
Great location! Room very clean and pretty spacious for 2 people. Bed was good (pillows were flat). Subway stations all around! The only downfall during this visit were the elevators| only 2/3 were running for the entire building so many times we had to wait to go up/down| but no more than 5-10 minutes. Besides that we had a marvelous stay!!,Mar 29| 2021,4
Waiting 20 minutes for an elevator to be freed was a bit of a hassle| check in was okay although there should’ve been another person helping out because of the long line.,Mar 29| 2021,4
The only complaint is that the refrigerator wasn’t working. However we were giving a new one that worked... everything was great,Mar 29| 2021,5
I stayed 2 nights| arrived Friday evening and left sunday morning. No one showed up to clean the room on Saturday| even to collect the trash| nothing. Sunday by 9am the housekeeper knocked the door. Really?! Very desorganized!,Mar 29| 2021,4
Hotel had a convenient location but the room and bathroom very small.  Minimal counter space in bathroom for toiletries.,Mar 25| 2021,3
Called front dest because the mini fridge wasn't working. Was told that it wasn't a fridge| its a "cooler" and I can go down to the restaurant to get ice to put it in and that should keep the "cooler" at a low temp. The room was supposed to have a mini fridge. It was clearly a fridge that was broken. Instead of dealing with the problem| they threw this ridiculous lie at me. Was too tired to deal. Make sure your MINI FRIDGE works!,Mar 21| 2021,4
There was only ONE PERSON doing the check in at 3pm. Very disappointing.,Mar 21| 2021,2
Hi| everyone was so accommodating I was staying overnight for a hospital stay and the night before anything I asked for was brought to my room. Peter the young man who brought me more towels and so on was a wonder.  He made sure I had everything I needed and took good care and the staff on the front desk were wonderful.,Mar 17| 2021,5
Overall clean staff was stupendously greetful and a nice property to enjoy in nyc,Mar 16| 2021,5
No cleaning service| they didn’t even pick up the trash. The corridor was littered for most of our stay.,Mar 13| 2021,4
Staff was very nice| but i paid for a city view room and our view was the back of a bunch of buildings. That was the only disappointing part of our stay.,Mar 8| 2021,4
The adjoining rooms were good but the shower in room 2201 had a bad noise,Mar 8| 2021,5
Hilton is promoting its "Hilton Clean Stay" rhetoric in a seemingly joint effort to fight against covid-19| so we expected the room to be cleaned properly and 'sealed'. It was 'sealed' when we arrived| but the room was not properly cleaned (at all). There was hair and dust all over| on the beds| the floor| the desk| the phone. We asked for the room to be cleaned| and front desk denied us that| and it took us about 1.5hrs to simply get fresh sheets that we had to change ourselves. It took a while for management to even begin to address our issues (two days later). Not sure if we just got unlucky| but it was totally unacceptable.,Mar 6| 2021,2
The staff was great and very accommodating. When I got to the room| my fridge didn’t work at all. But they replaced the fridge after the first day after I had notified them. The shower nozzle was also malfunctioning and I did not have hot water throughout my stay which was frustrating / disappointing.,Mar 5| 2021,3
Problems with ventilation and smoking in the hotel.  Made it unpleasant to be in the room. Room was very nice and clean and location is excellent.,Mar 1| 2021,3
It was nothing less than great place to stay!!! I enjoyed my night and so did my kids and husband. We will book again,Feb 26| 2021,5
Great hotel loved everything about the staff and room beautiful,Feb 20| 2021,5
Great location for metro access and walking around.  Cleaning service was not the best.  Bed was half made because sheet didn't fit.  Replaced bath towel with only one when they knew it was more than one person in the room.  Didn't empty trash can and the door to the bath room won't close.,Feb 17| 2021,3
Realmente tiene excelente localización| el cuarto moderno| limpio y cómodo. Un lugar muy tranquilo y acogedor. Altas medidas de prevención de COVID 19. Altamente recomendado.,Feb 16| 2021,5
Great stay for the price. Comfortable| clean and close to everything.,Feb 16| 2021,4
Not to bad| just the elevator was out which made a difficult stay,Feb 16| 2021,3
My stay was for one day with my boyfriend and the hotel aesthetic was so clean| simple| and nice. I really loved the bathroom| and the bed was comfortable. The wifi sucks though.,Feb 15| 2021,4
Area is very nice and close to subway hotel is good,Feb 14| 2021,5
Bed was old and sunken in| bedding was thin and uncomfortable| pillows were old and used| and room was FREEZING! I set temperature to 70 and I didn’t rise above 67 all night on the thermometer.,Feb 8| 2021,2
Close to my work location. Very convenient when I’m working long hours,Feb 7| 2021,4
Hotel was extremely  comfortable. I originally stayed two nights due to weather because of the work. I ended up staying an extra night.Only thing is my fridge wasn’t working.,Feb 4| 2021,5
Nice room| comfortable bed| great shower. Enjoyed the flat screen TV and coffeemaker. There was a problem with the heat in the room and a technician came up right away to fix it. Room service menus were good and so was the food. Could have had a couple more House Blend coffee pods. Overall great stay.,Feb 4| 2021,4
very good price and fair to quality. Recommend for solo travelers.,Jan 22| 2021,4
This hotel is very comfortable| clean and in a great location. Service was excellent.I enjoyed my stay a lot. Too bad the restaurant and bar could not be open (due to Covid.),Jan 21| 2021,4
I stayed at this hotel for a week. There was no housekeeping service or trash removal. There was barely any heat or hot water in the room. Only one of three elevators was functioning. The front desk staff were not helpful.,Jan 15| 2021,2
Stay was ok. Room was a little tight I was expecting more space but it wasn’t a deal breaker. Elevators are slow| but they have signs posted letting you know peak times which are during the week. However on a Saturday and with less people traveling it was still busy. Check in was easy and quick.,Jan 11| 2021,4
Due to Covid elevators allowed only 2 per elevator or per group. Lines were long elevators took forever. Other than that our stay was great!,Jan 6| 2021,4
Great location!,Jan 4| 2021,5
What can I say| I have an ESA a and I needed to move out a side table to make it a step stool for him and I found dried vomit on the walls behind the bedside table.  There was a small insect in the bathroom when I arrived.  One of the towels was dirty (stained) and one was clean upon arrival.  There were 2 silica packets under the bed| some food on the floor| and a water bottle cap - all of which could have killed me dog had I not checked first.  Hair in the bathroom. Hair in the drain - when I showered I was standing in 2” of water and other guests hair came up.  Getting my car out of the garage took 20 minutes for them to find it.  I stayed there once in the past| the manager is extremely unhelpful but the location of this hotel cannot be beat.  I mean the most perfect location for NYC and very reasonable prices.  It’s just funny bc the cleanliness was SO horrid and they have signs everywhere saying “we are committed to a safe and clean stay” LOL through a worldwide pandemic and still utterly filthy.  I have filed complaints with Hilton.  I know this all sounds hard to believe because how could a HILTON (a generally reputable hotel chain) be so gross?!  I felt the same| so please refer to every single photo I took during my stay lol.  Still waiting to hear back from the manager regarding my complaints.,Jan 3| 2021,1
Due to the pandemic| the amenities weren't available but the staff is awesome| rooms are very spacious and the location of the hotel is perfect.,Jan 2| 2021,4
You get what you paid for. That's all I'm going to say.,Dec 31| 2020,2
La atención del lugar es pésima por parte de los empleados. El desayuno que ofrecen es una cafetera q estuvo ROTA 2 días y nosotros fuimos por 4 días. El depósito es de 200 dólares y nos devolvieron 184 cuando no hicimos ningún gasto y hasta la habitación arreglada dejamos. No es recomendable para nada! Lo único interesante es un gimnasio q está frente al hotel.,Dec 28| 2020,1
Great location. Friendly staff. Most hotels (Hiltons) will allow you to check in early if the room is ready WITHOUT an early checkin fee. We couldn’t checkin until EXACTLY 3pm at this Hilton. Trash bags were left in the hallway when we checked in| until the next day when we were leaving.,Dec 22| 2020,4
Because of covid| they didnt even make the beds while we were there. Room was so small you had to sit on the bed while you ate.,Dec 8| 2020,3
This property was very clean and the staff was extremely friendly.,Dec 1| 2020,5
Selected the property for convenient location and price point.,Nov 22| 2020,4
Overall stay was not bad| however| not what we were expecting for a hilton in Manhattan.,Nov 16| 2020,3
The staff was amazing. They made sure that we had everything that we needed. They were professional| polite and helpful.,Nov 3| 2020,5
The staff was nice and friendly.  The room and the rest of the hotel was clean and in a great area for food and walking.  It would have been wonderful if they would have has free breakfast :) but I would stay here again if I every went back.,Nov 2| 2020,5
Old noise bed| loud heating| very tiny room. Little disappointed being a Hilton Hotel| management need to work on update beds| carpets and  dated Heating units.,Nov 2| 2020,2
We arrived late evening and the front desk gentleman was GREAT!! Very helpful and accommodating. After being in the room one night it was VERY small room for 2 queen beds - we had 3 people and it was not very comfortable for space.  Was not expecting a ton but it was pretty tight.  Sent a message on the app and never had a reply; finally went and asked about a possible 2nd room or the attached room to ours on our floor - and was told nothing was available even though the “safety sticker” on the door that adjoined ours was never broken open| showing that someone was in that room.  The daytime folks were not as pleasant as the first gentleman we were greeted by on our first night.  I should have checked further into the space in our room and about accompanying rooms but there was no helpful possible solutions from the daytime asssitance at the front desk.  Overall - an “OK” stay - thanks,Oct 26| 2020,3
The Keurig did not work and the cold water in the sink did not either.   Overall lovely hotel.  We did not say anything about it as we did not want anyone in the room during our stay.  When we checked in they explained that during the current pandemic there would not be usual room cleaning and if we needed something specific to let them know.  We were fine with that.,Oct 20| 2020,4
I booked a room with a terrace but when I got there they told me that the rooms with the terrace were limited and only on the 2nd floors The room that they gave me was on the 24th floor which I didn’t request. I think the room info on Orbitz was wrong because I booked a smoking room with a terrace and a city view. The desk agent told me this was a non smoking property so I was confused. Overall my stay was okay it was in a great location near pretty much everything you would need for a Manhattan stay. I would stay here again.,Oct 18| 2020,4
Due to Covid-19 I don’t think they could clean the rooms or hallways but they did take out your trash. And give fresh towels if requested. Rooms are not too big but definitely manageable if two people don’t have to work from the same space.,Oct 6| 2020,4
Excellent service. Front desk Marcus did a great job locating and helping me retrieve some clothing. Bartender| very good job as wellWill come again,Oct 5| 2020,5
Stay was great customer service.,Oct 5| 2020,5
I have stayed in many Hotels in the past and The Hilton Garden Inn NY Central Park| by far has been the best in service and attitude. The host were fantastic and overall the place just had a type of tranquility about it that made it very lovable. I'm sure to go back when such stays are needed. Thank you H.G.I.N.Y.,Oct 1| 2020,5
Great place to stay in Manhattan. Conveniently located between Central Park and Time Square!,Sep 28| 2020,5
Great location| central to Time Square| Central Park and the subway.  Great restaurant located within the hotel as well| amazing food!,Sep 28| 2020,5
Clean room| cozy bed| great price. Had an issue with the toilet in the room but the manager switched our room promptly and fixed it. Not our favorite ny neighborhood/location but was close to our friends and the park so worked well for this particular trip!,Sep 28| 2020,4
Empty hotel ! No wait for elevators ! Clean rooms and coffee cups. Extra towels. Free food.,Sep 27| 2020,5
My actual stay was ok. I went solo or my birthday. I celebrated myself with balloons and confetti in my room. The front desk person saw me come in with lots of balloons. No one ever said to me| I will be charged an extra $86 if I didn’t clean those balloons out when I go. I found out the next day when my card was charged 👎 If I had known I would’ve removed them.,Sep 27| 2020,3
Friendly staff & great location! No hassle!,Sep 26| 2020,5
Absolutely Fantastic. The stay was great. Excellent Customer service. Felt very welcomed. The room was very clean. The view was spectacular. Overall i give it a 10. Would definitely come back for another stay. Thanks!,Sep 23| 2020,5
Front desk was very helpful and polite,Sep 20| 2020,5
Had an awesome night. No complaints.,Sep 20| 2020,5
Service was great. Everyone at the front desk were very helpful and polite.,Sep 18| 2020,5
Hilton is Hilton!!!,Sep 14| 2020,5
Very clean and spacious for the price| loved that it had microwave| a mini fridge and a coffee maker there too. To my surprise not many hotels have that for the price. Overall really liked my experience and I will definitely be coming back. The staff is extremely friendly too!,Sep 13| 2020,5
Everything was fine except there was no hot water in the shower. Staff was friendly and room was clean.,Sep 12| 2020,4
It’s located right around the theater district and the staff is really nice,Sep 10| 2020,4
The hotel was clean and comfortable. The staff was very helpful. It's a great location for Midtown Manhattan.As with other reviews I have read the parking was very expensive. There are garages all over that part of town I certainly would encourage anyone to search out their own parking | however it was convenient to have the valet deal with my vehicle for the weekend! Sometimes you need to treat yourself.,Mar 20| 2020,4
The elevators were very slow. They do have information saying that would be the case but there were times when they were out of service and we had to walk 6 floors down.,Mar 11| 2020,4
We loved this location! We were able to walk nearly everywhere we wanted to visit| averaging 10 miles per day! The hotel was very clean and well-appointed with very friendly and accommodating staff. Our only negative was the inability to turn the heat off in our room to allow cool air to flow. We had maintenance come in and it helped some; however| still a little too warm for us. The elevators were quick and frequent| too!,Mar 11| 2020,5
location as well as distance from times square.   just a great location,Mar 6| 2020,5
The hotel is located right where we needed it to be. The staff was friendly and helpful. Like all NYC hotels| this one had small rooms. I was a little disappointed in the bed - the mattress was a bit overly firm.,Mar 1| 2020,3
The hotel is fine. The rooms are small but clean and the location was decent. But the scent of the cleaning products was so strong in the room it gave me a headache. Housekeeping did not stop using the products even though we asked 3 times.,Feb 27| 2020,3
Great,Feb 27| 2020,5
Location great| bed comfortable| hotel staff very friendly,Feb 24| 2020,5
The hotel room needed to be updated. Many of the lights did not work properly| the safe was broken and the shower also did not work properly. The bed needed a better duvet cover.,Feb 19| 2020,3
Great location| clean and pretty room.  I had a king bed| large room given it's NYC| 28th floor.  Elevator is slow and the line is long.  Front desk could use another person at check-in.  Coffee downstairs in the morning.  Empire Steakhouse is in house and offers room service with a 20% markuo and $6.50 and delivery fee.  I think that's ridiculous.  I did eat there - unimpressed.,Feb 19| 2020,5
Everything was awesome - only negative was wait time for elevators so we frequently walked the stairs up to the 15th floor.,Feb 18| 2020,5
Convinient lacation | just few minutes from Time Square  | 5th Ave. | Central Park...,Feb 18| 2020,5
Foremost| the staff is exceptionally nice and accomodating. The double bed hotel room itself is very clean and comfy yet a bit cramped. As most everyone will attest| the elevators are not sufficient for amount of rooms and service staff also must use them to get around so patience needed. Bottom line...really good midtown location. Accessible to so many nyc attractions. We were in town to be out and about enjoying and not spending much time in hotel so could overlook tight space...Reminds me of small nyc apartment I lived in for many years as a young new yorker years ago. Honestly| I do recommend this hotel for a few days stay but if longer look for more spacious accomodations.,Feb 18| 2020,4
The location is perfect| central but not too close to Time Square.  Lots of great bars and restaurants in the Hells Kitchen area.Lovely touch to have coffee| tea and cookies in reception.Although the cookies had all gone one day. And the coffee in the morning| no milk or stirrers.The staff were very helpful from booking our taxi to the airport| helping with queries or just general hello in the morning.I had booked a room with a street view...it wasn't really.  More of a small street view with a view of many buildings| but it was fine.  The room was a great size| lovely bathroom and huge shower.The only thing which wasn't good in the hotel..the lifts. A nightmare. With 34 floors. Stopping at many| it took so long to go up and down.  If this can be sorted| then it would be perfect all round.,Feb 17| 2020,4
Great location to explore nyc| steps from Time square. The rooms are new and exceptionally clean. Staff is very welcoming and helpful at all times. We checked in late and exhausted after long delays at the airport. We accidentally forgot a gift bag in the lobby; the staff found us and safely delivered the bag. Losing the Lego in it would have been a huge disappointment for my 4-year old nephew. Thank  you!,Feb 17| 2020,5
It took 3 different rooms to settle down lolOrdered King bed with breakfast| got double bed without breakfast coupons then she gave us double queen beds room without TV. While inside the room| their engineers walked in without asking/ knocking the door. Scary!!,Feb 15| 2020,1
Fantastic staff and a great location!  Elevators are always full| but they have cookies in the lobby| so waiting for the next elevator isn't all that bad!,Feb 14| 2020,5
Great location. Rooms are attractive and well maintained. Cleaning help very responsive.,Feb 13| 2020,5
After my flight from LGA was cancelled| I was rebooked on a flight from Newark the following day. This hotel| with it's free shuttle| restaurant and bar| was perfect. I must say| the room was huge| very comfortable and the chicken fingers at the restaurant were exactly what I was craving. I'd stay here again any day.,Feb 12| 2020,5
The best thing about the hotel is location. Perfect for the various subway lines and access to many NY favorites.  Now what is disappointing is the elevators| be prepared to wait a good 5-15min no matter the time of day.  And that is going up to your room or trying to return to the lobby.  Also| the rooms are small.  Large luggage and more than two people you will feel cramped.  No space at all. I personally would not choose this location again and only hope other Hiltons are better.,Feb 10| 2020,2
I paid for a king room and was given two bed. I shouldve been told about this by either the hotel or expedia,Feb 9| 2020,1
Excellent in every way!!,Feb 5| 2020,5
Good location| clean rooms... small elevators made it difficult with large crowds getting to the room,Feb 2| 2020,4
The staff at Hilton Garden Inn were lovely. Someone greeted me whenever I came in and out| and the room was spacious for Manhattan. This is a great hotel in the middle of everything but far enough away from Times Square to be quiet (at least on the 23rd floor). I couldn't have asked for a better experience.,Jan 31| 2020,5
I had to pay a 'deposit' alongside paying for my stay at check in. At checkout I was reassured that the deposit would be refunded right after. Instead of getting the refund back Hilton deducted the entire amount of the stay another time. So I payed the whole amount twice| and no one at Hilton seems to bother to even answer my message| let alone refund me..,Jan 30| 2020,1
There are only three elevators and at certain times you can be waiting over 20 minutes for the elevator to arrive.  We took the stairs down from the 15th floor after waiting over 20 minutes (with our suitcases).,Jan 28| 2020,4
The room was good| staff was fantastic| but in true NY fashion there were literally bags of trash in the hallway the whole time we were there. I’m not sure if it’s a space issue or what. But| it kind of brought down the value of the whole place. When we left the room it was a little like living in an apartment where your neighbor doesn’t want the trash in their house| but is too lazy to take it down so they just leave it on the back stairway.,Jan 26| 2020,4
Room size was good and staff were very friendly. Amenities and everything were great too. Hotel was also relatively quiet| which I wasn’t expecting - my room was right next to the elevator and I slept like a baby.,Jan 22| 2020,5
Clean room| good shower| nice coffee bar in the morning in the lobby.  Nice staff and great location to everything.  Would definitely stay there again!,Jan 21| 2020,5
Excellent location. Rooms are clean and just enough space for NYC. The only down was the elevators and I was able to hear everything in the room besides mine. I was out most of the time so that was not a big issue.,Jan 21| 2020,4
Amazing location. The room is very clean and fairly spacious for NYC. We had two queen beds which was key. We were very close to Central Park| Broadway| Times Square| you name it. I’m a Hilton honors member| but because I booked through Expedia we weren’t allowed free bottle of water. But turned out to be not such a big thing as they had the most delicious raspberry water available in the lobby every day. I would absolutely stay here again.,Jan 17| 2020,5
Perfect and central location to the events we were scheduled to attend.  On the last day/night we heard this annoying buzzing sound like a cell phone which wouldn't stop.  Had we stayed an additional night we would have notified the front desk.  The staff was very pleasant and helpful.  Will definitely be returning during future visits to New York.,Jan 17| 2020,4
Amazing if ever in New York best place to stay at !,Jan 15| 2020,5
There was no basic items such as tooth brush and tooth paste. Furthermore| there was no blanket!!!! Is it possible?I don’t know that this hotel is worth as the price.,Jan 14| 2020,1
Friendly clean nice price,Jan 14| 2020,5
The Hilton has always been a wonderful hotel experience for me while in New York.  I appreciate the warmth and hospitality shown by every member of the Hilton staff.  Housekeeping is particularly excellent| and I want thank them for being so easy to work with!,Jan 13| 2020,5
Quick checkin and friendly staff. Housekeeping staff was also quite efficient. However| the elevators are quite slow even though there are three of them. During peak hours| the hotel does warn to allow extra wait time| it can take up to 15 mins or more though to get to use the elevator either directions. Luckily| we were on a lower floor and so we just used the stairs. We suggest that if you can| at checkin| ask for a lower floor (4 and below)| this way| you have a choice to use the stairs if and when you can.,Jan 13| 2020,4
Not worth the money. Absolutely wastage of money. Will never go there again,Jan 13| 2020,1
Easy to walk to Time Square| Central Park and Theatres.,Jan 12| 2020,5
This was not the Hilton we expected.  We reserved a king size bed but got 2 doubles.  Beds were too soft and duvet cover made from polyester type material.  Walls very thin and late night noise disturbance from adjoining room.,Jan 12| 2020,2
Lo staff che lavora alla Conciergie di un hotel sito a Manhattan vicino a Central Park| si trova ad affrontare continuamente problemi diversi con clienti frettolosi e ansiosi. Un lavoro difficile.Lo staff dell'Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park fa questo lavoro molto bene e con grande professionalità e pazienza| coordinato dalla brevissima Signora Tess.Grazie ancora per il supporto che ci avete dato| e per l'ospitalità. Torneremo ancora.,Jan 11| 2020,5
Everything was great except the heating system because of the cold room that never warmed up all night.,Jan 11| 2020,4
The room was small but comfortable.  Mid-town location was excellent!  Coffee in the lobby was hot and delicious.  Our only complaint was that the elevators were not able to handle the volume of patrons| resulting in long waits.,Jan 9| 2020,4
The rooms are pretty compact and not suited for more than 3 sharing as closet storage is minimal. The room wasn’t cleaned unless I rang to ask for the 5-day stay. Staff are helpful and I loved the warm daily cookies.,Jan 9| 2020,3
The hotel is in a great location near Central Park| Times Square & Rockefeller Center.  We walked everywhere.  We ended up with a two queen room that was big enough for us| I wish it had an area wide enough for a small twin blow up mattress but it did not.  The room was clean & nice. Parking is pricey at most hotels| this one had $70 or $75 valet parking.  We ended up reserving parking at a nearby garage via the web.  That worked out well| just $35 but we had to walk to and from it.,Jan 8| 2020,5
Overall very pleased with the hotel| everything in great condition| brilliant location| very comfy bed and all mod cons| was especially handy having a fridge and microwave in the room| the shower was always piping hot and the room was cleaned daily with toiletries replenished daily| our room was behind an elevator shaft and was suprisingly peaceful. Only small criticism was it was not clear what things in the room were free to use (aside from the bottles of water that were labelled as 3 dollars each if used) the coffee machine had no instructions on how to use either or if the sachets of tea and coffee were chargeable. Reception had flavoured water and cookies on offer for free in the afternoons but limited supply| but in the mornings were weren't sure if the tea and coffee items left out were free either| better signage and info needed really. Also the towels were not very large for using in the shower. Staff friendly and useful bag check area for when we arrived before check-in and left the bags with them on our last day.,Jan 7| 2020,4
The hotel is a little worn but in a great location| and the staff was very accommodating. The restaurant that adjoins the hotel and serves the complimentary breakfast is not owned by Hilton and is not the same quality. The breakfast ‘manager’ was quite rude and there were limited health food choices.,Jan 6| 2020,4
Very clean| great location| front desk staff friendly and quick,Jan 5| 2020,4
Very nice. Polite| friendly| helpful staff. Clean accommodations.,Jan 5| 2020,5
Great location| friendly staff| and clean room. Would definitely stay there again.,Jan 4| 2020,4
We stayed during Christmas time on the 8th floor. The room was nice and clean with excellent daily housekeeping.The room was little bit small| but just to sleep there it was perfect.Time square| Central Park| museums| nice restaurants are within walking distance from the hotel. Thank you for the hotel’s friendly staff!,Jan 4| 2020,5
Over priced and poor service. You have to ask for everything several times and they make no effort to accommodate you. Also what the other reviews are saying about the elevators is true. In 4 days only once did an elevator stop at our floor when we called it to go down. All other times after waiting several minutes we had to take the stairs to go down to the lobby. We could hear the elevators going up and down but they never stopped at our floor.,Jan 4| 2020,2
Great location / amazing staff.  We really enjoyed our stay.,Jan 3| 2020,5
Great location to walk to most sight seeing spots.,Jan 3| 2020,5
All staff I encountered during my stay were very friendly and helpful.,Jan 3| 2020,4
This was my very first time staying at the Hilton Garden Inn/Central Park. I normally stay at the Millennium Hilton in the business district but they were booked. Although the room was nice| the mini refrigerator did not function properly and was not up to code as far as the proper  temperature for a refrigerator| our sink was constantly leaking around the faucet area and my room was very close to the maintenance closet so I would hear constant shutting of the door but at a reasonable time of the morning hours. Also the Elevators were very slow. The best things about this Hilton are having access to a variety of restaurants| your within walking distance to Time Square| Columbus Circle which has an indoor mall and Whole Foods and of course your not too far from Central Park. I still would give it a go and stay again!,Dec 31| 2019,4
My room was cold.  I had the heat turned up to 78| yet it was still chilly in my room.  Also it takes forever to get an elevator.  I would think twice about staying here again.,Dec 30| 2019,3
Room wasn’t ready!!Coffee maker was broke| shower cover was off and safe wouldn’t work!They did give us some free breakfast for the inconvenience! But it was run down a little and Libby very crowded!,Dec 30| 2019,1
Downgrade without any compensation nor information Room not ready at 5pm. Average waiting time for a lift above 20 Minutes. Staff rude and not professional. The worst experience of the decade!,Dec 28| 2019,1
Rhis is an exceptionsl.place for friends and family,Dec 28| 2019,4
Love the location.Slow elevator availability during peak times are inconvenient.,Dec 27| 2019,4
Clean property and location is excellent . Walking distance to time square . Staff are helpful and friendly . Definitely would stay again .,Dec 26| 2019,4
They took my credit card for incidentals and told me they were going to put a $50 hold. Checking my statements I realized that not only they charged me the $50 and not make it a hold but they also charged me $70 twice for parking and I did not even have a car. The front desk person that helped me with the checkin was new and in training so the mistake was made there. I called the hotel 3 times already for them to fix this and still no resolution. The latest was yesterday that I should wait 3 days for a refund. Terrible customer service and what they did is fraud,Dec 21| 2019,1
The only complaint that I would have about this hotel is the elevators. There are like 20 odd floors with three elevators and when it gets busy| you will wait for the elavators.,Dec 17| 2019,4
This hotel was in a great location. Very| very small for the rate we paid. The staff was friendly😊,Dec 10| 2019,4
The location was great| but it was a little pricey.,Dec 9| 2019,4
room very comfortable| spotless bathroom (shower only)| nice staff. surprise complimentary snacks in lobby one afternoon. Complimentary tea/coffee in mornings in lobby. Elevators are a problem. On 2 occasions had to walk down 9 floors as elevator never came.  Getting a bit older to go down so many flights. Location is very good.,Dec 1| 2019,4
There was a huge wait at check in around 3 pm.  The desk staff was nice...but| the scent in the lobby was so strong...at first I thought it was a guest...but| it is everywhere in the hotel...public spaces...not in our room. A fake plug-in type smell .  really horrible.elevators were so slow...more than a 15 minute wait and not at the peak times noted by the elevators...had to take the stairs several times,Nov 25| 2019,2
The location was great to get to everything! We stayed on the 33 floor and the elevator was a absolute nightmare!,Nov 25| 2019,3
The fridge had to be pulled out completely to turn it on (it was off and heavy)| the tv had a horrible lower dim to it so we couldn’t watch anything| water pressure was bad and took 10 minutes with water running to finally heat up| heater was set to 80 to feel any sort of heat and it was still cold in room (wasn’t even that cold outside)| elevators were small and kept going out of service in a hotel that has nearly 40 floors. Overall bad experience for my girlfriends 21st birthday celebration. A refund should be issued for this kind of experience. Wouldn’t give this a hotel another chance otherwise,Nov 24| 2019,1
Not happy that they charged us for bottled water which was offerred to us for free. When we checked out I asked the desk if we owe them anything. They said no and my deposit will be credited back to my account in full. I only found out when I checked my bank statement and saw the charge.,Nov 23| 2019,3
I was grossly disappointed about your hotel. Before my arrival| my confirmed reservation was cancelled. I spent another 3hrs to get another hotel as i came from another country. I woke up to meet my account debited for room that was not provided. I complained| till now my money has not been refunded. I felt scammed.,Nov 20| 2019,2
Smells awful. Someone in my floor was smoking. Service sucks.,Nov 19| 2019,1
Great staff and very accommodating. The rooms were tiny but clean. Watch out for the elevators| they are slow to arrive.,Nov 17| 2019,3
Everything was great other than the elevators! They took forever!!,Nov 17| 2019,4
The staff was exceptional!  Everyone was very helpful.,Nov 15| 2019,5
Great property| service| and location.  The only negative is the lack of closet space.,Nov 15| 2019,5
The room was comfortable. The location excellent. But| most remarkable| was the friendliness and efficiency of the staff. Everyone we encountered from check in to check out was superb. We’ll be back!,Nov 11| 2019,5

Friendly and helpful staff. Clean and room was a good size for New York hotels. Great location...close to subway| Times Square| Columbus Circle| Central Park.,Oct 21| 2019,5
Great location| friendly staff.  An engineering issue made the room we booked unavailable| hotel notified Expedia who DID NOT notify me.  Not happy about that| but happy with the hotel and accommodations.,Oct 19| 2019,5
The hotel location is excellent and the staff very professional| helpful and friendly. Two major flaws though| the extremely slow elevators and the bathroom water temperature that seems impossible to adjust.,Oct 15| 2019,4
Excellent location coffee in the morning clean modern room,Oct 13| 2019,5
Great service. Rooms are tiny but that’s to be expected since it is NYC.,Oct 11| 2019,5
We had a king sized room. The rooms are very small. Just enough for 2 people and 2 bags essentially. The bed was comfortable. Overall| despite the small size the room was comfortable. I wouldn’t say housekeeping was amazing| we left tips daily and some days we didn’t even get new towels. Otherwise| the front desk staff were very friendly. One other thing is that the elevators are very busy. Sometimes it would be a 5 minute wait to get an elevator. Overall though| I would stay there again.,Oct 3| 2019,4
Great staff| very friendly and helpful.  Super location and walking distance to major attractions. Felt safe in and outside hotel.  Room felt cramped between desk and bed so we didn’t have a spacious room| but it was adequate.  Comfortable bed and great to have AC.,Oct 1| 2019,4
Excellent location| walk to Central Park| Times| Square| Columbus Circle| etc.  Had a room with outdoor terrace| not hotel's fault but extremely noisy with roof-top air conditioners directly beside.  Only hotel complaint was the mattress was uncomfortable| however that is always subjective.,Sep 28| 2019,4
This is a excellent location. Walking distance to the time square. Great location and clean. I would stay again.,Sep 22| 2019,4
The wait for the elevators was unacceptable. Period! Very inconvenient.,Sep 21| 2019,4
For the life of me I can't understand why this hotel gets so many positive ratings.  My reservation was screwed up| even though I had paid in advance.  The rooms are tiny| and it is nearly impossible to work with a laptop at the narrow desk.  The bathroom was only so-so clean| and there was abundant hair on the floor.  Th elevators are grossly inadequate for the number of rooms| and there is frequently a 5-10 minute wait -- or longer -- for the elevator to arrive.  The location is fine if you have to be in the northern Times Square neighborhood| but there are so many other choices in the area.,Sep 21| 2019,1
We loved this hotel!! The room was comfortable and clean. The location is perfect- close to everything| yet not too noisy. And above all| the service was impeccable! Very professional and always with a smile.,Sep 21| 2019,5
The location could not be better. Free coffee every morning in the lobby. Flavoured water free in the lobby everyday all day. Close to a multitude of restaurants and subway stations. The staff were very friendly.,Sep 20| 2019,5
Location was great as close to all things that we wanted to see,Sep 20| 2019,5
About what I would expect from a 3 star hotel. I had limited need but in general the staff was nice and friendly. Hotel was a little run down in general but clean and in a good location. I was| however| disappointed with their concierge service| specifically with my transportation to the airport. It was more money than Uber or Lyft but decided to use it as I expected a decent car| as opposed to not knowing with the other services. I was wrong.  The car was clean but small and not better than the other services. The person barely spoke English but managed to tell me 3 times| including showing me on the payments slip| that the tip was not included on the overpriced ride. Won’t use their service ever again. Not a great last impression. Overall the hotel was okay. Not great but not bad either.,Sep 11| 2019,4
The location is great| the rooms are clean but the hallways need a refresh they are very old and need new flooring. Preferably not carpet!,Sep 2| 2019,4
For New York the hotel was ok| rooms not too small| more or less clean. Not a fan of the area though which is dirty smelly and too loud. But I guess that’s midtown.,Sep 1| 2019,3
Extremely busy and staff was not very attentive and not friendly. The room was small but cozy enough for two. It was very clean,Aug 31| 2019,3
Really nice stay,Aug 31| 2019,5
Desk staff very helpful.....elevators TERRIBLY SLOW!!!!!   Good location for everything we did each day,Aug 29| 2019,4
Great location in center. We walked everywhere from/to this hotel. Nice warm drink at lobby in the morning.,Aug 29| 2019,5
It was nice to have a decent amount of space in the room. We've stayed some places in NYC where we could hardly walk around the bed! This was a very comfortable room. The only down side| and really it wasn't that bad| they only had 3 elevators for 34 floors. There were some lengthy waits and some crowded elevators. That's the worst I can say about it. The location was great| walking distance to theaters| Columbus Circle and nice restaurants. We will definitely try to book here again on our next visit to NYC.,Aug 28| 2019,4
Excellent. I would strongly suggest everyone..,Aug 27| 2019,5
Staff at the was horrible| i probably never X 1000 ever stay at hilton in new york ever. They were very rude a d condescending. Especially one that had scarf wrap around her head. I will also write a letter to a hilton headquarter about their service. Please stay away from this place. Service was just horrible. I also left something at the room| front desk wound help me and continue to transfer me to lost and found which no one pick up calls. Left me messages and no call back.,Aug 26| 2019,1
Got tired of waiting for the elevators. They really need to be upgraded.,Aug 20| 2019,4
The heavy perfume in the building made me gag each time I entered.  The ac blew straight toward the bed and on me all night.  Very uncomfortable. Elevators very slow.  You get what you pay for - this is a budget hotel so I wasn't  surprised. The location of the hotel is subpar because the  street is dirty and ugly.  I wont stay there again.,Aug 18| 2019,2
Stay was good. Location worked out well for whatI did.,Aug 15| 2019,4
Location was awesome! Most of the staff was friendly and helpful,Aug 15| 2019,5
The location was good| but No transportation to and from Laquardia airport.,Aug 15| 2019,3
Check in was very busy. Took a long time seemed understaffed,Aug 14| 2019,4
Great location| friendly/helpful staff| sometimes slow elevator service.,Aug 13| 2019,4
Staff are welcoming and kind. The room was spacious and clean.  Thanks for a great stay,Aug 13| 2019,5
Room was clean but small.  Great Location!!  Lobby was also small and very few places to sit and be comfortable.  Check in was terrible| three different times between 3:30 and 5| we were told our room would be ready in 30 minutes.  Thanks to one front desk staff person| Maria| who ran after us and apologized| took our telephone number and called us when our room was ready.  Poor management| and communication with housekeeping.,Aug 12| 2019,3
Enjoyed the location and service| would stay here again.,Aug 11| 2019,5
Expedia ROB / took my money cause they booked the wrong date and told me they will not give me none of my my back.  Please people don’t booked with these online company  booked with the hotel  not with 3rd parties I am out 170$ no money back & no room we work to hard for our. Money to give it away.   Sorry but I feel very disrespected and I’m doing my best to fight it with my bank to get my money back DONT BOOKED WITH TEHM. call the hotel and booked with them never with a 3rd party.,Aug 6| 2019,1
LIKED: LOCATION| AMENITIES LIKE FRIG & MICRO| ACCESS TO LAUNDRY MACHINE| IRONDID NOT LIKE: ROOM TOO SMALL> DIFFICULT TO GET OUT OF BED ON ONE SIDE| NOT ENOUGH SPACE FOR HANGING CLOTHES| NO GLASS OR CERAMIC MUGS FOR TEA & COFFEE| NO WINE GLASS| BATHROOM HAS NO VANITY OR SHELVES TO PLACE TOILETRIES| THERE IS AN IRONING BOARD BUT NO PLACE TO USE IT.,Aug 4| 2019,4
The staff was very accommodating and friendly. Although| I feel the hotel is a little pricey for the property and for there not to be a pool.,Aug 2| 2019,3
Location was great. Food was so so. Staff was vert friendly abmnd helpful.,Aug 2| 2019,5
It was great overall| the AV was a little hit or miss,Aug 1| 2019,4
Room was very clean and close to everything.  The room was small for a family of 4 though. We kept having to crawl over beds to get were we wanted to go as the aisle in the room had a desk and chair that stuck out.,Jul 31| 2019,4
Friendly staff| comfortable| nice amenities. Everything as expected,Jul 31| 2019,5
My daughter and I went to NYC to visit the consulate for a visa. An important document arrived just minutes before our appointment. The routers in the business center were not working so we went to the front desk for help printing out our documents. The staff went above and beyond to assist us and get us out the door on time. We arrived in a heat wave and they had provided a "cooling station" of ice water|  complimentary Italian ice and a fridge full of chilled hand towels- very thoughtful. The location and room were great. Dinner next door at PepperSteak was delicious! The breakfast that was included far exceeded my expectations! Overall- excellent experience.,Jul 29| 2019,5
Awesome Service Excellent Very good Will be back,Jul 27| 2019,5
On the plus side| the room was clean| linens high quality| pillows nice| and air conditioning was good and cold. However| glass shower door was coming loose from the wall| very dangerous| the iron didn’t heat past being a hand warmer| the clothes dryer| after an hour wait| produced cold wet clothes| and the complimentary wi fi was nonexistent.,Jul 27| 2019,3
Location is amazing. Friendly staff.  Two queen beds were great.  Hotel very quiet.,Jul 27| 2019,5

Very friendly staff| great location snd good size rooms,Jul 21| 2019,5
Everything about the hotel was great- especially the location. The elevators were very slow during particular times of the day.,Jul 19| 2019,4
Good central location in Manhattan. Breakfast was included with our particular room| and was tasty although mostly the same every day. Two queen size beds were nice (many NYC rooms have double beds) although in our room the floor space was very limited as a result.,Jul 19| 2019,5
Shower has a low water flow| air conditioner engine is located near the bed and made some noise all night long. there was no hot water in the beginning but that was fixed after a while. during the fix| the sink turned out to be blocked ..but that was fixed also. to summarize it....not the best experience,Jul 16| 2019,3
Staff was friendly and helpful. Elavators were very slow.,Jul 16| 2019,4
Great location. We had a little cute room. Upon our arrival I realized that the refrigerator wad not cooling well| one phone call and 20 min later we got a new one. Excellent customer service. I did not park at hotel valet parking| I parked at the parking located practically in front of the hotel via SpotHiro App,Jul 16| 2019,5
Great location - clean & quiet room. Recommended !,Jul 11| 2019,5
Good area within walking distance to Times Square and other tourist attractions. Front desk staff is pretty aloof and rooms are not sound proofed as I could hear people voices in corridor very clearly as well as the sound of doors opening and closing.,Jul 10| 2019,3
Location was great. Staff eager to assist. First trip for 15 yr old daughter and my 49 ye old boyfriend great overall!!,Jul 9| 2019,5
During peak times| the elevators are very slow in arriving.  Close to subway and things we wanted to walk to.,Jul 6| 2019,4
Everything was very pleasant| no complaints at all.,Jul 4| 2019,5
Friendly| accommodating staff! Clean| comfortable room!,Jul 3| 2019,5
Hotel lacked amenities like restaurants a fully equipped gym room service etc,Jun 27| 2019,3
The staff were very friendly & helpful.  The rooms were perfect-clean| comfortable| modern.  And we had a nice view of the city| as we aslked for.,Jun 20| 2019,5
Very close to time square.  Easy check in.  Nice rooms.,Jun 20| 2019,5
Fantastic location| lovely staff. Having a coffee machine and microwave and access to a laundry was great| especially for a longer stay.Didn't like the use of disposable cups etc. Although there was a microwave| there were no implements except cups. No bowls or plates| no cutlery. Had to ask for them and they were single-use disposables. Bad for the environment.,Jun 19| 2019,5
Met my son in NYC and we had the best time.  The location of the hotel was perfect.  Close to the shows on Broadway| an easy walk to Central Park and to USS Intrepid Museum.  Many places to eat within walking distance.  Would stay here again on my next visit.,Jun 18| 2019,5
The front desk is very friendly and helpful.,Jun 17| 2019,5
This was a nice place with easy access to most of the attractions.  Getting information about the city was almost nonexistent.  But the staff was pleasant enough. Overall pretty decent place.,Jun 17| 2019,4
We had a wonderful first time in NYC experience and this hotel was a big part of it. Perfect location as it is close enough to get to everything and just out of the mix enough to be just out of it. A few blocks to times square one way and a couple blocks to Central Park the other way and the subway station is also right there. We found our favorite deli for breakfast or lunch (Premiere Deli) being right near this location and our favorite local bar to watch a game too (Faces and Names). LOVED both of them| repeatedly. The bar and restaurant located inside the hotel was fine| we just opted to have our NYC food experience outside of the hotel. We are already planning on our return visit and would like to stay here again. The staff was outstanding and the room/service was great.,Jun 16| 2019,5
Great location. Friendly staff and reasonable sized room for NYC.Pleasant decor in room but minimal extras- paper cups no glasses.Very slow lift.,Jun 16| 2019,4
All the stall were very nice. The room was very clean. However| when I plugged in my phone charger| the outlet sparked and the other one didn’t work.,Jun 13| 2019,4
Hotel staff was very friendly.  Rooms were small but very clean and comfortable.  Location was 5-10 minute walk to Times Square.,Jun 10| 2019,5
Ok location| small rooms| terrible customer service. Not worth paying over 300 for one night,Jun 10| 2019,2
Great location| very attractive and well maintained. My only complaint was the slowness of the elevators| with lines of people waiting. -- Not sure if it even could be avoided in mid-town Manhattan.,Jun 6| 2019,5
The hotel's great| with one exception. The elevator system is horrendous| with frequent unreasonably long waits for an elevator to come. They even have signs up by the elevators on each floor| warning of "long wait times." Can't they just fix it or add more?,May 28| 2019,4
The Air Conditioner didn't work even after they said it was fixed 2x & they said they can't refund my money cause I prepaid they Expedia. Then I was told I would get 3|000 points on an Hilton Honors rewards card which I didn't even have cause I don't usually book directly thru the hotel as it's way more expensive but I still haven't gotten those posting points either so I am really upset.,May 28| 2019,1

The bathroom door in our room would not shut. It was a sliding door| that constantly slipped open. There was no catch/magnet to prevent it from so doing.We contacted reception| who said an engineer would be up. After half an hour| I went to reception to ask about the engineer. When finally he turned up| he said that they were designed the same way throughout the hotel (something| we later found to be untrue)| and he wasn't sure what he could do. I explained a simple fix| but he said he had to consult someone about it and went away.We never saw him again.In the mean time| we found the "hanging space" in the closet. it was approximately 8" wide| and a 2 FEET DROP.I went back to reception and told him about the both the door and the closet space. Again| I was told that the design was same throughout the hotel| nevertheless I asked to be moved to a different room. I was told this was no problem| but as the hotel was full| we'd have to wait for two days. We could| however| see the room the next morning to ensure that we were happy with it.The next morning we went to reception| only to be told that they knew nothing about it. Fortunately| the concierge was still able to allocate a new room and we moved the following day.The second room was adjacent to the first| but much better. Contrary to what I had been told| there was a hinged door on the bathroom| and reasonable hanging space.,May 26| 2019,3
Great location. Clean facility. Friendly helpful staff.,May 21| 2019,5
Problems with the elevators caused delays of as much as 20 minute waiting.,May 20| 2019,3
Ok place not really to many complaints ; customer service was ok,May 13| 2019,4
Staff friendly; rooms decent size and clean; great location... would recommend and return.,May 11| 2019,5
Clean hotel| views can be nice with the city-view rooms.,May 11| 2019,5
PERFECT location| really clean hotel. Basic in nature but for first timers to NYC| it was ideal,May 9| 2019,4
Room was small| the elevators’ waiting time was too long but other than that the hotel was convenient| clean and a walking distance to central park and to Times Square which is great.,May 8| 2019,4
It was a girl’s trip for my sister’s 50th Birthday. I was a little worried because of reviews of wait times for elevators| which we did not find to be hardly a problem at all. Rooms were clean and comfortable| and staff was pleasant and helpful. The Hotel was in quieter location| but so conveniently located to Times Square| Central Park etc. Felt like a safe location.We enjoyed it very much and would stay there again in a heartbeat. It was a lucky find|and though we paid a little more because we didn’t book so far ahead| it is an even better value if you do. We have stayed at fancier hotels in New York| but were very pleasantly surprised with the Hilton Garden Inn.,May 7| 2019,4
the terrace was nice but could have been cleaner.  Bottle full of cigarette butts not welcoming,May 6| 2019,5
location| fruit water and treats| coffee in the lobby| friendly staff!Decent gym:),May 3| 2019,5
Good overall. Clean| updated|and Modern. Room was small but comfortable. Location was great| just a few short blocks from Times Square. My only complaint was the noise. Someone close to our room had a baby that literally cried nonstop all night.,May 1| 2019,4
Good location if you are interested in the Times Square area or Central Park.  Clean rooms.  Decent number of elevators.  Small lobby,Apr 30| 2019,4
The front desk staff were excellent| friendly| efficient| professional ... same for the restaurant staff ... really great!,Apr 30| 2019,5
Great hotel and great location.  Very clean!  Staff pleasant and helpful.I will be back :-),Apr 29| 2019,5
The hotel is in a great location| just far enough away from Times Square to offer a little bit of quiet. You can walk to Times Square within 8 minutes. The hotel and staff are great. Only negative is the wait for the elevators is pretty long| no matter the time of day.,Apr 25| 2019,4
The gal at the front desk is why I didn't give this a great rating.  She was really unwelcoming and made me feel bad upon checking in... more like a robot.  The rooms are a bit small but it is NY so expected it.  The rest was good.,Apr 24| 2019,4
Excellent location. Nice size rooms for New York. Elevators can be quite slow at times. Staff are very friendly except overnight staff.,Apr 23| 2019,5
Great location| friendly staff| comfortable and quiet,Apr 23| 2019,4
It was a very comfortable stay. I'm the Princess from Hans Christian Andersen's book: "The Princess and the Pea|" so I can tell you that the pillows and mattress on our king size bed was very comfortable.,Apr 17| 2019,4
Our room was not cleaned till 5 pm when we got back. The safe kept jamming up on us until they drilled the lock! No pool! No breakfast !,Apr 16| 2019,3
This property has (1) overwhelming issue which mutes any other positives. It was not built with sufficient elevator service. There are 30+ floors and only (3) elevators| and as usual at lease (1) elevator breaks down on a regular basis leaving you with just (2) elevator and sometime even (1) at which point you can expect to wait 10-15 minutes for an elevator. On my second day there were no elevators and i had walk down from the 32nd Floor. I strongly recommend not booking this property unless they guarantee you a room on the lower floors.,Apr 14| 2019,1
Location awesome.  Rooms could use some updating but otherwise very clean. Staff was excellent.  Our only issue was the elevators.  There are 3 in the small hotel lobby. During our eight day stay maybe two days all three elevators worked.  A few days only one.  Took 10 minutes usually to get on the elevator and people squeezed in so hot and overcrowded.  I’ve have been stuck on an overcrowded elevator and it’s not pleasant so I had major anxiety each time we got on one.  One evening my husband and I walked down 24 flights from our room so as not to be late for a dinner reservation.  Around our fifth day moved to a lower floor so we could use stairs. Not sure why in NY a hotel such as the Hilton cannot have properly working elevators especially after eight days.  Since we spent quite a bit of time on the elevator(s) spoke with staff members.  Said morale was low among employees because of management. They did a most admirable job. We will not stay here again.  I called Hilton while we were there and was told essentially it was not their problem it was the individual property’s problem.,Apr 14| 2019,2
Could not get ice.  Machine not working.  Also| elevators slow..,Apr 11| 2019,3
Two of the three elevators were not working for at least 36 hours.,Apr 10| 2019,4
The room was very spacious and clean feeling. All the usual amenities (refrigerator| microwave| safe| etc) were organized in a way that made the room feel cozy and more likes studio apartment than a hotel room. The hotel is in a convenient location- walking distance to many NYC sites.,Apr 9| 2019,5
Two out of the three elevators were not working and the third was having difficulty. Staff did not compensate us for any inconvenience,Apr 8| 2019,1
Average hotel; not very suitable for business; relatively high price for what you get.,Apr 8| 2019,3
Everything went very smoothly. The staff was exceedingly attentive and polite.  We felt very welcomed.,Apr 2| 2019,5
The picture of the room is very misleading.  The people at the front desk greeted individuals that were not of African American decent.  The lobby was dated. This hotel was very misleading.,Apr 1| 2019,1
Staff was very helpful. Rooms were spacious and comfortable,Mar 31| 2019,4
Location was excellent and staff extremely friendly and helpful. Rooms are small but workable and similar to other NYC hotels. Beds are hard and not very comfortable and they only supply cardboard cups| no glasses.,Mar 31| 2019,4
I loved having a washing machine and dryer that I could use to clean my own laundry. The biggest detraction was the elevators that were far too few and too slow for the size of the hotel. Thankfully we were on the second floor and could walk up and down the stairs.,Mar 30| 2019,4
The property was within walking distance to everything.  It was very quiet at night as well.,Mar 29| 2019,4
A brand new and well maintained hotel with exquisite staff at all e to levels| truly concern for our comfort ‘Twas a specially prosessional in addressing the not functioning the heater problem and resolved in minutesConfortable super. Clean close,Mar 16| 2019,5
Great location   Long wait for elevators.  Clean room,Mar 15| 2019,4
The hotel is very nice| front desk staff were great| and the location is perfect. Our stay was only interrupted by very loud service staff that kept yelling and bumping into our walls while cleaning the room next door. The door handles are also very loud when they shut and a guest was given the wrong room number (ours) and tried to get into our room one night. It’s a good New York hotel| but a couple little changes could have made it great.,Mar 12| 2019,3
Great location & service was outstanding. Very professional,Mar 12| 2019,5
Wished this hotel had a pool or hot tub. For NY we were pleasantly surprised at the room size.,Mar 11| 2019,4
They should add more elavator.  It was slow and busy,Mar 11| 2019,4
close to everything..especially the theatres and central park,Mar 10| 2019,4
The elevator so slow and take long time to get into.,Mar 9| 2019,4
I liked everything about the hotel| except for the water pressure. It was horrible,Mar 7| 2019,4
Very nice property...GREAT mid-city location away from the Times Square craziness and close walking distance to subway and Central Park.  Be prepared to wait for an elevator during morning check-out and afternoon check-in.  Bonus of a very nice steak house next door| two taverns across the street along with a CRUNCH gym.  Only negative was the pillows were way too soft and I needed to use 2 or 3 to get any firmness.  Historical note:  the original Studio 54 is on the same block and is now a theater,Mar 6| 2019,5
Excellent hotel - highly recommended: lovely| friendly staff comfortable well appointed room . received a very warm and inviting greeting upon my very late  arrival  after challenging travel - all of which was just what I needed. Will would return happy !,Feb 27| 2019,4
The rooms are spacious for 2 people. it was comfortable.  would have liked clean sheet every day but that would be my only complaint.  it was a nice location with good staff.  loved the coffee every morning in the lobby.  the creamers are a great touch!  would highly recommend this hotel.,Feb 25| 2019,4
We stayed here for a family weekend trip.The service was great| everybody we spoke to was very nice. The rooms came with a great view of the city and it's a Hilton so the beds are always extremely comfortable. We were only a few blocks from Times Square| Central Park| and the nearest subway station. Very close to shopping and restaurants.The only bad thing was that the bathroom door did not close all the way which was kind of weird. It was a sliding door and it left about 5 inches to spare; obviously no privacy.Other than that| this was a nice hotel and I would stay again.,Feb 25| 2019,5
Good location.  Elevators take a long time so plan accordingly if you need to be somewhere on time.,Feb 24| 2019,4
Great location| very friendly and helpful staff. The rooms are more than adequate with really good showers. The beds are very comfortable but the pillows are really soft. Staff are very efficient.,Feb 22| 2019,5
Clean and well organized. The staff are friendly and understanding-they checked me in before the scheduled time.I appreciated the respectful treatment!Well done Stuff at front desk!!!,Feb 22| 2019,5
Amazing location with many bars and restaurants nearby.,Feb 19| 2019,4
Room we had was good however air con was noisy and when coming on during the night was so noisy continuslly woke me from my sleep.Resorted to switch it off and ask for additional blankets.Cannot fault the staff especially housekeeping.Over all would use this hotel again with no hesitation ideally located. Nice touch was hot beverages in foyer in the morning.,Feb 18| 2019,4
Reserved room was not available. Highly disappointed.,Feb 18| 2019,1
Great location near central park south| broadway theater| and (comfortable distance from) times square.,Feb 18| 2019,4
You pay for the location. Reception stuff is rude and not helpful. Once checked in they took 300 USD as a deposit which I think should be disclosed in advance. Also upon leaving I asked where I could get a yellow taxi and the porter just took my suitase and tried to get me into the black hotel cab which would charge me double. That is dischonest.,Feb 14| 2019,3
Room was clean but different things didn't work.  One of the three elevators was blocked more than once| making trips up to our 19th floor room quite slow at times.  We were given expired $15 credits to use with the Curb taxi app.  When we pointed out they were expired we were given more codes for smaller discounts that were also all expired.  It took forever to get hot water in the shower (low water pressure| too) and we never had it in the sink.  When we asked for this and the pressure to be fixed they said they sent someone but it was never altered.  Staff were friendly but again didn't resolve problems.  Coffee machine didn't work and we didn't report it because we were tired of wasting time in line to report things that weren't resolved.  Location is good and room was clean| however too small for a two double bed room - there wasn't enough floor space for two suitcases.,Feb 13| 2019,3
Great service| great location and price. Will definitely stay again.,Feb 13| 2019,5
Room wasn’t ready; room was extremely small with hardly any walking space; elevators were very slow.,Feb 12| 2019,2
Check in was excellent and fast. Very friendly and efficient staff. Very helpful with advice and directions. Nothing too much trouble.The room was very clean| house keeping staff also very friendly and obliging. Location excellent| bed very comfortable| room updated| aircon which worked really well,Feb 12| 2019,5
Great| central location with superb city skyline views.  Easy walks to subway lines| Central Park| Times Square.  Bars| restaurants and shopping are all nearby as well.  Excellent business center and helpful staff. Great base for a trip to NYC.,Feb 9| 2019,5
Lovely hotel in a perfect location! Very comfy modern rooms| big king bed and super friendly staff! We were a 5 minute walk from Times Square and Central Park and 2 minutes from a subway station| it was ideal for getting around the city. I would definitely stay here again!,Feb 6| 2019,5
It’s a nice room and we got upgraded to a kind bed| but the shower door didn’t close. It seemed the door was too big and wasn’t constructed properly. Also the elevator took over 15 minutes. On our last morning| there was an extremely loud steam-like whistle coming from the walls. Someone came very promptly to check it out though| which I appreciated. Overall 3.5/5,Feb 5| 2019,4
great location and good value.  Have to wait a long time for elevators.,Feb 4| 2019,4
We had to move rooms 3 times due to noise. The first was because we had an ajoining room and our neighbors were up all night. They moved us to a "quieter room" only to be woken uo by a construction worker on the other side of our walling drilling and hammering in the early morning. We moved once more and ended up in another ajoining room which was just as loud as the first. Staff (except for one loveky girl) are apathetic. Ammenities are minimal. Restaurant is sub par. Would not recommended. Theres much better in NYC for a similar price.,Feb 3| 2019,1
Good central location to shops| restaurants.Small space| lobby area. Elevator wait time was appalling!  5-8 minutes each time for elevator.,Feb 3| 2019,2
Quick stay for work. Nice bar/restaurant with good food and service,Feb 2| 2019,5
Great location and clean rooms with comfortable beds. Long waits for elevator and loud staff.,Feb 2| 2019,4
Fun weekend in NY,Feb 1| 2019,4
Rooms a little on the small side.  Elevator service can be very slow.  Common areas need a little updating.,Feb 1| 2019,4
Great location| friendly staff.  Our room was the smallest hotel room we've ever had| despite being Hilton Honors member and requesting upgrade.,Jan 29| 2019,4
Room was not ready at check in (3:00).  When I patiently waited till 5:30.. they told me they had no rooms available with two queen beds..  which I booked and got confirmation weeks before.We were finally offered 2 separate rooms which was unacceptable but we had no choice... very disappointed!,Jan 28| 2019,2
The location is convenient for shows. The room was clean. The bed linens didn’t seem fresh but I was able to get some new ones. The elevators get very crowded and slow at certain times.,Jan 28| 2019,4
Convenient to Times Square and rooms are very clean. There’s a mini fridge| microwave and keurig in the room.,Jan 26| 2019,5
The hotel is in an excellent location and I can't fault the hotel except for the lifts.  There was 1 of the 3 lifts out of action.  This means one could wait 15 minutes for the lift to arrive.,Jan 22| 2019,4
More than adequate for biz travel for me and my accompanying husband. Tiny room for 2 people| even for New York.  Bed took up most of the space.,Jan 20| 2019,4
The staff at the Hilton were so polite and helpful. We appreciated the mosaic of attractive employees who went out of their way to treat us well. My wife felt the Hilton must employee the nicest people in New York :-),Jan 20| 2019,5
Everything was perfect except the pillows were too soft and gave me a headache both nights. I should have asked for different ones.,Jan 20| 2019,5
Great hotel with great front desk help the entire trip!!,Jan 12| 2019,5
Hotel is perfectly located| great food options around| a few blocks north is Central Park and a few blocks south is Times Square. Subway stations are close by.  Hotel is super clean and newly renovated.,Jan 11| 2019,5
Not enough water to drink. Only 3 elevator.  It took so long waiting on the elevator.  A complimentary breakfast would be nice.,Jan 9| 2019,5
Room was good| staff was great. Just barely has enough elevators so ehen we arrived and 1 was down the lobby was over crowdwd and chaotic. Took 20 minutes from front drsk to get on the elevator.,Jan 7| 2019,3
Very active area| but so nice to be close to so many subway stops| easy to get around!  Very clean room.,Jan 5| 2019,5
I really liked the location of the building. The friendly staff made me feel welcomed. My vacation was worthwhile by living in this location. Thanks,Jan 5| 2019,5
I was very pleased with our stay here. Great location| room and staff. I recommend.,Jan 5| 2019,5
It’s very clean| spacious| and comfortable accommodation. If I go to NY next time| I want to stay here.,Jan 4| 2019,5
everything was greatclean room courteous staffhelpful with directions,Jan 4| 2019,5
Good location in between central park and times square. Comfy beds and pillows. Other than that| hotel is average considering the price you pay.If you enjoy waiting 10-15 minutes for the elevator then this is the hotel for you. Foyer is so small it is always overcrowded. Noise is easily heard from adjoining rooms and showers are crappy.On the plus side there are washing machines and dryers downstairs you can use for a few dollars. No laundry detergent provided though (of course). Business centre with free printing is handy too,Dec 31| 2018,3
Great location and hotel was good. Very convenient for seeing New York.,Dec 29| 2018,4
Please have a lock in the bathroom door. It's really really inconvenient,Dec 26| 2018,4
The valet service hit my car and didn't tell me until I was checking out there's they say they will pay for any damages but I doubt it and it's not like I drive a cheap car it is a 2018 BMW M550 If the property and the valet service do not repair my vehicle I will never ever stay there again,Dec 25| 2018,1
.great location| quiet and nice staff  would definitely return,Dec 20| 2018,5
Great room| comfy bed. Coffee maker| microwave and fridge.Restaurant next door is overpriced and loud. Not a great block.Friendly staff.,Dec 19| 2018,3
Room was clean and quiet.,Dec 18| 2018,4
The elevators kept breaking down. Very annoying to stand in small lobby with large crowd waiting for an elevator,Dec 18| 2018,4
The close proximity to Central Park and restaurants,Dec 15| 2018,5
Great location for access to Central Park| Broadway and Times Square. Room very comfortable| but most do not have a bathtub. Staff very polite and helpful. Elevators become very busy at times.,Dec 14| 2018,4
Lovely hotel in a fantastic location. All of the team are friendly and helpful| most importantly the hotel was immaculate,Dec 10| 2018,5
Nice hotel and friendly staff| walking distance for most of the main attractions. The heating system is quite noisy in the room. All in all was very pleased.,Dec 10| 2018,4
Our room was SO QUIET. I got much needed sleep. Wasn't real crazy about the sliding bathroom door that didn't really provide much privacy| but| hey| we dealt with it. The pillows were luxurious! TV was great. Bed was big & comfy. Staff was super helpful. Loved the restaurants that were close buy. Applejacks| Angelos and the little 99 cent pizza place were the ones we went to. Appreciated the storing of our bags both before check-in and after check-out so we could roam the streets unencumbered. We'll tell our friends. Great stay!,Dec 9| 2018,5
Room was incredibly small. Had to move the chair out of the room so we could walk,Dec 4| 2018,4
Good location for easy access to the subway| from either 50th Street or 7th Avenue.Room cleaning is good when its done| the daily record keeping of which rooms have been done seemed a bit haphazard on our visit.A bit more maintenance of the rooms wouldn't have gone amiss| both the bedside lights had loose fittings and the microwave oven (nice inclusion) had a rubber foot missing so wobbled quite a bit! In-house restaurant expensive though plenty of others nearby.,Dec 3| 2018,4
Location is right around the corner from the Ed Sullivan Theatre (Now The Late Show with Stephen Colbert).. Close to Times Square| Rockefeller Center| Radio City Music Hall and Carnegie Hall. Very close to Columbus Circle and Central Park. There are plenty of places to eat within a short walk.,Nov 29| 2018,5
First of all| the customer service and friendliness of the front desk staff| house keepers| concierges and bellman is phenomenal!  Nice folks and so helpful!  The room was clean and nice.  Do request a high floor; we had the 7th and sleeping was quite difficult due to street noise...all night.  Our main gripe...the elevator situation!  It is AWFUL.  They have 3 elevators for the 30 some floors but it is impossible to catch one quickly| coming or going.  It took us 25 minutes this morning to get from the 7th floor to the lobby.  If we did not have a stroller and luggage (we were headed back to the airport) we wkikd definitely had taken the stairs.  Every other day| the lobby elevators were also so stressful. As soon as one stops| folks come from all corners of the building and bombard the open elevator!  It was very unusual that there was such a lack of etiquette allowed at this property.  The connecting restaurant next door is nice and the food was very tastey but they loudly refused to allow us to take a wine glass with their wine to our room bc they claim Hilton’s guests “steal” them. Lol.  Interesting choice of words.   Maybe the hotel should invest in inexpensive glasses for the guests?  No sure how to solve that.Overall| nice stay but would not stay again because of the elevator fiasco each day.,Nov 25| 2018,4
The employees were very kind| helpful and always very courteous. The location was great and very close to the places I wanted to visit.,Nov 19| 2018,5
Extremely Friendly staff without being annoying.  Clean rooms and fitness center.  Good size room by N.Y. standards. Nice restaurant next door. Convenient to Times Square and Central Park. I would Definitely come back.,Nov 13| 2018,5
We chose the hotel for its location and it did not disappoint!  We will be back!,Nov 5| 2018,5
Loved the location and staff was super friendly. Everything was very clean. The only small thing we didn't like was the beds were fairly uncomfortable.,Nov 5| 2018,4
A good lodging.  Staff helpful.  Good location. Good rates.,Nov 2| 2018,4
Location was convenient; staff was helpful; elevators were fast,Nov 2| 2018,5
Extremely rude and inattentive staff. The only good experience was my check in experience. After that the staff were terrible,Oct 28| 2018,2
The hotel was fine and the restaurant played great music,Oct 27| 2018,4
Tiny rooms| not ideal for a family.  Asked to change rooms but hotel staff unhelpful and not interested.,Oct 27| 2018,3
Very small rooms| and noise from adjoining rooms and halls very loud.  Had to call the front desk twice to get noisy neighbors to quiet down. Location ok| very busy area.,Oct 25| 2018,4
Short overnight stay| but quite comfortable.  Professional staff!,Oct 23| 2018,5
Good location| friendly staff. Very accommodating. Clean rooms and bathroom.,Oct 19| 2018,5
The Room was so small. It takes time to reach elevators.,Oct 18| 2018,3
The hotel is nice and the staff is pleasant but I just don't get the bathroom doors| thus the low rating in "comfort." If u surveyed most people| especially women| u would find most people like privacy in the bathroom| not afforded by the "barn door" bathroom closures in place now. Also| I reported a blown bathroom light about 7:00pm and that fell on deaf ears. I had to re-report it when I came back from our night out and it didn't get fixed until midnight. The repair man was very professional and accommodating; he just never received a repair ticket. And ur parking in completely outrageous! Shame on u!,Oct 17| 2018,3
Amazing location| walking distance to the park| theater district| amazing restaurants within the same block and of course a Starbucks within minutes. Hotel was quiet and clean. Wait time for elevator can be a little long but never more than 5 mins.,Oct 13| 2018,5
This is great hotel close to many New York must sees. The rooms are small but well appointed. Having a microwave and refrigerator was really handy. The restaurant and lounge had great service and food. Friendly staff on all levels at this location. We were close to metro stops and a ton of restaurant options. Broadway was our neighbour. I would certainly recommend this hotel and I will stay here again,Oct 9| 2018,5
Darren at the front desk was great!  Very helpful and accommodating. Also very knowledgeable| his suggestions made our stay memorable.,Oct 3| 2018,4
Nice hotel....very clean. Small| but it’s NYC. Staff was good| elevator wait was not long. Would stay there again.,Sep 30| 2018,4
I recently stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn for a 5 day stay in NYC. It was the perfect base for sight-seeing and had all the comforts of home. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful with any questions we had. The check in and check out processes were seamless and fast. They even had water| coffee and snacks in the lobby each day. The room was a great size for two people with plenty of room for luggage and moving about. The fridge| microwave and coffee maker in the room were a great bonus! The bed was very comfortable which was great after a long day of walking around! The hotel is conveniently located to major attractions such as Times Square and Central Park. There is a subway stop close by to get to further locations. Some great restaurants and coffee shops nearby as well! Overall| this was an excellent hotel and I would definitely stay here again.,Sep 24| 2018,5
The staff went above and beyond to make us feel important and welcomed to the hotel! This happened each and every time we left or entered the building. If you met a staff member in the elevator| lobby or hallway they greeted you with a hello and have a great day! Superb interaction with everyone! We certainly would highly recommend this hotel to everyone and we will definitely return! Thank you for making us feel at home! Even better!!,Sep 23| 2018,5
Everything was great.  Great very friendly and helpful .  Will come back again,Sep 22| 2018,5
Our second stay was as good as the first. The Libby here is usually bustlung| a sign of the hotel's popularity. We appreciate the coffee and flavored ice water in the lobby| and staff are always very helpful. Rooms are clean| well maintained| and comfortable.,Sep 16| 2018,5
Very clean and comfortable and not at all noisy despite being in a great central location. Would definitely stay there again,Sep 15| 2018,5
This was our second stay at this property. Great location | our room was well appointed. I recommend this hotel.,Sep 15| 2018,5
Room was clean| staff was friendly. Good location.,Sep 12| 2018,4
Great location| felt safe. Parking was tough| but there are more than a few options,Sep 11| 2018,5
The stay was great and the staff was friendly. I woulddefinitely consider staying again because it is in a such a good location that it made it easier to visit many locations in NYC.,Sep 11| 2018,4
It is a hotel room for the night .  It is clean and the bed is comfortable.  In a good location for what I need,Sep 6| 2018,3
The room was very clean and comfortable| I did not miss my bed at all! The location is great. Staff were friendly and helpful. The ice water in the lobby with fruit was a nice welcome when returning from walkabouts. We enjoyed our stay.,Sep 4| 2018,5
Hotel is quite compact. Rooms are small - little room around bed. Staff were great and helpful. Advertised as free wifi| but it would not work on my phone. Front desk gave me a free upgrade normally only available to their club member guests. Appears this happens quite often - why have two different levels of wifi?,Sep 2| 2018,4
Great Place to stay in the heart of all action,Sep 1| 2018,4
The hotel itself was nice.  The staff was friendly.  However| the room was awful. There was a huge gnat problem in our room.  There were a lot of gnats on the shower walls.  Some one from the maintenance crew came to clean the shower drain| after which the gnats started coming into the room.  The next morning the shower walls  had more gnats.  We will NEVER stay at that location again.,Sep 1| 2018,2
The pressure of cold water was too low and thus the water temperature was high.  The bed was so squeaky whenever I changed my position.,Aug 28| 2018,4

My mom and I had a wonderful overnight stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The room was clean and the size was fine. The only complaint I have is with the pillows. The pillows were very flat.,Aug 25| 2018,4
Very accommodating! Highly recommended! Staff extremely nice and helpful. Room was beautiful and clean and surprisingly quiet.,Aug 25| 2018,5
Elevator wait took a awhile during peak times. Sometimes volume of people was too large. We had to wait for available space inside elevator.,Aug 20| 2018,4

No volvería a este Hotel | nunca hicieron limpieza en el cuarto teníamos que sacar nuestra propia basura | muy pequeños los cuartos| pagamos con desayuno incluido y no tenían desayunos puros snacks según ellos a cambio| nunca contestan el teléfono para pedir toallas o jabones fue un problema|los colchones muy incómodos y además pulgas.,Aug 11| 2021,1
Acabamos de tener una experiencia lamentable en este hotel Hilton. Si bien| sabemos que en Nueva York las habitaciones son muy pequeñas y que era un establecimiento de 3 estrellas| nos fijamos mucho en los comentarios y tuvimos una sorpresa total. Lo que más me impactó es que no limpien las habitaciones con la excusa de la pandemia. Esta información debían darla antes de reservar. Me pareció inconcebible estar en un hotel en el que limpien cada 5 noches y que| como gran cosa| nos dieran toallas de repuesto.Las personas| en general| fueron amables pero esto nos pareció increíble. Sabemos que los hoteles han sufrido mucho con la pandemia| pero este hotel estaba sold out y no creemos que deban buscar el ahorro de esta manera y con esa excusa.,Aug 11| 2021,1
Me encanto la localizacion| estaba a tres bloques de Times Square y de Central Park.  Hay muchos restaurantes alrededor muy convenientes.   Aunque el cuarto es un poco pequeño no nos molesto porque basicamente uno va a dormir.  El baño estaba muy comodo y limpio.  Hubo dos cosas que no nos gustaron| no limpian el cuarto todos los dias a menos que se solicite y cuando fui a solicitar la limpieza me dijeron que solo lo hacen cada 5 dias de haber estado en la habitacion ademas el servicio de los elevadores es un poco complicado en horas picos y asi lo indican en unos avisos en el elevador.   Una noche tuvimos que bajar 18 pisos porque el elevador no llegaba o cuando llegaba estaba lleno y teniamos un compromiso.  Algo adicional| aunque es algo del momento pero tampoco eran muy efectivos en reforzar a los clientes que usaran mascarilla y tuvimos que solicitar en un par de ocasiones a algunas personas que se pusieran la mascarilla.,Aug 9| 2021,4
No hacían aseo a la habitación,Aug 7| 2021,5

Muy sucio| nadie apoya| no hacen limpieza,Jul 26| 2021,1
El hotel excelente ubicación| espacio en la habitación (estuvimos en habitación doble| dos camas) y las habitaciones desinfectadas por temas de Covid| con sello de limpieza.Mis únicas observaciones son que no te ofrecen limpieza diaria de la habitación| puedes pedirla pero solo si te hospedas 5 noches en adelante y que solo son 2 elevadores para 30 pisos| se llenan un poco.Muy cercano a varias estaciones de Metro| al Central Park y también a Time Squares.,Jul 24| 2021,4
Great bedroom,Jul 23| 2021,4
El hotel con muy buena ubicación y comodo pero falto servicio de limpieza en los cuartos | entiendo las restricción pero en 6 dias que estuvimos en el hotel no fueron ni un dia a limpiar y a llevar nuevas toallas | uno tenia que pedirlo en el lobby,Jul 23| 2021,4
Bad service| we paid for breakfast and it was awful| no coffee| it was a frozen bagel and there was nothing to hear it on. The room had no towel hanger| we were 4 people and we only got 3 towels and when we asked for the fourth we didn’t get it.,Jul 21| 2021,1
Las alfombras muy sucias,Jul 20| 2021,4
Very good location (done with the pros). Due the pandemic the cleaning service is done once every 5 days (that is was we were told)| but for our stay of 6 days the room was never cleaned| we even ask for the service and no luck. We also asked for new bedding as the one we got smelled funny| and that took us 3 calls to the lobby. We got new towels becuase we ask for them to the cleaning crew we meet at the corridor (nice people| very apologetic of the situation). We added 100 USD to our reservation so it can include breakfast| big error... The "breakfast" consists on rock frozen mini sandwiches that only get thawed by 5 mins in  the room's microwave| fruit bars and juice. I know that is our fault but the room we reserved was about 120 sq feet with 2 full beds so as you can imagine it was impossible to even walk without bumping with the furniture| 2 people trying to move in the room at the same time it cant be done.,Jul 14| 2021,2
Très bien située. Chambre un peu petite mais très propre et une bonne literie.,Jul 11| 2021,5
Lo mejor del hotel es su céntrica localización.  La habitación es pequeña pero es limpia y la cama es cómoda.,Jul 2| 2021,4

No nos dijeron que no había servicio de limpieza durante toda la estancia y eso me parece una exageración| porque la persona puede entrar con guantes y cubrebocas y hace la habitación sin ningún riesgo para ninguna de las partes.,May 4| 2021,3
Me fue muy bien| las habitaciones son amplias y modernas y en mi caso Estuve en el piso 34 con vista a la ciudad y fue excelente . Durante el covid posiblemente por medidas no hicieron aseo en 9 días eso fue lo negativo,Apr 20| 2021,5

Останавливались на одни сутки. Расположение отеля достаточно удобное для прогулок в сторону Централ парка и 5-й авеню. В период COVID-19 в отеле не работал ресторан| впрочем как и все рестораны Нью-Йорка. Рядом расположены продуктовые магазины. В номере достаточно просторно| что для НЙ не характерно.Чайник и кофейны принадлежности в номере в наличии. В душевой мыло| шампунь| лосьон для тела.,Jan 20| 2021,3

생각보다는 좁지 않았어요그러나 무료로 제공하는 커피도 .. 로비에 비치하지 않았고 조식을 호텔에서 제공하는 10달러 바우처..그것마저도 가치가 떨어지는..것으로 제공하고 직원들의 친절함도 떨어지네요.위치 좋은것 빼면 별로였어요,Sep 27| 2020,5
Excelente servicio! La limpieza fue impecable| y su ubicación es perfecta!!! A solo pasos de Times Square y Central Park.,Sep 26| 2020,5
맨하탄에 있는 숙소라 일단 방과 복도 다 매우 작고 좁습니다. 복도가 너무 좁고 방이 작은 편이라 방음에 취약하지 않을까 했는데| 역시나 옆 방에 사람이 들어오니 그 말 소리가 다 들리더라구요. 요즘 코로나라 1층 레스토랑에서 야외에 테이블을 두고 영업응 해서 호텔 입구를 찾기 어려울 수도 있습니다. 입구가 잘 안보이거든요. 또 코로나 때문인지 직원들이 유리벽 세우고 그 뒤에서 눈 내리깔고 있습니다. 사람들 오고갈 때 눈을 마주치거나 인사하지 않아요. 아마 소리내어 인사하는 것도 부담이 되어서 그럴 거라고 생각합니다. 호텔의 위치나| 청결상태| 여러가지 부분은 괜찮았습니다.,Sep 23| 2020,4

Veldig sentralt og greit hotell. Kort vei til det meste og helt greie rom. Rent og pent.,Mar 1| 2020,4
空港への送迎バス（有料）があるのでここを選びました。サービスカウンターの方がとてもフレンドリーで、あれこれ教えてくれるし、博物館やミュージカルのチケットも買え、とても便利。１階にはコーヒーサービスもあります。部屋は日本のビジネスホテルからすると少し広い程度ですがコーヒーメーカーと電子レンジ、冷蔵庫がありました。とても便利なロケーションですが、外の賑やかさは部屋の中まで聞こえます。音が気になる方にはうるさいかも。,Mar 1| 2020,4

私が気に入ったのは、友人宅やコロンバスサークルまで歩け、地下鉄が近いなどの立地の良さや、リフォームされて新しい洗面台が広くて物が沢山置けること。冷蔵庫、電子レンジ、コーヒーメーカーがあったことです。ロビーにも朝は飲み物、午後はクッキーなどがありました。その反面、朝と夕方のピーク時はエレベーターが10分ほど来ないことや、部屋の暖房の音がものすごく大きいこと、ベッド周りが狭く、椅子も１つしかなく机に向かってしか置けません。ベッドと形が合わない四角い木の枠で何度も足をぶつけてあざができたことなど、挙げれば沢山あります。最も気分が悪かったのは、引き出しに入れておいたポーチを盗まれたとこです。8泊したので充電器や薬、化粧品や洋服をタンスや引き出しにしまっておいたのですが、帰る前日にポーチが無くなっていることに気づきました。価値はないけど、新しくて可愛くて気に入っていたのでショックでした。英語でフよりますがロントに訴えることもできないのであきらめました。貴重品は金庫に入れ、スーツケースは毎日鍵をかけてでかけましたが、まさかポーチを盗られるとは。やはり面倒でも毎回しまわないとだめですね。あと、廊下が思いっきりココナッツの香りなので、苦手な人は無理です。フロント対応は普通。シャワーの水圧は強くはないけど許容範囲です。アメニティはニュートロジーナの固形石鹸2個シャンプーリンス、ボディローションのみですが毎日サプライされます。タオルは三人分あります。アメニティは細いボトルが一本ずつ。ベッド周りは狭いですが、部屋に入ったところがタイル張りで広いので、大きなスーツケースも余裕でおけます。ベッドはとても広いので2人でもいいですが、座る場所がないのでつかいにくいかも。地下にはランドリーもあるようです。リゾート代金はありません。以上、古くてどうにもならないところを色々な物を付加してカバーしようとしているホテルです。何を優先して選ぶかによりますが、個人的には立地、レンジや冷蔵庫やコーヒーメーカー(コーヒー2.デカフェ1.紅茶1)は便利でした。,Feb 23| 2020,3
Elevadores ineficientes. Algumas saídas do quarto me custaram 30 minutos de espera para entrar no elevador. No dia de checkout| mesmo me antecipando ao horário previsto| saí atrasado por causa da demora dos elevadores.,Feb 21| 2020,2

Estive neste ontem em 2014 e retornei agora em 2019. Percebi uma piora no atendimento e qualidade de serviços. Chegamos pela manhã e do aeroporto fomos ao hotel. Estavamos com criança pequena. Informaram que o check-in seria as 15h e gentilmente guardaram as malas. No horário retornamos ao hotel já cansados da viagem noturna e não conseguimos fazer check-in pois o sistema estava fora do ar. Ainda tivemos que aguardar quase 2 horas. Lobby lotado| sem conforto. Elevadores sempre muito demorados. Entrega de pacotes muito falha.  O quarto continua confortável e a locaização excelente. Mas atendimento piorou bastante.,Dec 6| 2019,3

Foi muito boa. O hotel está bem localizado| o atendimento dos funcionários foi muito bom também.O único inconveniente foi o elevador| que formava filas muito grandes para termos acesso aos quartos.,Sep 30| 2019,4
O hotel é muito bem localizado. Os quartos são bons e com tamanhos bem razoáveis para os padrões de New York.  A equipe é gentil e prestativa. Entretanto| há um ponto negativo:  o hotel fornece duas garrafinhas de água grátis no primeiro dia e continua a fornecer em cada diária| com etiqueta que pode induzir ao erro de que são todas grátis| quando| na verdade|  são apenas as duas primeiras. Poderiam utilizar uma sinalização mais clara de que é item pago| evitando surpresas no check out.,Sep 28| 2019,4
混雑時、エレベーターが極端に遅い。朝9時にホテルを出る時、10分（ホントに！）経っても来なくて結局階段で降りました。9階だったのでまだ良かったけど、30階だったらどうすれば良かったのか。滞在中、2回階段使いました。,Sep 26| 2019,4

Lo único objetable es la presión de las duchas y que la puerta del baño es corrediza| entonces queda un espacio entre la pared y la puerta que no da intimidad. Peor volvería a elegir éste hotel sin dudarlo,Jun 6| 2019,5
Veldig fornøyd med oppholdet hos Hilton Garden Inn! De hadde ikke frokost| men det var mange frokostcaféer i umiddelbar nærhet med veldig god meny!! Rommet var romslig (til NY å være) og ryddig og rent. Aircondition bråket noe da den slo seg på| men ikke et stort problem.Ekstremt bra beliggenhet| med 10min gange til Times Square| samme til Central Park og 5th avenue (Apple Store/Trump Tower etc). Og ikke minst; 5-10 min gange til Theater District og Hell’s Kitchen med mange koselig restauranter av alle slag (amerikanske| mexicanske| italienske| indiske og mange flere)!!!Subway var også rett i nærheten| 3 streets unna; 5min.Anbefales!,May 31| 2019,4
Localização excelente! Quartos ótimos com microondas e mini geladeira!,May 30| 2019,5

Encontrar um hotel com um bom custo beneficio não é tarefa fácil em NY| pesquisei e comparei por muitos dias hoteis em NY e este Hilton foi a melhor opção. Hotel em NY não é barato!! geralmente pequenos!! Este Hilton oferece por umvalor inferior o que outros cobram bem mais caro e na minha opinião| comparando os quartos este é bem melhor!! A cama é Queen Size.. Ótima| o Banherio é bom. O quarto oferececofre| Geladeira| Cafeteira e Microondas(este 4 itens são raros em hoteis de NY). O Quarto não é tão grande| mas está na média dos hoteis em NY. Um diferencial é que não cobram a Taxa de Resort que podeser uma surpresa no momento do checkin!! Quarto tinha ótimas toalhas e a limpeza do quarto muito boa.A localização é perfeita| de 5 a 10 minutos de caminhada do Central park e Times Square| a meia quadra da Broadway| tem 3 estações de metro a 5 minutos| a chegada do JFK é direto pela linha E(azul) e fica a 2 quadras do hotel|a meia quadra tem uma padaria com supermercado com tudo que precisa.,May 10| 2019,5
Schlechter Service | mangelnde Ausstattung | 3 Lifts für über 30 Etagen,May 10| 2019,2

Greit hotell - fin belignhet. Rent og pent noe heiskø om morgenen.,May 6| 2019,4
O hotel está perfeitamente localizado e apresenta boas condições de acomodação. Minha única ressalva é o processe de recepção de produtos comprados pela internet. Não entregam nos quartos e não avisam que estão disponíveis. Um dos meus pedidos perdeu-se e estou tendo que negociar com o vendedor.,May 5| 2019,4

Everything great! Location| state of renovation etc.,Apr 24| 2019,5
Hotellet har ett mycket bra läge. Rummen var bra ljudisolerade. Ett stort minus var att det rum som jag bokade för fyra vuxna personer skulle ha två dubbelsängar enligt information på hotel.com. I praktiken var det två sängar som var 130 cm breda. Det fanns ingen förståelse för att detta var ett problem och ingen vilja att lösa det eller kompensera för det. De tyckte att det var hotel.com som bar ansvar för denna miss. I övrigt var det ett bra hotell.,Apr 21| 2019,3
El hotel está ubicado en una zona excepcional| entre el Central Park y Times Square Garden. Las habitaciones son comodas y están en buen estado. Lo único negativo fueron los tres ascensores. Son muy lentos y dos se rompieron mientras estuvimos hospedados| con lo cual se armaban filas de 15 minutos para poder subir a las habitaciones,Apr 13| 2019,4
Excelente localização| cordialidade e custo-benefício!,Apr 9| 2019,5
숙박하는 내도록 엘레베이터 세개중에 두개가 고장났었어요. 아침저녁마다 엘레베이터를 기다리는 시간이 오래 걸려서 불편했습니다.,Apr 9| 2019,4
Läget på detta hotell är utmärkt om man vill bo vi turistkvarteren vid Broadway och Times Square. Vi valde att betala extra för ett rum med city view vilket vi inte ångrade. Den utsikten var fantastisk. Rummet var rent  och mycket bra men man skulle önska sig en bättre toalettdörr än skjutdörren som inte är ljud eller ljustät.,Mar 17| 2019,5
La ubicación muy buena| el ascensor era rápido | personal simpático.Las instalaciones eran un poco antiguas| la puerta corrediza del baño no cerraba del todo.,Mar 17| 2019,4
A localização é excelente!!!! Muito limpo| oferecem café| chá e chocolate quente pela manhã e cookies a tarde rsVoltaria com certeza!! Perto de varias estações de metrô| dá pra fazer quase tudo andando e pra ir do jfk pro hotel é uma linha de metrô apenas| sem trocas.Adorei,Mar 12| 2019,4

Hotellet var helt ok. Det samme var renholdet. Beliggenhet var topp med nærhet til undergrunn som gjør det lett å komme seg rundt til alle severdig i New York. Et minus er dusjen| lite trykk og fast montert. Det gjør at man får en kald dusj før varmt vann kommer ut enten man vil eller ikke. Frokosten var kjedelig og lite variasjon.,Mar 3| 2019,4
Quarto limpo mas muito pequeno para duas camas de casal o ar condicionado fica muito perto da cama e faz muito barulho!! Poucos elevadores para quantidade de hóspedes!!! Localização ótimo,Feb 27| 2019,3

Excellent location. Very attentive and friedly people. Very good room amenities. Did not try restaurant or breakfast due to so many nice places around the hotel. Lobby is tiny and always crowded. Be aware not to arrive before 3pm check-in time! Only 2 elevators for 29 floors| hence| expect to wait a long time until you get one of them. Better to stay in a low floor and walk the clean and lit staircase| like I did. I will gladly book this hotel again.,Dec 11| 2018,4

Péssimo| quarto menor do que eu havia locado - equipe de recepcionistas muito ruim| fila nos elevadores| e quartos muito próximos o que torna os quartos muito barulhentos - não vale o preço.Casal de amigos alugaram pelo Booking e ficaram num quarto melhor que o meu,Nov 26| 2018,1

Tudo bom localização quarto banheiro só o lobby e muito acanhado pequeno,Nov 22| 2018,4
No shower booth| just flat floor so wet bathroom floor is structually inevitable. Must lay towels at all times. Water pressure for shower is very low possibly to prevent water from spreading further and no shower hose. Would be hard to give bath to a child. Other than that| clean and quite satisfactory.,Nov 10| 2018,4

Todella sujuva kokemus. Hotellin sijainti oli erinomainen| huoneet siistit ja henkilökunta ystävällistä.,Oct 12| 2018,5
La gente que me atendió fue muy amable pero creo que el hotel cuenta con poco personal para la cantidad de huéspedes que recibe.  No pude tomar café porque la maquina tenia un truco segun el recepcionista y tenían que subir conmigo para mostrarme como hace.. al regresar a las 8 de la noche se habían olvidado de asear la habitación. cuando lo reclamé me dijeron que vendrían enseguida. Del resto baño cómodo| los gorritos para no mojarse el pelo hay que pedirlos no están entre las amenities puestas en el baño.  La habitación limpia tamaño para una persona bueno| y la cama cómoda y confortable.,Oct 11| 2018,4
hotel bien ubicado pero mal servicio y mal pare lo que cuesta,Oct 10| 2018,2
No hubo agua caliente el primer día. El gerente no nos dio solución u opción alguna al problema. No servia la cafetera del cuarto; se reportó 3 veces y nunca lo solucionaron. No hicieron el cuarto 2 días seguidos.El pequeñísimo closet mal diseñado.Una de las llaves de la habitación dejo de funcionar.Pésimamente gerenciado. Los supervisores están de adorno. No volvería ni mucho menos lo recomendaría.,Oct 9| 2018,2

Lo mejor del hotel fue su personal| quienes desde la recepción por Lidio fue muy cordial y eficiente. incluso recibimos un obsequio al enterarse de nuestro 42 aniversario de bodas y una emotiva tarjeta de felicitación. nos hicieron sentir en familia por todas sus atenciones.

It was a great stay,Jul 15| 2020,5
Good value and location near midtown Manhattan and great for a short visit.,Jul 11| 2020,4
Everything was nice and clean ! Only the parking it to expensive for a day 57 dollars that’s a robbery.,Jul 11| 2020,5
Stayed here for 4 nights.  The beds were really comfy | rooms cleaned every day.  The bathroom was a good size .  I didn’t eat any meals here as I ate out every day.  But the location is just excellent and as a base I would highly rate this hotel. The subway is so close and the view of the Empire State is spectacular. You also had a fridge and microwave in your room!   It’s not luxury but if your looking to explore New York and want somewhere central that’s great value well then I highly recommend the Hilton garden inn west 35th!!The staff are super helpful and friendly !,Mar 17| 2020,5
Very clean. Spacious room. Centrally locates; walling distance to everything midtown has to offer. Efficient and courteous staff. Refrigerator microwave coffee maker. Nice sitting lobby. Wifi no problem. 100% will stay here again.,Mar 14| 2020,5

I loved how close this property is from everything!,Feb 25| 2020,4
The night shift front desk associate was so welcoming and amazing. Unfortunately there were some stains and sticky stuff on furniture in our room and the elevators were TERRIBLE. waited 35 minutes on an elevator when leaving. It was awful.,Feb 24| 2020,4
The elevator wasn't working properly| long wait.  Only 2 out of the 3 functioning| but wait time was an issue.,Feb 23| 2020,4
My 12-yr old grandson spent one night here while touring the city and had a wonderful time!  Room was immaculate| staff helped us order dinner to be delivered to the hotel. Great value.,Feb 23| 2020,5
Location was amazing!!! Within walking distance to everything we wanted to see. Also I found a really good deal that was Affordable for my girlfriend and me,Feb 22| 2020,4
The coffee shop was great for  a quick breakfast and it was good use of space to give a modern touch. The air conditioner did not work in our room| we froze.,Feb 20| 2020,4
The hotel itself was clean. But the front desk customer service was lacking. After we checked into our room we heard a knock and then a housekeeper let herself into the room with little explanation of what she was doing. When trying to ask her she told us that she wanted to make sure we had a “do not disturb tag” in our room. We were placed directly across from the elevators which can be noisy and when asked to move the next evening they said we can’t look into our system that far. We decided to let that go. Lastly we received a very early morning phone call letting us know we needed to update our payment info. I checked my email and noticed they tried to run my card SEVEN different times which in result flagged and shut off my card. I have stayed at many Hilton’s and Hilton garden inns and this was by far my worst experience.,Feb 19| 2020,3
They property was amazingly clean and the staff was super friendly.,Feb 19| 2020,5
Awesome stay and in the middle of everything. We walked everywhere| time square is about a 5 min walk and Around the corner from the Empire State building.,Feb 17| 2020,5

Breakfast was a bit expensive...4 dollars for coffee,Feb 16| 2020,5

Nice location| good price but need staff more friendly.,Feb 13| 2020,4
Well kept hotel with excellent staff. They very willingly allowed me to check in early so I could relax in my room before my evening plans. Hotel is in the perfect location to walk to many main attractions as well as perfectly situation near subway stops. Will stay at this location again and again!,Feb 13| 2020,5
The staff at the Hilton Garden Inn were outstanding.  The rooms were very clean and amazingly quiet for NYC.  The location was great too...right by the Empire State Building and Macy’s.,Feb 12| 2020,5
Perfect location and excellent service. I will use this hotel in the future.,Feb 12| 2020,5
Great value! Very quick check| even though we arrived early. Location was perfect. Comfortable bed. Our room| with the head of the bed| was right against the elevators| so that was a little uncomfortable. Better breakfast options would have been nice. But it was still an excellent option for the price.,Feb 12| 2020,5
I booked a king size bed room and they gave a me room with two twins side beds,Feb 7| 2020,3

Very good hotel.... is recomended.,Jan 29| 2020,5
Pam at the front desk was great,Jan 29| 2020,5
I liked the location of the property and the price.  I did not like that it didn't have valet and I was told the self park was around the block which I never did  find.,Jan 27| 2020,5
Everything was great during our stay in New York.,Jan 27| 2020,5
Really great overnight stay. Great location for MSG. Skip the breakfast. Not worth it. But restaurant across the street was very good.,Jan 26| 2020,5
Nice room in a great location. Room design and amenities were great for a pleasure trip or one person traveling on business.,Jan 25| 2020,5
The room is pretty small. I guess it's NYC. You can't ask much. The receptionist looked like doing me a big favor to check me in. The environment looked rough. Overall| I won't stay again,Jan 25| 2020,2
Right next to Empire State Building and Korean Town. Easy to navigate.,Jan 25| 2020,4

Great location| easy access to many subway lines and an easy walking distance to many attractions (Macy's| Empire State Building). Friendly staff and clean rooms. Simple| nothing fancy. My only issue was they charged my credit card for the full amount as a deposit and due to the exchange rate I lost $30 on the refund.,Jan 14| 2020,4
Great location and clean and quiet but nothing fancy,Jan 13| 2020,4

Mattress was very uncomfortable pillows were terrible,Jan 5| 2020,4
It was clean and the staff was super friendly. The location was perfect! Beds could be softer| but that’s just my taste.,Jan 5| 2020,4
Hotel is in a great central area.  It was very busy and I felt understaffed. Now| the staff that was there were very nice. Huge issue I had was not having a secure place to leave our luggage while waiting for our room.  The storage room was full so they put the overflow in the restaurant/store area. When I asked if it was locked I was told no. All employees had access to it and guest if they happen to push open the door. That is unacceptable.  Elevators were so crowded we had to take stair when we wanted to leave hotel. I guess that was the upside to being on the 3rd floor. I believe it is over priced for what you get. With so many hotels in NYC I would look around.,Jan 4| 2020,3
Great location. helpful staff. LOVE how they will allow you to leave your bags so you can explore the city. We used that service before we checked in and we checked out. Things were clean. Great safety with the keyed elevator. GREAT overall.,Jan 4| 2020,5
Refused me I was there,Jan 3| 2020,1
This is a great little hotel.  It's just a few metres from Herald Square| Penn Station| Koreatown| and a million other things.  I've stayed at this location and few times and find it to be very well managed| friendly| and clean.  While Hilton Garden is pretty good in general| there is just something "special" about this particular location.  I always look forward to staying there.,Jan 3| 2020,5
The hilton Garden Inn was very clean and spacious.  The front desk staff was friendly.  I would definitely stay here again.,Jan 2| 2020,5
Great hotel for the price!  We got two nights over New Years Eve very last minute.  The rooms were clean| comfy| and very spacious for a NYC hotel. It was conveniently located near MSG and we had a really great view of the Empire State Building!  I would definitely stay here again.,Jan 2| 2020,5
Great location - Right next to a subway station| easy access to all scenic spots.,Jan 2| 2020,5
I enjoyed my short stay for the holidays. The room was small| hard to get in out of closet . Pillows way too soft. The room overall was cozy| comfortable and clean. The gym was good for a quick workout. Loved the dining area although they did not have any bacon. Loved the Kwanzaa arrangement displayed in front of the elevators. I would definitely stay again. Close to everything| Macy’s| dining restaurants. It was a very positive experience. Had everything you need- microwave| refrigerator| safe. Very nice.,Jan 1| 2020,5
Excellent location. Great service.,Dec 30| 2019,5
Very convenient and friendly veiw could have been better,Dec 30| 2019,5
Property was to small for Hilton Garden inn !,Dec 28| 2019,2
We really love this hotel. Great location. Rooms were very clean.Staff very helpful. We definitely would book again this hotel . Happy family .,Dec 28| 2019,5
We love that the location is in the middle of popular tourist spots| close to the subway| shopping areas and restaurants. What I don’t like is the heater that wakes me up every time it turns on because it was loud for me as I slept closest to it.,Dec 27| 2019,4
The bathroom was awful!,Dec 26| 2019,3
Great staff and great hotel location.Room size was not smaller than we thought,Dec 26| 2019,5
Only issue was the parking garage. People not very friendly at all. No hellos or thank you.,Dec 24| 2019,4
The location was excellent for me to be able to go back and forth to my meetings at Penn station. Lots of food. Safe area.,Dec 21| 2019,5
Close to lots- Time Square| Macy's| Bryant Park| Broadway| Rockefeller Center!,Dec 20| 2019,4
The staff was wonderful and very accommodating to any needs. The room we had was a very good size given it’s location in downtown Manhattan.  Location was perfect! There were some issues.  Tub wouldn’t drain properly and would flood when showering.  We were only there for one night so not too much of an issue but if we were there longer and were taking more showers it would be a big problem. Another issue was the elevators.  On our arrival day| one elevator was out of service the entire time. This left just 2 to service 20+ floors.  Once nighttime rolled around| a second elevator was out of service.  Now there was one single elevator to service 20+ floors at a time when many were coming back from dinners| shows| and late night outings.  At any given moment due to the first| then the second elevator being out| you would wait over 15 minutes for an elevator to come. By the time we got up and out our second day| all three elevators were working but still took about 7-8 minutes for one to come to you.  But again staff was wonderful and space was nice and that’s all I can really ask for!,Dec 20| 2019,4
After traveling for 15 hours I was looking forward to getting to the hotel and relaxing. Upon arrival I was told that the room i specifically booked with a king bed and city view was sold out. I then told the first woman at the front desk that I spoke with someone on the phone just to be sure that my booking for that room was confirmed and they told me it was all set.  Because I didn’t write down the name of who I spoke with she laughed and said that it didn’t matter and maybe I shouldn’t book through third party sellers because specific rooms are never “guaranteed”. I travel often and have booked several hotels through third party sellers and have never had my room given away.  Then after saying she would help she passed me over to the other woman at the front desk who kept rolling her eyes at me while she proceeded to sell me on a room with double beds and tell me that someone her size could fit three times on that bed. So unprofessional and beyond rude. I was so exhausted I settled for the room with double beds which were uncomfortable| small and the room was outdated. They offered me no compensation for the inconvenience and treated me like I didn’t matter. I suggest staying elsewhere if you don’t want to feel ripped off.,Dec 19| 2019,2
This hotel has a great location to the Empire State Building| Rockefeller center| and time square. It is also close to the subway for quick travel. The only con is the hotel only has three elevators and one was requiring maintenance so the wait time for the elevator can be long. Would definitely stay there again though!,Dec 18| 2019,4
Very nice helpful staff | clean rooms great location and view of Empire State Building,Dec 18| 2019,5
Amazing rooms and great location. Rooms are nice and clean,Dec 18| 2019,5
It’s close to Macy’s and 34 th street isagood location,Dec 17| 2019,5
Good location. Very clean and service was great! Would stay again,Dec 17| 2019,5
Staff was great. I was able to leave bag so I could walk to train station to meet a girl. Check in was smoothest I I had. Check out the same. Nice employees,Dec 16| 2019,5
I did NOT like that the breakfast was not including as it was one of the reasons I choose this place.,Dec 16| 2019,2
The location was nice. Two bottles of water offered at check in after a long day of travel was nice,Dec 15| 2019,5
Male desk clerk was not welcoming| offered no info re breakfast options or any other hotel services. I had noted this trip was to celebrate my husbands birthday| but this was not even acknowledged in any way.Room was very shabby and in dire need of a refurbishment. Previous breakfast option has been replaced with a greatly inferior offering. Only plus point is the hotel's location. Even so I believe I will go elsewhere on my next visit to NYC,Dec 11| 2019,2
The location is perfect. Lots of nice restaurants nearby.,Dec 6| 2019,5
Check in and out are quick| location is very convenient.,Dec 5| 2019,5
Excellent service| great location| and superb comfort. I had a procedure done at NYU hospital and was so glad to have stayed at this hotel. The staff was so nice and accommodating it made the entire experience that much less stressful for my wife and me. We will definitely choose to stay here again the next time we visit NYC!,Dec 5| 2019,5
Staff were so friendly and couldn’t help you enough especially Alex at reception. Place was really clean,Dec 4| 2019,5
Got charged hidden fees on top of my room price,Dec 4| 2019,1
Service| location| room and view were all great. I would visit here again.,Dec 3| 2019,5
Very old looking bedrooms. Poor interior design. The lobby is very good. Bedroom size and furniture layout feels too small too. But the view is magnificent. I’d prefer a nice chair to enjoy the view. Thanks.,Dec 3| 2019,4
I was able to get an excellent rate at this hotel and had read the reviews which were positive overall.  I was happy to see that the reviews were accurate.  The staff were very friendly and welcoming.  The amenities were nice: fresh water bottles| coffee and tea in the room| wifi.  Parking garages were nearby but the affiliated garage was full.  I found a better garage (M parking) just up the block with a better rate which worked out well.  The room we were given was on the 31st floor and had amazing views.  Just what I had hoped for.  The only downside is that everything is a little worn around the edges and the sound barrier between the elevators and other guest rooms isn't great.  But it was manageable given the positives.,Dec 2| 2019,4
Stayed for 7 nights| had a lovely stay. Really good location. Stayed on floor 23 and had a lovely view on the empire state building Room was slightly small for all my stuff but that is a me problem not a hotel problem! cleaning staff must have been very patient coming in and making our bed every morning. I can't comment on the gym facilities as I didn't use it| I was too busy shopping and eating!,Nov 29| 2019,5
Clean hotel good location decent rooms would stay again,Nov 27| 2019,4
Excellent location. Clean room and kind emoloyees.,Nov 27| 2019,5
This was a very nice hotel in a great location. Across the road from Macy's and right next door to the subway. About a 10 minute walk to time square. Very nice rooms.Great security and very friendly staff.,Nov 26| 2019,5
LOCATIONGREAT PLACENEAR THE SUBWAYGOOD SERVICE,Nov 26| 2019,4
We loved everything about this hotel although the size of the room was ridiculously small. We felt like we were shoehorned into the Hilton's smallest room.,Nov 26| 2019,4
The hotel was comfortable| the beds and shower are amazing| the staff were the best! The down side| the location to the ACE (blue) and 123 (red) Subway is a walk to Times Square| not so convenient| so plan for extra walking time. Another| I DO NOT recommend taking their car shuttle to the airport| even though the desk clerk told me and my husband it is cheaper than a cab (cost $50) it was MORE expensive| $65 a rip off~~did not see that coming!,Nov 26| 2019,5
The convenience shop was consistently closed during our stay. Also street noise was a problem.,Nov 25| 2019,3
Good service| great location| steps away from 34th Street Station. We’ll be back.,Nov 25| 2019,5
Check-in was easy and brief| multiple elevators with quick service| the room was clean and no allergies triggered from our stay. The only odd detail was the fitted sheets were too small for the mattress (but the sheets felt freshly washed). Quick walk to Times Square where we were seeing a show.,Nov 25| 2019,4
I’m unclear as to which hotel the other reviewers stayed in because it can’t have been the one we experienced. Aloof staff on reception| dated and poorly kept decor| damaged dirty rooms and sheets. The real kicker was a real problem with extreme static electricity in the bedding - visible sparks and couldn’t sleep without sharp shocks waking us. In the end we had to strip the bedding ourselves and make do. Fortunately we only had one night and moved to The Langham (which is amazing). This hotel is really really poor value for money.,Nov 25| 2019,2
good location |room is clean| will recommend to my friends,Nov 25| 2019,5
Conveniently located with easy access to several subway lines. It was surprisingly quiet for midtown Manhattan.,Nov 24| 2019,5
Efficient check in and out process. Very friendly front staff in person and on the phone.,Nov 24| 2019,5
Great location you can walk to just about anything! Our room was Clean and had just enough space!,Nov 24| 2019,4
The location is good| right in the middle of Herald Square and near all transportation. It's in an old building| but  thr property its clean.,Nov 24| 2019,5
Everyone was friendly and helpfull.  They were able to get a handicapped taxi or u each time.,Nov 21| 2019,5
Location is amazing!!! Very close to metroRooms are small... especially if you’re taking 2 beds. The 3 elevators can’t cope with the amount of guests especially in the morning. Service is good very attentive,Nov 20| 2019,4
the stay was actually ok. Front desk was super nice. No problems until the morning| when room service decided to OPEN my door at 9am and woke us woke.. The view was nice too,Nov 19| 2019,3
The bed kept making a sound. Even just by sitting on it. The people next door in the adjoining room kept trying to come through the door. And the walls were super thin. We could hear the tv next door.,Nov 19| 2019,2
Great location| right next to subway stop| love that they use fitted sheets.  Uncomfortable bed| noisy room (heard elevator all night had to buy ear plugs)| uncomfortable pillows| key system to activate elevator doesn't work well - very frustrating every elevator trip. Would probably stay here again for the proximity to the subway stop.,Nov 18| 2019,2
The staff was very attentive| the hotel was clean and the area was great!! Will definitely stay there again.,Nov 18| 2019,5
Hotel was great and location was awesome. We love New York!,Nov 18| 2019,5
Decent location. Not as clean as we would’ve liked.,Nov 17| 2019,3
Very pleasant and helpful staff. Room was roomy| clean and good value,Nov 16| 2019,5
Thank you,Nov 16| 2019,5
Very helpful at service desk|room space a little tight. Close to all NYC sights.,Nov 16| 2019,4
Great location and very clean comfortable rooms.  Highly recommend.,Nov 14| 2019,5
I loved the location of this property! I wish I could’ve had a view of Empire State but it was cozy and clean. I left my necklace and they had it waiting for me! Thank you so much!,Nov 13| 2019,5
Clean & comfortable| perfect for a short stay in the Big Apple!,Nov 12| 2019,5
Walls beat up in room near door. Looked scuff marks||||||||||,Nov 11| 2019,4
Nice hotel|  great location|  stayed 2nd time|  friendly staff|  comfortable quiet room.,Nov 5| 2019,5
It was my first stay in new York and this hotel is very basic.i won’t recommend for family at all . May be ok for a business trip.,Nov 5| 2019,3
Stay was amazing!Best location and hotel!,Nov 2| 2019,5
I stayed with my family only to visit NYC and my family loved the conditions and location. Also| people in the hotel was also helpful and welcoming (nice and kind). Thank you,Nov 1| 2019,5
The room was very clean | comfortable beds | quiet place and excellent location !,Oct 30| 2019,4
The location of this hotel is perfect| next to a subway| round the corner from a breakfast bar and a 24 hour food court.  Across the road from a 24 hour Pharmacy| a three minute walk to Herald Square| Macys and other major shops.  The hotel is clean and the staff efficient and friendly.  The standard double room is small| but that is normal for all Hotel rooms in New York so I would not recommend more than two adults share a room. My only true negative is hearing the street noise from 6th Avenue during the night| if you are a light sleeper| the sounds of car horns| sirens and night construction may keep you awake.  We were able to purchase ear plugs from the Pharmacy across the street (I recommend the silicone ones) and that took care of the problem.  I would definately stay at this Hotel again for my next trip to New York.,Oct 29| 2019,5
Neat and clean hotel| good size rooms for New York| nice open views with good light| hotel is showing wear -The carpet in the room needs to be replaced| if there’s new carpet it would’ve been a much nicer stay| I definitely felt there was some smoking going on which is not the hotels fault| I could smell it in the room| overall the interior of the room is just a bit tired| and it’s only a brief stay but the lime green and brown decorum | is a real quandary :-) horrible combination.,Oct 28| 2019,4
Excellent location| extremely friendly staff and super clean room.  Definitely plan to return on our frequent trips to NYC.,Oct 26| 2019,5
Just really nice people. And the rooms were very clean,Oct 25| 2019,5
Very nice place. Friendly. Good area. Easy to walk to everything. Hint...use the parking just before the hotel...much cheaper than the lot the hotel recommends and closer!,Oct 22| 2019,5
Place was great but not having free breakfast was bad.,Oct 22| 2019,4
Had a wonderful time and stayed in a great room with a view of the Empire State building. The hotel is in a great location and the staff was great. We were able to check in a little early which was very nice. Only minor complaint would be that the outside noise did seem to penetrate more that I would of liked| but sirens and horns comes with staying in NYC. Overall| great experience.,Oct 22| 2019,5
Great property| room are a little bit small but overall it's fine. The staff is really good.,Oct 21| 2019,5
The customer service was pleasant. Nothing extra ordinary or friendly. The room needs a lot of improvements though. The room was very dark even with the bathroom light on and door wide open. Carpet is old and some wear are clearly visible near the bathroom and TV area| even in the dark. Bed covers need an update. The bed was uncomfortable but there was a good number of pillows. The headboard wall was an unpleasant dark green wallpaper. The room was clean. The standing lamp needed a new bulb| that was replaced the same day we called. Coffee maker and mini fridge in the room was good. The hotel is conveniently close to the train station and subway. There's a storage room for luggage while you wait for rooms to be ready and a cozy sitting area on the corner. The small bar was open for alcoholic beverages but we skipped that. They have a grab and go breakfast/snack corner if you're in a rush. We didn't purchase anything from there. It's an okay hotel and there are better ones in the same area for close to if not the same price but it was a long weekend so they'll charge according to occupancy demands. We are choosing another hotel brand next time.,Oct 20| 2019,2
Great location safe hotel clean and comfortable for business or vacation,Oct 18| 2019,4
Very clean| courteous and helpful staff| close proximity to everything .Comfortable beds| huge showers all the amenities of home -hair dryer| iron| ironing board| microwave| fridge. Nice clean cafe with breakfast items as well as lunch. If you are a Hilton Honors member it is free otherwise you pay for your food. Convenient for guests. Amazing view of the Empire State Building! Parking garage right down the street.,Oct 16| 2019,5
Nice Stay.  Easy walking distance to MSG| and close to restaurants. We were meeting family and friends for dinner and a concert at MSG.,Oct 15| 2019,5
Check in went very smoothly and attendant was very nice. The room and bathroom were very clean and parking was offsite but very close by. The only small issue we came across was that when we booked it said breakfast but when we went down for breakfast it was only if you are a Hilton member. We ended up paying extra for our breakfast which could have been better| but it wasn’t too bad.,Oct 14| 2019,4
Amazing location with a view of the Empire State Building and at a reasonable rate?  What more could you want?,Oct 14| 2019,5
Whilst this hotel offers a good amount of amenities there are a few improvements which should be considered. We stayed in a twin room which was small (not sure its would comfortably sleep more than two people! Room decor was very dated and would benefit from a make our. Reception staff and room attendants weee very polite which helped with the experience| especially since it’ was my first visit. Location of this hotel is very central| with Times Square| Empire State Building and other tourist attractions within walking distance.,Oct 14| 2019,4
My wife and I booked this hotel last minute for a few days in NYC. I will say that the staff| service| and location were EXCELLENT! I got a text asking about the quality of my room| the front desk was always cheerful and eager to help| and the cleaning staff was prompt and friendly. The BEST thing about this hotel is the location. There aren't any great views on the bottom floors (I can't speak to the top)| but there were so many subway trains that were direct routes back to our hotel. It made getting around the city a breeze!My only complaint is the condition of the rooms. They aren't awful| but there is some definite "wear and tear" that needs to be addressed. Maybe I just got a bad room (708)| but the walls and furniture were very scuffed up and torn. The sheets and beds were very clean| but the surrounding areas needed attention.Once again| if you are looking for a simple hotel with a GREAT location for exploring Manhattan| this is a great pick. If you are looking for luxury and amenities| look elsewhere.,Oct 12| 2019,4
Good location. Price was good  I would stay again.,Oct 10| 2019,4
great value| clean| great location,Oct 9| 2019,5
Good time for check out |the room was clean and good location near to subway.,Oct 8| 2019,5
This hotel was very clean 😊Staff was very friendly and helpful 😊,Oct 7| 2019,4
There is no valet to help with the luggage| the closet space is very small for a double bedroom,Oct 7| 2019,3
This Garden Hilton is comparable to a Holiday Inn Express.Breakfast would have been better at McDonald's around thecorner but less convenient. Its the location of the hotel just a fewblocks from Penn Station that is its great advantage.,Oct 6| 2019,4
Clean| nice| great location..I will go back there again for sure/,Oct 6| 2019,5
I did not like the room they selected upon check in. It was dark and depressing. However| not all rooms were that way. I asked for a change and they were very accommodating at the front  desk. I now had a view of the Empire State Building. Wow!,Oct 4| 2019,4
The location was perfect. Have been to NYC 4 times prior and tbis location was the best. Its close to food and Shopping. Our housekeeper (young Asian lady) was amazing and really sweet. Our room was cleaned to perfection for the 4 days we stayed. AJ at guest services was very nice as well. I will be staying again.,Oct 3| 2019,4
We couldn't have asked for a better stay. Our room was on the top floor of the hotel and had an amazing view of the Empire State building. We were able to store our bags with the hotel after check out and get a few more hours enjoying the city.,Oct 2| 2019,5
Location| right next to a subway entrance. Walking distance to everything.,Oct 2| 2019,4
Location for Times Square could not be more ideal!,Sep 30| 2019,5
Good location| twin room was quite small and cafe/ bar/ restaurant only open in the morning and evening.,Sep 29| 2019,4
The viees were great. The front desk of the morning sfift of the 27th were very court,Sep 28| 2019,4
Excellent location in the heart of Manhattan| and Kim was a very helpful member of staff.,Sep 27| 2019,4
The property was perfect and near all the attractions and stores. The staff was very polite and generous| i love the room I was in with the view of midtown. Everything went perfect!!,Sep 25| 2019,5
Breakfast should have been complimentary.Overall everything was fine.,Sep 24| 2019,5
Very clean room. Staff was very polite. Quick check out,Sep 24| 2019,5
Great experience.  Great view.   Very clean room!  Quick check in| and elevator to 31st floor wa very quick!,Sep 23| 2019,5
Booked from Europe through booking website  could not get on Hilton in 3 tries  Told we therefore could not get Honor points.  Told we got breakfast but it was meager and we had to pay extra because we are not gold members. Room was small but bath smaller than 3rd class on a ship. Never again! In future we will stick to Holiday Inn and free breakfast,Sep 21| 2019,2
Maybe it was just the room I was assigned. I was not impressed at all. It was outdated and had not been maintained. Floor was dirty and stained| shower was not clean| shower curtain wouldn't snap closed all the way so it hung open at the top| caulking in the bathroom was "mildewy" and the room had an odd smell. Woke up to what appeared to be cigarette smell coming through the connecting door. Quickly showered| gathered my things and left for my meeting. Tried to stop at the front desk but line was too long. For the price| wouldn't pick this again.,Sep 19| 2019,3
Great service and central location to everything you need to explore the city!,Sep 19| 2019,5
Great room and location of hotel,Sep 17| 2019,4
Brilliant stay,Sep 16| 2019,4
Room was small but clean.  No complaints. Close by the Empire State and easy to walk to places,Sep 16| 2019,4
Location excellent - close to Macys| Empire State| Times Square and subway.Dated and in need of refurbishment.  Rooms small.Pay no attention to the different room sizes (sq ft) shown on Expedia as we booked a 310 sq ft room with 2 double beds instead of a 260 sq ft.  The room size is not shown on your confirmation and the Hotel insist all their rooms are the same size and didn't know different sizes were shown on Expedia website.  After complaining we were given a room with a different configuration which at least meant we could get around the end of the bed without having to move the chair each time.,Sep 14| 2019,3
I like that my family especially my daughter who was being sworn in that mon. Sep 9th| loved the scenery of the empire state building right behind our room| and what i disliked is when arrived only 1 room was available| therefore we was told it be ready at 3:30 for us to come back| we did to find that it still wasn't ready| and lastly the final morning my mom snd daughter ran out of toilet paper called down stairs to let desk know| an hour went by and still no toilet paper| so my daughter finally called the desk again to cancel because no one responded| and 3min. Later they csme up with toilet paper.,Sep 14| 2019,5
Nice place good price and location| slight walk (1.5  lock) for parking and center of times square. No bible in the room and pillows weren’t very good. Otherwise good to go!,Sep 13| 2019,4
Everything was excellent thanks.,Sep 12| 2019,5

It was very clean| staff very helpful| location the best| hi highly recommend it. Near everything.,Sep 10| 2019,5
Great room for the price.  Conveniently located.  Parking should be less as it's self parking.,Sep 10| 2019,5
Best location| great condition. Everything was good,Sep 10| 2019,5
the bar was closed on sunday because an employee called out...opening day for the nfl and tennis finals and there was no bar...where is the backup plan if an employee doesnt show?....also i was on the 17th floor and there was no hot water in the shower at 10am monday morning,Sep 10| 2019,2
Adequate comfortable room. Service could have been better. There was no bell hops to help with luggage.The elevator security system with keys was demeaning. I’d prefer a better security arrangement.The rooms were clean and adequate the bed was comfortable!,Sep 9| 2019,4
When we arrived the front desk immediately made us feel like home.,Sep 8| 2019,5
Clean and friendly staff. Steps away from the Empire State Building Great walking location to all major streets and subways,Sep 6| 2019,4
I searched and read a lot of reviews before choosing a hotel in NYC where space is limited. Don't expect a typical size room but this room was just fine! Plenty of drawer and closet space. Microwave| fridge| and coffee maker. Comfortable a/c. Elevator didn't have any waiting. Subway close by or a couple blocks away depending which train you need. Right by Herald Square and Macy's| walking distance to Time Square| Uber was very accessible. We were in town for the U.S. Open so we didn't spend much time in the hotel| but it was nice to have plenty of space to unpack our things for the week.,Sep 6| 2019,4
Overall it was good... it would’ve been better if parking was included... had to park mikes away and walk to get to the room,Sep 3| 2019,4
Loved the location| room size| cleanliness and just overall very nice hotel!,Sep 3| 2019,5
Excellent stay: superb customer| awesome room condition and location,Sep 3| 2019,5
The location is the best advantage| it is convenient to almost everything you can do in the city.,Sep 3| 2019,3
The staff was super accommodating and friendly. I liked that you needed a room key to be able to use the elevator to go up to each floor and to enter the hotel after hours.,Sep 3| 2019,5
Room was clean and had an amazing view. Janis from the front desk was amazing.,Sep 3| 2019,5
Great location| they allowed us to pre-check and they have a storage space for your luggage.  We used it since we arrived prior to check in and left our room before our departure time.,Sep 3| 2019,5
Good value for location and service. Walking distance to many NYC landmarks,Sep 2| 2019,5
Great location Cookie cutter roomStaff was very nice,Sep 2| 2019,4

Great central hotel| just minutes from the Empire State| great shopping and Times Square. We enjoyed our stay and the room was quite nice with a lovely view of the Empire State| staff were friendly and we loved being able to walk everywhere.,Aug 30| 2019,5
The room we got is outdated and definitely smaller than the other rooms on the same floor.We tried to borrow an umbrella from the front desk|  but they told us we have to buy one from their store. I don’t understand why they don’t offer simple service like that.,Aug 29| 2019,1
Good location for getting around New York nice view of Empire State from our room,Aug 27| 2019,4
Excellent service| clean room| great location and very efficient and friendly front desk staff. Very enjoyable stay!!,Aug 27| 2019,5
I really enjoyed my stay at the Hilton Garden Inn! The staff was super friendly and the location was amazing! It was centrally located and in walking distance to shopping| Times Square| and Bryant Park!  The view of the Empire State Building from my hotel window at night was simply delightful.,Aug 27| 2019,5
The location was perfect for sight seeing. The staff were friendly and helpful. The building did not feel old and dirty.,Aug 27| 2019,5
This Hilton was an amazing value. Great location with a subway stop steps outside the door and a few blocks to penn station. Front desk staff was some of the beat I have ever had. They were so nice and friendly| they gave us bottled water at check in and gave my girls granola bars. Room was clean and good size for NYC. We could see the Empire State Building from our window. Will define use this hotel again!,Aug 27| 2019,5
The property is situated in a good location.  Close to major shopping venues.  I did not like that check-in was delayed because rooms were not ready.  I did not like that the bar area was closed and the rooms were very small.,Aug 26| 2019,3
It is quite and safe| but when it comes to cleanses needs improvement,Aug 26| 2019,3
Great view of the city! Nice and clean!,Aug 25| 2019,5
The hotel located in a very filthy street (as almost all NYC streets). One of the receptionists were rude and dealt in a very unprofessional way till another staff member came in and helped in the check-in. The room was smaller than expected| with a view on buildings roof top (not to the city view as they mentioned when I booked). All photos about the entrance and rooms of the hotel doesn't related to the actual reality. I would give it minus (-3 stars) even compared to hotels in Lebanon! Parking: The staff advised to deal with parking called ICON to get discount. It was higher than the one next to the hotel with $15 ! Don't park your car in that ICON one.,Aug 25| 2019,1
Is ok for new new York closed to everthing ok next time w know thank you,Aug 24| 2019,3
Great location! Clean hotel| will definitely stay here again!,Aug 23| 2019,5
Fantastic service from staff; room was exceptionally clean with great amenities like fridge and microwave. Good location and safe,Aug 22| 2019,5
Location is great| room ok| but needed an update. Long waiting time for elevators! Don’t book/pay city view- our room was considered city view| but not much city to be seen at all.,Aug 21| 2019,4
I was there for only 9 hours mist of that was sleeping BUT front desk very accommodating. A women.... missed her name...when she heard driver| car| 5:00 AM. She was ON IT...,Aug 20| 2019,4

Great Location. Check in was easy.,Aug 20| 2019,5
The hotel was in an amazing location. We had a fourth floor double room that had a view of a brick wall and two yucky windows. Hey it’s New York! The room was small but workable fir three of us. The bathroom was pretty small but for one night ok. I think if we had been there a week would have been an issue. The wall in the room was pretty scuffed up so would do with some TLC.,Aug 20| 2019,4
Over all the hotel was good. Hotel has a connection with one of the parking lots and I parked there for 48 hrs. I found out that they stole my things from the car.,Aug 19| 2019,3
Room wasn't ready when we checked in.Location is great for a concert.,Aug 19| 2019,4
It’s not good. Especially the shower water coming outside the tube and spill all over the floor in the restroom.,Aug 19| 2019,1
Amazing hotel in the middle of it all! Minutes to Times Square| Minutes to Koreatown (amazing Curry and Korean Fried Chicken)| and a subway entrance 1 building (not block) over.,Aug 18| 2019,5
The property was nice and clean however; the room was somewhat beat up. Tears in the wallpaper| the bathroom fixtures were pretty much falling apart which I suppose would be customary for as much use as it experiences. Worst thing about the room was no fan in the bathroom. Basically you take a shower then wait 10 minutes before you can do anything. The best thing was really the staff. The folks at the front desk and especially the guy who was the bartender. Extremely nice and helpful.,Aug 17| 2019,4
Close to shopping| subway| Empire State Building and Times Square ! Great location and polite staff ! Would definitely recommend !,Aug 15| 2019,5

Staffs were friendly and were we offered water on arrival.,Aug 6| 2019,4
Perfect location! If I was being overly critical I’d say the pillows were terrible.Walking distance and/or basically 3 stops from anywhere you’d wanna go. Clean & beyond great for the price point.,Aug 6| 2019,5
Excellent customer service and help,Aug 5| 2019,5
My stay at this hotel was AMAZING!! Would definitely recommend and I will be visiting again.,Aug 5| 2019,5
Sitting outside on patio was asked to move unless buying drinks from bar after 5 pm. Actually saw people coming off the street and using the chairs while we were there. Always seems to be something to annoy you while trying to enjoy yourself.,Aug 5| 2019,5

Close to everything... Easy to get around... Choices abound...,Jul 30| 2019,4
The room was small| too small for a sofa| overlooking an office building| but the room was very quiet| the king bed was extremely comfortable| the amenities include a full refrigerator| and the bath and room were clean and updated. The location is great. We twice went to the popular Izakaya MEW restaurant next door down some stairs for Japanese food . We would stay again.,Jul 28| 2019,5

Location| and cleanliness were excellent.I wish they had sauna and steambath.,Jul 22| 2019,5
Lobby staff very friendly and helpful.  Parking close but quite expensive at $57 a night and no in/out privileges. Close to subway.  Room next to elevator but never heard it.  People in next room were a bit loud at times and the sound carried.  Cleaning staff did an good job except for leaving their empty Cheetos bag in the bathroom one day and a sink full of water the next.,Jul 22| 2019,4
I had a great stay at the Hilton Garden Inn!  I was in NYC for work.  Janice at the front desk was great as was Sean the bartender.  The room was clean and more spacious then many hotels I have stayed at in NYC.  The shower was great| good pressure and hot.  It was in a great location near my office (Empire State.)  I would recommend.,Jul 19| 2019,5
We felt spoiled staying at this hotel at such a reasonable rate for the location. We checked in late at night and were greeted by very friendly staff who checked us in quickly. The view from our room was great| with the Empire State Building right outside our window. Our room was clean and quiet. The noon checkout time was also perfect since we had a late arrival; we got the rest we needed to enjoy the day. Thanks so much!,Jul 18| 2019,5
The hotel was very clean and comfortable. We were there for the Jennifer Lopez concert so this hotel was close and convenient!!Thank you ;)Jenn,Jul 18| 2019,5

The room was smaller than I expected| but this hotel is at a great location. In walking distance of a lot of great stuff.,Jul 15| 2019,5
The check in process. The staff accused me of only booking for 2 people when clearly on the confirmation it was four people. They were trying to get out of giving us two double beds.,Jul 15| 2019,2
Very friendly and very clean quiet inside the hotel,Jul 15| 2019,5
Location is great. The facility is a bit dated. The shower was awesome for a hotel!,Jul 14| 2019,4
All good but bed bug bites. We left with full of bed bug bites. On my right arm| I had 25 bites. For my wife| double that number...,Jul 12| 2019,3
Great placement| close to main attractions and good food,Jul 9| 2019,5
Stayed here for a night while on a work trip. Room was clean and large. Bed was comfy. Staff was pleasant upon check-in. Hotel is located right next to all major subway lines. There are a lot of restaurants in the area. I enjoyed my short stay.,Jul 8| 2019,5
The Garden Inn Hotel is wonderful Friendly staff| good sized bedrooms and really comfy beds. We were on the 24th floor and it was very quiet at night. It is only about 10 minutes walk away from Times Square and the subway station is just steps away from the front doors. Perfect.,Jul 7| 2019,5
Staffs were really friendly. It was easy to check-in and check out. The bedsheets had a few stains here and there. The hairdryer worked but felt kind of gross because it was old and the silicone areas felt sticky.,Jul 6| 2019,3
It was worth the money spent and in walking distance to time square. The staff was extremely friendly.  Great experience. Would definitely come back and stay again.,Jul 6| 2019,4
Small but nice and clean| needs some updating. Was a nice getaway,Jul 5| 2019,4

The ENTIRE staff was extremely friendly and professional. Front desk| housekeeping| bag check. The bed was very comfortable and that's a godsend considering I don't sleep well in hotel beds. Great location from the main bus stop. Overall excellent value. Will book again in the future.,Jun 28| 2019,5
Great location with very fast check in so could go straight to our room to rest,Jun 27| 2019,5
New York hotels are expensive and don’t live up to the accommodation prices.  The air con was loud| bed comfortable| room was dated.,Jun 26| 2019,3
The staff was very friendly and helpful. Gave great advice on traveling around the city and to the airport.,Jun 25| 2019,5

Very professional and helpful staff. Easy check in and out and ready with suggestions for local places,Jun 24| 2019,5
There was some difficulties with checking in because I booked with Expedia but I’m glad everything got resolved.,Jun 23| 2019,4
My daughter and I greatly enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Garden Inn.  The room was immaculate; the bed was comfortable; the bathroom had a great power shower; the soundproofing was excellent; there were plenty of channels on the TV; the WiFi was optimal: there was a microwave and a mini fridge.  The staff were extremely helpful; the hotel is less than a block from public transit.  Would I stay there again!  Oh| yes| with pleasure!!,Jun 19| 2019,5
The hotel was perfect in every way. The staff was great and took care of everything we needed.,Jun 18| 2019,5

Great staff who helped both on Reception and guides fir the area. Extremely good location,Jun 17| 2019,4
Nice hotel. Great area. Very close to Subway and Path Train stations. Walking distance to Times Square| Empire State Building| etc. Room was clean. AC worked wonderfully. Refrigerator and microwave in room! Great customer service. Only issue (and it’s not exclusive to this hotel) is that check-in time is very late. Thanks!!,Jun 16| 2019,4
Very clean| spacious| friendly staff. Subway on corner| close to Penn Station| Macy's| Empire State Building! Will definitely stay there again!,Jun 16| 2019,5
Good room for the money. Very spacious. Will stay again.,Jun 15| 2019,4
The accomadations for this hotel was excellent in our experiance. We could see the Empire State Building from our room and was only a block and a half away. Walking distance to Time Square and Madison Square Gardens made it an ideal place to stay and making it a great central location to where all the action is. The staff was really friendly and helpful. Would definately consider staying again when we go back to NYC.,Jun 15| 2019,5
This hotel is close to Penn Station giving me easy access to Long Island to visit family. The room was very clean with amenities such as in-room coffee maker| mini fridge and microwave. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. Great breakfast area on the first floor. Have already booked a future stay there again ;),Jun 13| 2019,5
nice very clean  staff are very friendly  hotel is very nice condition  very nice location safe.,Jun 13| 2019,5
Accommodated is on short notice. Very conveniently located to subway and nearby attractions. Discounted parking on next block. Very helpful and knew their city well. Would definitely stay again!,Jun 13| 2019,5
We found the property to be in excellent condition with a great staff.  The lounge was comfortable with a good selection of drinks and food.  The only area which should be considered for improvement is breakfast.  The majority of Hilton Garden Inns we have stayed at had a nice breakfast buffet with options for omelets.  This one had a very meager selection.  You can do better!,Jun 13| 2019,5
Great view.  Good service. Very professional.,Jun 12| 2019,5
Easy check in. Amazing location not far from where the mega bus dropped me off at. I would definitely stay here again.,Jun 12| 2019,5
Clean and comfortable. Steps from a subway stop and easy access to Penn Station. Nothing fancy| but a good price for the location.,Jun 10| 2019,4
Hotel was good once you get in. I had a late arrival at 11:30pm. Street outside was full of people lined up for the club in the hotel next door. Not a problem for me but some people may become stressed.,Jun 10| 2019,4
I asked the gentleman who checked us in if we could switch to the Hilton Garden Inn on 33rd street| as I booked that hotel in error| and he said no. When I went to the Hilton on 33rd street and talked to the manager there| she said that he should have let us switch since it was the same hotel.  Our bedding was horrible| not big enough to fit the bed so my husband and I were constantly fighting for the sheets.  And the bathroom was old and outdated.,Jun 10| 2019,1
Area around hotel is filthy.  Bed was like cement.  They said they sent check out receipts still have not seen it ( e mail),Jun 8| 2019,4
Room had a musty smell and the elevators broke on our last day,Jun 6| 2019,4
The room was a tad small but for the price and convenience I couldn't have been more pleased. The bathtub was huge and just what I needed to take a salt bath after working all day and driving hours to get to the city. Parking| though not valet| was around the corner and they gave me the standard car rate of $57 for a medium sized SUV Toyota Highlander for 24 hours-a deal by any standard in NYC! All in all a pleasurable experience.,Jun 6| 2019,5
Conveniently located.,Jun 6| 2019,4
The hotel was in a great location and all of the staff there were fantastic and were so friendly and helpful.,Jun 5| 2019,5

Very convenient Location and friendly and helpful stuff.,Jun 1| 2019,5
Check in was perfect! The front desk staff was so friendly and welcoming. This is the second time at this location and it’s by far the best hotel in Manhattan for value and location.,May 28| 2019,5
The rooms are a little small but very nice location!,May 28| 2019,4
Great location! Everyone that works there was really nice and accommodating!,May 27| 2019,5
The hotel as well as the room was clean. Even the room was smaller (typical for NYC) it didn’t feel cramped. Staff was extremely nice and helpful!,May 26| 2019,5
The room was clean but could use a little refresh. The staff at the front desk were very helpful and kind. I needed to stay near Penn Station| so this worked well for me location wise (although Midtown is not my favorite area in the city!). I stayed for two nights and spent most of my time outside of the hotel.,May 22| 2019,4
Enjoy are stay everyone was f friendly different recommend this place location was great had a little issue with key but it got taken care of will definitely stay here again really enjoyed it first time staying at this hotel it was really nice,May 21| 2019,5

Great location| pleasant and courteous staff| clean and spacious room.,May 13| 2019,4
Great location for visiting the garment district and other attractions.,May 12| 2019,5
Location good|limited facilities and our room was quite small and dated.,May 9| 2019,4
Great place great location. It's just next to the subway entrance Korean street. I enjoy the food there.,May 9| 2019,5
This hotel is close to Herald Square and Macys etc. it’s right around the corner . Also only a few blocks to Times Square without all the madness . My room had a brilliant view of the Empire State Building. Lots of shops| delis||restaurants of all flavors. On top of the convenience to the subways | the price was outstanding,May 8| 2019,4
Loved the location 10 min cab to every attraction. The staff were incredible. The service was unbelievable. I was provided food options that were amazing. The hotel lobby is small with no restaurant and room was small but its NYC its understandable. Excellent value! Best deal. Definitely would stay here again!,May 7| 2019,5
The hotel was very nice. The staff were extremely friendly. The only downside is that the rooms are very small (it is New York|though).,May 7| 2019,5
Room was a bit smaller than expected.,May 6| 2019,4
Room smelled like mold. No additional towels were provided as requested. A note about breakfast was on our key. But then advised we were not on a list for breakfast. Why even mention it.,May 6| 2019,1
I spent the weekend at the Hilton Garden with my husband and 8 year old. It was a really nice stay| reasonably sized room| pleasant staff and very close to everything we wanted to do. We would stay again.,May 6| 2019,4
Staff was friendly. Location was great. Water pressure in shower was awesome.,May 5| 2019,5
Amazing views of Empire State Building and convienienrly locates to subway and shopping.,May 5| 2019,5
The room had a view of the Empire State Building and amenities were good. However| the top of the chairs and around the desk was quite dusty so standards of cleanliness could have been better. Also| a lot of street noise came through the windows at night. to the extent that I had to buy ear-plugs from a nearby pharmacy to get a decent night's sleep. nevertheless| I was happy with my choice of Hilton Garden Inn West 35th street and would stay there again.,Apr 30| 2019,4
I loved that we were able to leave our bags there until our room was ready for free.,Apr 29| 2019,5
Received wrong room| payed extra for specifics and did not receive even close.,Apr 28| 2019,2
Walking distance from Penn Station. Several restaurants within walking distance and close to public transit stops.,Apr 28| 2019,4
Parking service provided by hotel was not that reasonable.,Apr 26| 2019,4
Good no frills hotel.  Right on the edge of Ktown so lots of good Asian food| but not more than a 10 minute walk to Times Square| Penn Station| or Grand Central Station.,Apr 25| 2019,4
I liked the location of this hotel. It was a small room (as expected in Manhattan)| but is clean and includes all the amenities I needed. The staff is excellent and very helpful. Will stay again.,Apr 25| 2019,5
Our stay was amazing but we had an inconvenience with the front desk personnel we parked our vehicle on the garage and the garage personal told us that our hotel was going to give us a discount and their rate was 69 with taxes but the front desk charged us 119 very disappointed of the customer service they delivered even though they laugh at us.,Apr 23| 2019,3
No public bathroom in the lobby was very inconvenient. The a la carte breakfast was very good| many choices for full breakfast.Lobby is too small| cramped| inconveniently set up for large amount of clientele. It is squeezed into Manhattan like most newer hotels! We had to change our reservation from 3 nights to one night and either Expedia screwed up the room change or had no choice with Hilton| and just didn't tell us. My wife doesn't want to use Expedia ever again.,Apr 23| 2019,2
Absolutely impressed with our stay here; great location/access to subways| super friendly staff| clean/modern room| and wait for elevators was not long either. Will definitely be back!,Apr 23| 2019,5
The stay was decent. There was confusion beginning with the site. It it had me double booked for the same dates| so wind up paying and extra $297| for a room that I did not book. Manager said it was too late to cancel and charged me. When I had a co worker who needed a room| I was told room was not available for stay b/c they resold the room after I paid for it. Manager (not helpful again) Refuse to offer any resolution. In addition| was told they would not honor my Hilton rewards| because I booked through Hotels.com and not them. Never experienced that before either| I travel weekly and always use a 3rd party site to book and never have this problem. They will never have to worry about me staying with them again. So disappointed in the handling of the situations.,Apr 22| 2019,2
Great location| 200 metres to the metro. Easy access to all the sights. Room was dated but much larger than I expected. It had a small fridge and a microwave. I found it odd that there was no crockery or cutlery for use in microwave| not even a cup or mug. I asked for a cup at reception| but they could only give me some cardboard ones!,Apr 22| 2019,4
Location was great. Near shopping restaurants and Amtrak,Apr 21| 2019,5
Hotel and staff were really great. They held our bags before and after checking in. The hotel was quiet and the beds were comfortable. Location close to lots of things. The only thing I didn’t like was the $50 fee that the hotel charged above the price that I booked on Hotels.com,Apr 21| 2019,4
They took multiple amounts of money from my card after playing up front for my stay was assured I'd be refunded home now 3 wks and still have not received my refund. I have sent email after email and ha emt heard a thing back.,Apr 21| 2019,2
Great location and courteous staff. Spacious room by nyc standards.,Apr 20| 2019,5
This is a good choice if you’re looking for basic economy| cleanliness| and location.  We stayed in NYC for 4 nights and this hotel was exactly what we needed.  Beds were comfortable| room was clean| location is good.  Quick walk to the subway just around the corner for good access to the city.  Room was a bit larger than others we’ve stayed in at NYC.  A little noisy outside the window but nothing out of the norm.  Would recommend as a good economy value.,Apr 20| 2019,4
Great view and location.  More spacious room than average bay hotel.,Apr 19| 2019,4
Perfectly located all major attractions in walking distance,Apr 18| 2019,5
hotel room fairly quiet.  very clean.  close to herald square subway station.  very good bagel shop further west on 35th(best bagel and coffee).,Apr 17| 2019,5
It was very nice,Apr 16| 2019,5
Love my stay here at the HGI.,Apr 16| 2019,5
I liked its furniture and all the staff| it was a pretty good location.,Apr 12| 2019,5
Great customer service.  Location is right by the 34th Herald Station.  Very convenient.,Apr 11| 2019,5
The Hilton Garden Inn on 35th is in a perfect location.  Located in the heart of Korea Town with easy access to public transportation.  The surrounding area is home to fantastic dining and shopping.  The weather was beautiful during our stay so we opted to walk instead of using the subway.  Just around the corner from the Empire State Building.  A short stroll to Bryant Park and a branch of the New York Public Library as well as Times Square.  We will be back next year!,Apr 10| 2019,5
Great location. Very clean. Friendly staff. Amenities could've been slightly better| but overall| no complaints. Would definitely stay here again!,Apr 10| 2019,5
Great hotel| comfy| clean| and in an excellent location. Only thing missing is room service.,Apr 10| 2019,4
Staff woke me up informing that it was time for me to check-out| when in fact I had an additional day. Management continuously worried me about guest coming to the hotel and referred to policy; but couldn’t provide the policy in writing. Total a waste of money.. avoid!!,Apr 9| 2019,2
I am elderly and unfortunately had booked one night later than should have.  The staff was unwilling to help me out.  They didn't have any vacancy they said for the night I needed and said I could not get any refund so I was unable to stay there and lost all of my money,Apr 8| 2019,1
The hotel was nice and a good location.  Nothing extraordinary - but a perfect spot for us to stay.  The thing that was most noteable was how  friendly and helpful the staff was - everyone was great.,Apr 8| 2019,3
This is my fourth time staying at this hotel. The room was recently renovated with no bathtub. The size is quite nice comparing to Manhattan standard. They don’t give you two complimentary bottles of water. You have to ask from the reception. I thought it was free until one agent told me that it was not free. I was quite confused about free water policy. Breakfast was changed from full hot breakfast to premade sandwich. It was horrible breakfast as Garden Inn brand is well known for hot breakfast.,Apr 8| 2019,4
Great location| close to subway and train station. Close to shopping (Macy’s!)Room was moderately sized. Clean.Good| generic hotel in excellent location.Missed the breakfast restaurant that was there last time I stayed there.,Apr 5| 2019,4
When checking in| my two reservations were not listed in the hotel’s database. They had to call Expedia to confirm the reservation existed| and was a huge waste of precious time while on a tight schedule.,Apr 5| 2019,2
They would not give us Hilton Honor points for the stay - bummer.,Apr 2| 2019,4
Great view of the city of New York| but a small room.,Apr 1| 2019,5
We enjoyed this garden inn. It was conveniently located near Penn Station and we were able to walk all of Manhattan. They are able to hold your luggage for you before and after your stay which is very nice in the city. We did not eat or go to the bar but it was nice that it was available. We had a beautiful view of the Empire State Building.,Apr 1| 2019,5
Convenient|  great customer service. nice breakfast .,Mar 31| 2019,4
Excellent  stay at this hotel. Everything was fantastic,Mar 31| 2019,5
Hotel was nice only issue was housekeeping did not leave any towels in the bathroom!,Mar 27| 2019,4
The service was exceptional and the location perfect,Mar 27| 2019,5
Excellent location steps from the subway and Herald Square. The staff were all super friendly and helpful.,Mar 23| 2019,5
It was very close to our venue|  The staff were excellent and accommodating,Mar 23| 2019,5
A nice place to stay| good location and friendly staff!,Mar 23| 2019,4
I loved location I didn’t like size of room or decor,Mar 21| 2019,4
The location is superb| walking distance to Macy's and the subway and in the middle of bustling Midtown. The room was extremely quiet even though I was right in front of the lift| and I could barely hear any street noise. The staff were really helpful and friendly. Rooms were fairly large (by NYC standards)| clean and sufficiently equipped. I would definitely consider staying here again.,Mar 21| 2019,5
Interesting definition of “room with a view”; being so close to Empire State I thought that’s the view I’d get| not of a road junction and a few uptown buildings,Mar 20| 2019,4
Great MidTown location and right next door to the subway station.  This hotel was perfectly located for us to enjoy Central Park| Times Square| The Empire State Buiding and get down to Prospect Park for the half marathon start with ease.,Mar 19| 2019,5
Definitely nothing to exactly wow at. The room was extremely small but that’s really my only negative observation.,Mar 19| 2019,3
We frequently come to NYC and liked many midtown hotels. For this hotel we only Like one thing location.  Dislike many things: front desk lady| no complimentary breakfast| no coffee| no fountain water| no fruits| no pleased deco| no good price| no friendly offer an extended checkout hour. Will never book this one again.,Mar 18| 2019,2
Excellent location| very good reception| room was comfortable.  Only issue was hearing the street noise from the 2nd floor. It was no big deal| I slept fine.  The bedding and pillows were very comfy.2nd stay here| I will definitely be back!,Mar 17| 2019,5
Conveniently located near Penn Station - hotel was very busy with some kind of teen tour but one expects these things in NYC. Overall a nice and reasonably quiet place to stay.,Mar 17| 2019,4
The location was fantastic and the staff were helpful and polite. We had a great city view from our room.,Mar 16| 2019,4
Love it close to everything even to Penn Station which took me to Boston. Will be back someday.,Mar 14| 2019,5
Convenient location| cost-efficient and clean. AC in my room was quite noisy and tended to turn on in the middle of the night| otherwise no complaints.,Mar 13| 2019,4
Furniture will require update as it showed aging| AC/Heating is a little too loud every time it engaged.,Mar 8| 2019,4
First| the location is perfect.  For our business purposes| as well as for a leisure traveler| this-The staff were of the most professional that we've met on our many trips. The free wifi option was faster than many others we've used.  Tamika at checkout| and Kim Reyes at check-in both had amazing customer service| a positive attitude| and were very professional and friendly.  Kim| was probably the friendliest hotel staff person we've encountered on our 100 or so business trips to New York.,Mar 5| 2019,5
Great stay. Location was convenient to many sights in the city,Mar 4| 2019,4
My stay was great even though it was just a short time. Lovely hotel!,Mar 3| 2019,5
Everything was great. If there are toothbrushes| it would be better.,Mar 3| 2019,5
Property was a nice location but not many facilities and room small with leaking shower.,Mar 3| 2019,3
It’s was a beautiful hotel with a very nice view and amazing service,Mar 2| 2019,5
Great location| super views and super staff. Easy check in| clean and updated rooms.,Mar 2| 2019,5
My stay was perfect. I was able to check in an hour early for my room. The hotel was very clean. The only thing is the water in the shower seeped through the door onto the bathroom floor. Thankfully a floor towel was provided to soak the water up. Other than that my stay was perfect and I would definitely stay here again!,Mar 2| 2019,5
Highly recommend the Hilton Garden Inn for its fantastic location and comfort! We had a small but functional (and importantly quiet!) room where all amenities worked well and the mattress was firm and gave us a comfortable night's rest. Prompt and friendly check-in and check-out service. The only negative comment is that there was a strong cologne / perfume smell in our room| which I disliked. Would be wonderful if the hotel could consider providing porcelain plates and cutlery to make the microwave more usable!,Feb 26| 2019,5
Location great| close to shops restaurants subway.,Feb 26| 2019,4
Love the bag check in when the rooms aren't ready "early".,Feb 24| 2019,5
Excellent location and a majority of the staff were very friendly| Jay was great. Expedia messes things up a little as when I cancelled my Hotels.com booking it cancelled Expedia but the hotel managed to find us a room. The rooms are a little dated but for a NYC hotel it was excellent value for money. Having a microwave| fridge and coffee machine in the room was bonus. Would definitely book this hotel again.,Feb 24| 2019,4
It was clean| the staff was great| the rooms were a decent size. It was just a bit of an older building.,Feb 24| 2019,5
Great location. Comfortable clean room.Handy microwave| fridge and coffee machine the room. Room safe included in the price. Free WiFi was a bit hit and miss but can be upgraded if required. Macys| Broadway| Time Square| Theatres| Empire State Building| Madison Square Garden and Penn Station all within a few blocks.Subway station directly outside the hotel. Will stay again on my next visit.,Feb 22| 2019,5
I liked the warmth of the staff. I didn’t like the light weight comforters and the pillows could have been firmer.,Feb 20| 2019,5
The staff was lovely and extremely helpful. If you’re just going to sleep in the room or dump your bags and go| it’s perfect. For me| the room was small and dated. I’m also not a fan of midtown so unfortunately I wouldn’t stay here again. If it only depended on the staff| I would give 5 stars and definitely stay again but like I said| midtown isn’t my favourite and the rooms were not great for a family of 4.,Feb 19| 2019,4
Loved everything about this hotel. Location is fab and we got a room overlooking the ESB. Didnt like the hard sell on the way out tge front door after checking out| where a sales person tries to get you to commit to giving $299 each for another Hilton stay/vacation.,Feb 18| 2019,5
Excellent except car parking. Hotel charges to validate overnight parking,Feb 18| 2019,5
Nice location| spacious rooms| great staff| very cleanParking is $47 a night; Kinda pricey,Feb 18| 2019,5
I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel. Clean| comfy| quiet room and friendly staff. I even had a view of the empire state building from my room! The location was very convenient - subway right on the corner. Would recommend.,Feb 15| 2019,4
Close to our MSG event.,Feb 14| 2019,4
The location of this hotel cannot be beat| right next to a subway station| and about a 5 minute walk from Penn Station. Pricing was reasonable. Service was good. The rooms themselves were clean and the pillows weren't the most comfortable. My only real complaint was that the room had some definite heat retention issues and the temperature was incredibly irregular. It took the heater quite a while to actually respond to the colder temperature in the room| and once triggered| the sound from the heater is overwhelming and impossible to ignore. So while I would recommend this hotel| I would also strongly suggest bringing some layers for your time in the room to compensate for the temperature issues.,Feb 12| 2019,4
Perfect location| friendly staffs| spacious room and comfy beds. Nothing to complain. I will probably come back here whenever I visit NY.,Feb 11| 2019,5
Requested early check in/out and adjoining rooms when trip booked and also followed up with hotel to ensure. Upon check in| no early check in permitted and our two rooms were on different floors. Very disappointed as we had one child and senior and had to rearrange our sleeping arrangements,Feb 11| 2019,3
Good but crowded Elevator mostly busy,Feb 4| 2019,4
Nice location.Clean and comfortable rooms.,Feb 4| 2019,4
Great hotel. Very central. Relaxed atmosphere and helpful staff.,Feb 4| 2019,5
Great locations.Friendly front desk. I booked a non empire view room and it was still great view of city. Only 2 complaints and both not so important (maybe)| 1. left over food spoiled b/c refrigerator was not on| I guess I should have checked| but I'll never make that mistake again| and 2. the closes was tiny| def wouldn't have allowed me to hang anything floor length. Def would stay again.,Jan 28| 2019,4
Loved the location. Very friendly,Jan 23| 2019,5
The location was terrific| staff were very helpful and the hotel was clean. The maintenance team had to come and swap out a thermostat in the room as the temperature could get too high at night despite a reading of 65 degrees. They were prompt but I am not sure that the original problem was fully solved. We had brunch in the restaurant one morning and it was a bit disappointing for the cost. The chef at the omelette station was good but the coffee that was served was not hot and fresh fruit was not all that fresh. It was a nice meal just a bit overpriced in my estimation. I would return to this hotel and would recommend it to others providing the per-night cost is competitive.,Jan 16| 2019,4
Convenient Location for business and leisure. Empire State building close proximity too.,Jan 15| 2019,4
It was all cleanly and good for the price. Not a large room| hotel is a bit old| but all we needed was a bed and a shower and this was a great price point. Location is fantastic. Customer service was somewhat awful - no one was particularly friendly| all seemed bored and fed up.,Jan 14| 2019,4
Small but sufficient room| had everything we needed for a week's stay as a couple. The location can't be beat| you are on Macy's doorstep with major subway routes| tourist attractions| restaurants and bars only a few minutes' walk away. This makes the location a little noisy 24/7 from the streets below| but to be expected when you're in such a prime location. Shower was a little slow to drain after each use| but otherwise amenities were modern and reliable. The room we stayed in did not have a main light on the ceiling| so we were often turning on every lamp/light source in the room to illuminate the space properly.,Jan 14| 2019,4
Great location| very easy to get to subway and walk to Broadway shows and Empire state. Great value room| however mattress was clearly a bit old as it sagged where others had slept,Jan 13| 2019,4
Great for catching shows at the Garden.,Jan 12| 2019,4
The hotel is in tbe perfect location to explore New York.  It is a block away from the Empire State Building and in walking distance to Times Square| Macy's| the Flatiron Building etc.  Woukd highly recommend the hotel for its cost| facilities| staff| food and cleanliness.  Would 100% stay here again.,Jan 11| 2019,5
Great location. Clean and comfortable. Female receptionists are personable and nice. Male....not so much. We were told at the check in that we can request bottled water from the reception desk daily as it was not provided in the room| and it seemed to be that way until one day we met with a male receptionist who told us to pay for it in a tone as if we were caught stealing it. They should have made the message clear one way or the other as I for one wouldn't mind buying my own drinking water. But when you make the guests thinking it is within their rights| don't scold them for it.,Jan 11| 2019,4
Very good location| handy for Uptwon| Downtown and Penn St Station (if you're coming in from JFK on the Sky Train/LIRR). The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. If I return to NY I would certainly stay here again| I can't recommend it highly enough.,Jan 10| 2019,5
Super close to metro stationNoise from air conditioner is loud,Jan 10| 2019,4
Excellent value for money.Exactly what you need in NY with a perfect location right on Herald Square subway station.,Jan 8| 2019,5
We loved the location of this hotel! The room was comfortable as well. The staff was so helpful and nice!,Jan 7| 2019,4
Great Staff| Hotel| and amenities!!! Super location!!!,Jan 6| 2019,5
Great location. Friendly staff. Great stay,Jan 4| 2019,5
Location is great and property was clean but dated especially for the price.  Room was on the 31st floor and could hear the elevator going up and down all day and all night.  No room service available. No parking by hotel| only contracted parking.  Neither the Hilton front desk nor the contracted parking garge informed me that once your car is parked| and you leave| you must pay the max FULL day rate.  This cost me an extra $50 just to check in and off load the bags.  After some descusion the front desk agreed to take care of the parking fee due to the misunderstanding.  When the front desk asked how my stay was I said I couldnt sleep because of the elevator noise they just shrugged and asked how the rest of the stary was.  When I reviewed the invoice I saw the parking charge that was supposed to be removed.  I requested the adjustment for checkin parking be honored| they refused.  Will not be staying here again.,Jan 2| 2019,2
This hotel is convenient to Penn Station and Herald Square,Jan 2| 2019,5
The room and bath were a good size and clean. Laundry service was perfect. location of the hotel is great| close to many things.I would prefer firmer pillows| not the kind you sink in.,Jan 2| 2019,5
Not near to nothing!! Long distance| it said breakfast included and I never be able to catch it!! Over all not my favorite this choice,Jan 1| 2019,3
Poor customer service. No valet service or any type of usual hotel services. Ok Good location but I was very disappointed.,Jan 1| 2019,3
Treated us poorly cuz we booked through Expedia. Got a bad room.,Dec 31| 2018,2
In town for an event at MSG. great location| good up-to-date facilities| welcoming staff,Dec 30| 2018,5
Location was perfect! Close to everything. Check in was annoying. No parking facilities. I had to go to 3 different garages to find parking. I could not leave the car unattended for a second| so I could not unload the suitcases without someone watching them. Nowhere to keep luggage while you parked although the concierge was kind enough to watch them for me for a few minutes. My reservation said “breakfast included” and it was not. Room was tiny. On a positive| it was a quiet| clean room with a baby crib I requested and a bar in the lobby with everything you could need 1 block away.,Dec 28| 2018,3
The rooms are a little small but that is what you expect in NYC| but the most important part for us was location and this is perfect. It’s blocks from Times Square and Grand Central| right next to Macy’s| and has a Subway station outside the front door that is incredibly useful. Clean and good service too| plus our room had a beautiful view of the Empire State Building. Definitely recommend them.,Dec 28| 2018,5
Great location and spacious.Staff were very helpful and professional. We were very pleased during our stay.,Dec 28| 2018,4
We paid extra for one of the higher floors to get a better view of the NYC skyline| which was beautiful at night| to say the least.  The room was sooo small that we could not set up luggage carousel anywhere as it would block up the flow of traffic in and out of the room or around the bed.  We used the desk to arrange our clothes.  The closet was the size of a gym locker.  Our neighbor across the hall had to put their fold away stroller and carrier outside of their room as I am sure they had the same issues of space.  Positives: The bathroom was a decent size with a walk in shower (no exhaust fan). For 1 or 2 people| wanting to be in the heart of Herald Square| it is a great location| walking distance to Bryant park| Empire State building| easy access to subway system| etc.  Hotel has discounted parking program with Icon Parking around the corner on 6th avenue (cost was still around 100 for 2 nights).  Overall| the stay was average.,Dec 28| 2018,3
Very clean and convenient locationSmall rooms but very nice overall,Dec 28| 2018,5
Pro: decent size room for NYC hotel. Microwave and fridge in the room. Great location and room was quiet.Just a note: the windows were not cleaned (on the inside - greasy marks)Con: Personally I didn't find that the bed was comfortable. It was making noise when moving around in it.No porter and no luggage carts were available when we arrived (maybe it was due to Christmas time)However| I would recommend this hotel| as it has more too offer than others at the same rate.,Dec 28| 2018,4
Amazing location and spectacular views of the Empire State Building from our room. The staff were fantastic!,Dec 27| 2018,5
came for a concert| easy in easy out.  thanks for the great service.,Dec 26| 2018,5
Our stay was excellent! Couldn’t asked for better location| location and location. The room was very clean and spacious| we loved it. Will stay and recomend this place to friends and family. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Simply awesome.,Dec 26| 2018,5
The environment and the service of staff are both great! If we go to New York again| would like to choose here again. Easy to go anywhere very convienently.,Dec 26| 2018,4
Great location!  One block from Harold Square| Macy’s|  and the Empire State Building!  The staff was very helpful with directions and recommendations!,Dec 24| 2018,5
Great staff and price point.  Location was perfect.,Dec 24| 2018,5
Perfect location for getting about the city. Staff were helpful and a few nice touches for Christmas| ie cookies and mulled wine.Overall great stay and would stay again,Dec 24| 2018,5
Perfect area to stay—near Empire State Building| Herald Square| Macy’s and good restaurants.,Dec 19| 2018,5
Family trip. Friendly service| comfortable room| great location! Parking around the corner for a fee. We will definitely return!!,Dec 18| 2018,5
This hotel is our favorite | we have stayed there at least 5 times and always are treated well | room was good and the amenities are always great ! I highly recommend this hotel,Dec 17| 2018,5
Hotel is walking distance to multiple tourist spots. Hotel is loud| small and there is no onsite parking. Definitely wouldn’t stay here again.,Dec 16| 2018,3
The location is central to everything| clean and inviting,Dec 11| 2018,4
Loved the location of this hotel. Very clean and the staff was friendly.,Dec 9| 2018,5
The property is close to many locations that are a must see when visiting NYC at Christmas time. Macy's is around the corner| Times Square is a short walk.,Dec 6| 2018,4
Hotel and room were clean. The staff was very helpful with accommodating early check in and late check out. The hotel was easy walk from Penn station and close to attractions. The room was a little tight| but it’s a nyc hotel. Overall| great experience and would definitely stay here again and plan to in the future. Thank you,Dec 6| 2018,5
The location was perfect.  The hotel was convenient.,Dec 6| 2018,5
The manager helps us with our request to transfer our room from the lower level to the 25th floor.  It was a fabulous room overlooking 6th ave and 35th st where we had a good view of the Macy’s parade.  Small but cozy|clean and helpful staff.  Thanks for a wonderful thanksgiving experience in New York.,Dec 1| 2018,5
Always a wonderful stay.  Staff is so courteous| great location and we never have a bad experience.,Nov 26| 2018,5
Service was good — they kept our bags for us while we went to a show| then came back later and checked in. Room was quite small| even by NYC standards.,Nov 26| 2018,4
Awesome staff! George at the front desk was awesome.  He took care of us and made sure we had a good stay.  Our room was clean and hotel is in good location.  I will be sure to visit this hotel.  Thank you George and the staff at Hilton to ensure our stay was better than good!,Nov 26| 2018,5
Rooms are too small| elevators don't work| didn't clean our room until late in the day| restaurant over priced.,Nov 26| 2018,1
This was a great location to our stay. Everything was about 20 min cab or train ride.,Nov 26| 2018,5
Good location. Close to everything in Manhattan. The rooms are clean. The personnel is very friendly.,Nov 25| 2018,4
The location was perfect and convenient for using the subway. The staff was friendly and helpful. The front door and one of the elevators was out of order| but never caused any trouble due to having two other elevators and a side door.,Nov 24| 2018,4
The rooms are big| the beds comfortable.The location is fantastic.,Nov 22| 2018,5
Great location!!  Within walking distance to most sites.  Room was good for a few nights but beds and pillows weren't the most comfortable.  Room was small but I suspect that is the same with all NYC hotels.,Nov 21| 2018,4
Very nice hotel staff very friendly and rooms clean,Nov 21| 2018,5
Great location| almost all of staff was excellent| great room for NY!,Nov 20| 2018,5
The location was great!  The toilet did not flush very well!,Nov 20| 2018,4
I’ve found my hotel for future NYC trips.  Check in took all of maybe 3 minutes. The room had a beautiful view of the Empire State Building| an empty fridge to use & a microwave.  Never heard any noise from neighboring rooms and very little noise from the hallway| even with a room right across from the elevators.  Great $20 breakfast buffet in a dining area off the lobby & a Starbucks around the corner from the hotel.  Orange line subway stop at the corner| which is also across the street from Macy’s & less than a 10 minute walk to Penn Station / Madison Sqaure Garden. I couldn’t recommend this hotel more.,Nov 19| 2018,5
Really impressed booking online to find that I had a top floor with a beautiful view.,Nov 17| 2018,5
It was close to everything. Transportation| food and activities.,Nov 17| 2018,4
Hotel was in a perfect spot for all sights. View of Empire State Building from our room was beautful. Hotel clean| staff very helpful. Will return again.,Nov 16| 2018,5
Close to empire states building & macys. Very friendly staff/front desk.  No valet was awful (self park is a horror show if coming from out of state and not knowing where you are going),Nov 14| 2018,5
Originally from NYC. I decided to experience the night life while staying in the time square area for a night and I was not impressed by the quality of the hotel. I would expect a bit more from a Hilton Brand hotel| in the past I have stayed in plenty of Hilton affiliated properties with a quality experience but I was not to impressed with this particular property. It wasn't terrible but just ok to say the least. Room/property renovation and more amenities in the hotel will be a plus.,Nov 13| 2018,3
Close to Herald Square !! Great location!! Close to Shake Shake !! Macy’s!!,Nov 12| 2018,5
Room was so small not even space for a suite case,Nov 7| 2018,3
Went here for my Mom's bday. Love the location and convenience. The hotel looks nice. We asked for tiolet paper and did not get until next morning. Had to go to another floor since ice machine was not working. Upon check out they double charged me for incidentals and I showed them my credit card app and the reception person was rude and rolled her eyes at me saying they did not and here is the receipt. I said this is my app on my phone so yes you all did make that mistake or else I would not be charged and she was in denial. Please teach workers better customer service skills cause NYC is a tourist attraction and you want to get people coming back.,Nov 3| 2018,3
Location is really perfect for Time Sq and Broadway. The square out front of the hotel is ideal. Small rooms are no problem| just head down and snack/drink at the square and watch all the activity go by.,Oct 31| 2018,5
its nice hotel & clean| nice food |nice behavior.....,Oct 31| 2018,5
The room we were first given was not clean. We went down to the lobby and got a different room. The rooms are small and the tv does not have very good channels. Also the walls are very thin| we could hear the tv from the next room and people talking outside of the door.,Oct 30| 2018,3
The room was small and old,Oct 29| 2018,3
Great location close to shopping| restaurants and theater.,Oct 29| 2018,5
Didn't like that the parking wasn't included in the price and was not on the same street.,Oct 23| 2018,4
Nice room. Convenient location to Penn Station. A lot of restaurants and cafes nearby.,Oct 23| 2018,4
Great hotel in a central location. Rooms were generously sized| very clean| and comfortable.,Oct 22| 2018,4
Great location to Time Square and Penn Station! Clean and decent room size for NYC.  Only negative is room didn’t get cleaned until 4:45 pm.,Oct 16| 2018,4
Breakfast buffet was quite good.  Staff for breakfast was very friendly and super efficient with service.,Oct 16| 2018,4
Great location| close to all the places we wanted to visit and subway station on corner.,Oct 16| 2018,5
Perfect location!Clean and nice. Team was very helpful,Oct 14| 2018,5
Room was to small| there was not any room for our suitcases other than opening them on the bed and it had a musty smell to it.,Oct 14| 2018,3
Great hotel very close to the Empire State Building| Broadway and Macy's.  Brilliant views of NYC from the higher floors.  Clean| comfortable room of a decent size.,Oct 13| 2018,4
Hilton Garden Inn New York on West 35th Street was ideal for what I was looking for.Staff were friendly and helpful.Room was clean and comfortable. I was on 6th floor so not much of a view| need to be on higher floors for that.Hotel location was central for many attractions and sightseeing,Oct 9| 2018,4
Very conveniently situated in Manhatten. Perfect for a few days in New York,Oct 9| 2018,5
A bit small,Oct 5| 2018,3
Convenient location and good price.  Very nice room.,Oct 2| 2018,5
Hotel was in a great location to visit NYC uptown and downtown. Staff were polite but not overly helpful/knowledgeable.A couple of requests sent via hotels.com were either not received or acted upon.Didn't detract from a fabulous stay in NY.,Oct 2| 2018,4
The hotel was very nice| very good service and great location - but even for NYC standards - the price was too expensive for room size and amenities.,Oct 1| 2018,4
My friend and I booked a double room with the CITY VIEW for 340$ per night (including taxes and fee) which is REALLY overpriced for 3* hotel. At least I expected to have a nice view. They gave us room on 4th floor that faced pipes and junk. Not to say that the bathroom smelled like mold and an old AC was making loud noise. Of course when we asked to change the room they said they are fully booked and there are no rooms available. The only solution offered by hotels.com was 100$ credit for future bookings| which was nice of them but didn’t not fix the problem.,Oct 1| 2018,2
We stayed here for a week as a couple in September on our second visit to the City. Had no problems with the hotel| only the usual inconsiderate guests that decide to hold a lengthy conversation in the corridor outside our room late at night. (this seems to happen in every City hotel we stay in). Staff were friendly and efficient. Check in and out were painless. Had breakfast in the hotel on one occasion and couldn't fault it - plenty to eat/drink. Good service and clean. Had a lovely room with a large window to appreciate the city view we requested.  Rooms were spacious and bathrooms clean with plenty of hot water.,Sep 30| 2018,4
Very clean nice Hotel. Great location. Nice large room,Sep 29| 2018,5
Great location| comfortable room| good price| nice convenience food shop in lobby,Sep 29| 2018,5
hotel VERY near herald square...immediate subway access.  also only 2 blocks from another subway line(penn station.../34th street/7th ave).excellent nyc bagels can be had only 2 blocks west on 35th street(best bagels and coffee...open daily except sunday). brendans restaurant| john sullivans..both excellent restaurants nearby.had a great time. hotel conveniently located. can walk to bryant park/whole foods market| 42nd street. god! i wish we had a whole foods market in my town/county.  recommend this hotel. clean| courteous staff. staff very helpful. printed out my boarding pass.provided recommendations on what to do while in the city.,Sep 25| 2018,5
Hotel was beyond excellent! Great updated rooms with city views and the most attentive staff! Alex at front desk did an especially wonderful job making sure everything during our stay was perfect. Excellent location too. Highly recommend to anyone.,Sep 25| 2018,5
Check out and check in was great. Will be staying again,Sep 23| 2018,5
Very convenient and nice value.Right in heart of Midtown Manhattan. Nice view from room. Respectable price compared to other locations,Sep 17| 2018,5
Great location near tourist attraction! Only concern was the parking. The hotel does not have parking lots in the building and designated preferred parking lot next block. So it might be an issue if you need overloaded stuff to bring to hotel for kids| etc.| then it's challenging. It is a valet parking without in-out privileges| so make sure you take everything you need to your room. And there was pile of garbage in front of the hotel building that never go away or keep coming in. Well| I guess it's not the hotel's fault.Otherwise| the hotel is and my room were all clean and well maintained. My family truly enjoyed the stay. Thanks guys.,Sep 16| 2018,5
Was a great experience. Checking was smooth quick and easy. They were also very accommodating storing our luggage the next day.  Would for sure stay here again.,Sep 16| 2018,5
It’s a nice hotel.  Staff is somewhat friendly| except when it’s really busy| they show their true colors. The hotel is just ok. Rooms on the first floors have an old hotel room feel to them.  The top floor rooms are nice.  It is extremely noisy 24/7 outside the hotel.  Specially on weekends.  Noise makes its way to the rooms.,Sep 14| 2018,3
Nice hotel and great location. Close to a lot of restaurants and shopping area,Sep 14| 2018,4
Fantastic location and within easy walking distance from Penn Station. City view room was perfect with really comfy bed.,Sep 12| 2018,5
Had a business assignment in midtown Manhattan for 2 weeks.  This hotel was 3 blocks from the office and near restaurants and Macy’s. Worked out perfectly.  Comfortable| clean room and friendly staff.  Got a great rate too for NYC.,Sep 12| 2018,4
Very good location. close to time square and subway on door step. room and lobby was really tiny| one chair on table so 2 people can not sit on chair in room!  Have to sit on bed only. only bed side lamp/light in room| not enough.,Sep 11| 2018,4
Very happy with the Hilton. Version friendly and clean.,Sep 10| 2018,5
Small parks like Bryant| Tutor & the Highline were the best finds,Sep 10| 2018,4
Hotel as nice enough.,Sep 8| 2018,4
as always nice location| friendly crew| complimentary water bottles| slow elevator| nothing trendy| old fashion style with carpet| but generally good.,Sep 5| 2018,4
All of the staff were very friendly and very helpful. I don't like that they had garbage in front of the hotel I also don't like that they had people sleeping feet away from the hotel on the street. The parking is horrible. You can park on the street at night but in the morning at a certain time you have to go in a parking garage. Make sure you get the early bird special don't get the hotel's parking service even though they say it's discounted the early bird special in all different parking garages nearby are much cheaper. The rooms were clean and they have more towels on the floor if you need them but you get plenty in your room. I don't think I would come back but I would recommend it..,Sep 5| 2018,3
Good place to stay. Elevators could be too busy at times,Sep 4| 2018,2
This is one of my favorite hotels for my business/pleasure travels| at least once each year.  It has just the right balance of hotel comforts that one has grown to expect from the Hilton brand; safe| clean| friendly - and a location with easy access to everything.,Sep 4| 2018,5
Hotel location is very good for visiting the time square are.The breakfast could be better in terms of choices.,Sep 4| 2018,4
Great location| staff and room quality and cleanliness,Sep 3| 2018,4
Convenient location to stores| attractions and subway. A hop on and off bus is also 1 corner away. Very basic amenities.,Sep 2| 2018,4
Everything was just great from check in to check out..,Sep 2| 2018,5
The hotel is greatly located within walking distance to Penn Station on the 35th Street not far from the Empire State Building.The room was comfortable| clean| of decent size and with good WiFi. Sadly the aircon unit made so much noise that sleeping a full night without being woken up several times is impossible| which defeats the purpose of staying in this hotel| since you want to be able to sleep.,Sep 1| 2018,2
Great location near many sites.  Room was very enjoyable and clean.  Could hear elevators at work since we were located next to shafts.  View was nice heading towards north side.,Aug 29| 2018,4

Excellent in all aspects:  great price point| location| comfort| and the heart of Trump country.,Aug 25| 2018,5
The hotel is a convenient walking distance to Times Square| Central Park| the Empire State Building and Rockefeller Plaza.  We got to the hotel early and there wasn't a room ready yet so the clerk offered to hold our luggage while we explored the area.  Parking is in a garage on the next street behind the hotel.  All the staff was friendly and helpful| the beds were comfortable| and the shower was able to get very hot.  Excellent stay!,Aug 25| 2018,5
The location is good| near Macy's| Penn Station| and many restaurants. We stayed for a night.The room is spacious| but a bit old and dirty. There is a big flat TV| a microwave oven| and a small refrigerator|  but we did not use them. Free wifi is provided| but no USB charger in the room!,Aug 25| 2018,4

The location is very convenient. My room is on 30th flood. I love the view.,Aug 23| 2018,5
Nice hotel close to railway station with beautiful view.,Aug 23| 2018,5
The Hotel is situated very close to Times Square and the Metro so is an ideal place to base a trip to New York from.  There are many hotels in New York all of which have relatively small rooms compared to other cities.  During our stay we stayed in a few hotels in and around the New York area and the Hilton Garden Inn (West Street) was typical of the type offered. The staff were very accommodating and dealt with any queries promptly.,Aug 22| 2018,3
Location was excellent for shopping| attractions  & restaurants. Room size was decent in NYC standard & was clean. Complementary water (no coffee or tea) supply was a joke. 4 nights stay| every night back at hotel 7-8pm| it was always empty or no cups. No ice machine anywhere!! It was 90°F hot summer days. Even 2 stars hotels (most) have better service than this.,Aug 22| 2018,4
Perfect location to my office on Broadway btw 35th and 36th,Aug 22| 2018,4
Good| no pool| very close to times square| parking in the back street| have to adk in reception to direct you to parking,Aug 21| 2018,5

Flott hotell! Utrolig god service| ingen problemer under oppholdet. Anbefales virkelig!,May 3| 2020,4
主要な駅にとても近くどこへ行くにも便利でした。ロビーはこじんまりとしてますが、とても清潔感があり、案内されたお部屋も30階シティービューでニューヨークの夜景を楽しめました。ベッドもとても寝心地が良く、ぐっすりと眠れました。室内にはコーヒーマシンや電子レンジも設備されてありお部屋で朝食も取れました。シャワールームもとても清潔で綺麗です。バスタブは無かったのですが、海外旅行中は使用しないことが多いので気にならなかったです。シャワーもちゃんと熱いお湯が出て良かったです。笑ただ一つ、壁はそんなに厚くないのか、廊下で大声で話している人の声が少し気になりました。それ以外は全体的に満足です。また利用したいと思います。,Mar 15| 2020,4
This hotel has an amazing location| a couple of steps away from times square. Subwaystation right outside the hotel| and a lot of shopping|dining etc in the area. Friendly and very helpful staff made this a great experience. I would absolutely recommend this hotel.,Mar 11| 2020,4

Vår vistelse var bra. Hotellet var väldigt bra till för oss| nära shopping och sevärdheter. Hotellet var rent och fint| vi fick bo på 27 av 31 våningar och då var utsikten väldigt fin| men lägre ner i huset kan det ha varit lite mer dystert då ett relativt stort hus fanns på andra sidan gatan.,Jan 14| 2020,5
Très bien placé au cœur de la cité à deux pas de Time square et au pied de Macy’s,Jan 12| 2020,5
Mi estadía no fue  placentera porque iba  solo a Nueva York con mi hijo de 13 años y reserve una habitación con dos camas y  me alojaron en una habitación de una sola cama y no huno ningún interés por parte del hotel por remediar esta situación,Jan 10| 2020,3
Hotel w idealnym miejscu dla tych | którzy chcą zwiedzać NYC ! Pokój wygodny dla 4 osób (dwa łóżka queen size| )| lodówka| ekspress do kawy| herbaty| dookoła mnóstwo miejsc gdzie można niedrogo zjeść.Nie próbowaliśmy śniadań w hotelu| więc nie mamy zdania. Z pobytu jesteśmy bardzo zadowoleni i następnym razem wybralibyśmy go ponownie.,Jan 10| 2020,5

시설이 낙후 되었고 무엇보다 히터가 제대로 안되어서 추웠습니다. 이불은 오래되었으며| 가성비는 좋지 않은 듯 합니다. 또한| 리셉션 직원도 불친절해서| 아시아인들에게만 그런건지 좀 의아합니다. 딱하나 좋은건 위치입니다,Nov 14| 2019,2

部屋の広さはマンハッタン の中では十分広かった。高層階では眺めが良いが、言わないと2階に割り当てられた。騒音を考えても高層階をリクエストすべき。あとは極めて普通でした。,Oct 27| 2019,3

Lo que mas me gusto fue la situacion pero el hotel necesita una reforma. Creo que es poco decir que el ascensor es de cuando nacio mi abuela. Mi habitacion y mi wc no era antiguo pero la de mis hermanos creo que no han tenido una reforma desde que se abrió el hotel,Aug 29| 2019,3
Me gusto el aire acondicionado y lo bien situado que está| parada de metro en la puerta.,Aug 27| 2019,5
Hotel sulla 35ma a 2 passi dall'empire. Zona molto trafficata| caotica e sporca. Le volte precedenti eravamo stati più a nord ed era meglio| ma non è certo colpa dell'hotel! Struttura pulita| ma stanze veramente piccole per 4 persone. Bagno pulito. Tutti gli accessori presenti. Non lo consiglierei per la zona.,Aug 21| 2019,4
在市中心，交通方便。服務親切。乾淨整潔。,Aug 20| 2019,5
Hotel limpo e super bem localizado. Estação do metrô praticamente ao lado do hotel. Pessoal atenciosos. Eles tem um sala só para ficarem com as malas para quem chega cedo demais ou tem que fazer check-out até meio dia e quer ficar na cidade mais um pouco que foi o nosso caso. Nosso vôo era á noite. Tem frigobar| micro ondas| máquina de café aliás muito boa por sinal e café e chás no quarto. Wifi todo no quarto e em todo hotel grátis. Não tomamos café da manhã. 3 Elevadores grandes. Sabonetes e shampoo Neutrogena. Toalhas limpas e trocadas diariamente. Ótimo chuveiro e com banheira. Não tivemos problemas algum. Única coisa que me incomodou um pouco foi o tamanho da cama que é aquelas normal| não são queen e nem king| mas nada que desabone o hotel. Com certeza voltarei. Super recomendo.,Aug 12| 2019,5
Excellent service et magnifique vue sur l’Empire State Building.  Très bien situé aussi.  La machine à café ne fonctionnait pas le premier matin.  Le personnel l’a remplacé rapidement av3c un sourire.,Aug 11| 2019,5

I am overall  happy with  the stay at  the hotel.  Great location|,Jul 22| 2019,5
Everything was great. Only booked a room with view on the city and expected to be able to see the empire state building| but turned out to be a room at the other side of the building. Anyway still a good view from the 24th floor :-),Jul 21| 2019,5

Hotellin sijainti on aivan loistava. Palvelu oli mutkatonta ja tehokasta. Huone oli hieman vaatimattomampi kuin kuvista syntynyt vaikutelma. Hotellilla oli edessään jopa pienen pieni aukio| mikä on nykissä harvinaista.,Jul 3| 2019,4
Wir hatten etwas per Paketdienst zum Hotel schicken lassen. Auf Grund der Weihnachtszeit konnte der Liefertermin seitens USPS nicht eingehalten werden| so dass das Paket erst nach Abreise eintraf. An der Rezeption bat ich um Möglichkeiten einer Annahmeverweigerung oder aber Rücksendung des Pakets. Man gab uns die Visitenkarte des Managers wir solltennihn diesbezüglich anschreiben. Beide E-Mails wurden vom Manager ignoriert. Auch der Zusatz Honeymoon hat leider keinerlei Reaktion seitens des Hotelmanagements hervorgebracht. Im Gegenteil| wir fanden zwei leere Wasserflaschen im Mülleimer bei Ankunft vor. Gegenüber einem Aufenthalt von 2014 wo alles perfekt war inkl. Empire State Building View und eine 100%ige Weiterempfehlung von uns zu jetzt in 2018 eine  Kehrtwende um 180Grad| definitiv keine Weiterempfehlung| da kein Service nachdem das Geld geflossen ist und Ignoranz seitens des Managers.,Jul 2| 2019,2

Sehr zentral. Ein passendes Hotel um New York zu Fuß| aber auch mit der U-Bahn zu erkunden.,Jun 26| 2019,4
Super Lage mitten in Midtown| nettes Personal| vernünftige Zimmer. Einziger Haken ist der Lautstärkepegel. Nachts tatsächlich kein so großes Problem| das selbst in New York dann ruhiger wird aber tagsüber und abends schon deutlich hörbar. Immer noch schleierhaft| warum nicht auch die amerikanischen Hotels dazu übergehen Doppelverglasung zu nutzen. Es wäre so einfach.,Jun 23| 2019,4
Hotellet ligger veldig bra plassert. Ren og fint hotell med god størrelse på rommet. God service og rask innsjekking og utsjekking. Sengen var god nok.Renholderne banker på rommet kl 9 hver dag| så du trenger ingen vekkeklokke.Byskatt er inkludert i prisen noe som er bra.,Jun 18| 2019,5

Only issues were with the key cards and coffee refills but everything was solved quickly and not really a problem. Only had breakfast there on the last day. It wasn't very good but there were enough locations around the hotel to have a nice breakfast. Location was fantastic! I will definitely be back!,Jun 5| 2019,5

가격 위치 청결도 친절도 모두 만족입니다. 바로 옆 한국식당 있어 편리합니다. 다만 주자장 요금 결재에 대한 사전공지가 필요할듯 합니다. 요금을 호텔에 내야하는데 안내를 받지못해 체크아웃후 주차장에서 다시 호텔로 왔었습니다.,May 28| 2019,5

良いところは、なんといっても便利な立地！地下鉄の出入口もすぐ。空の冷蔵庫あり。電子レンジあり。（使い方わからず）悪いところは、エレベーターがなかなか来ない。湯沸かしポットが無く、お湯が沸かせないので、持って行ったティーバッグが飲めない。カプセルを押し込むコーヒーマシンがあるが、2人なのにコーヒーも紅茶も一個ずつ。追加を頼んだら2時間も来なかった。湯沸かしポットは借りられず、お湯もないとのこと。電子レンジで沸かせというが、部屋には紙コップしかなく、結局諦めた。翌日は、昼頃出かけて夜中に帰ったら、掃除されてなかった。タオルを載せた台車が廊下のすみにあったので、自分で取った。前回泊まった時は、いい印象しかないのに、今回残念。水圧普通。シャワーは固定。歯ブラシ、スリッパ無し。あるのはシャンプー、コンディショナー、シャワージェル、石けん。,May 19| 2019,3
J'ai tout aimé. Nous avons eu la chance d'avoir une chambre en hauteur face à l'empire state|bulding. Emplacement de l'hôtel en plein centre de Manathan|  à proximité dy metro....,May 6| 2019,4
L’hotel est proche du centre de Manhattan et par conséquent c’est une base de départ très pratique pour découvrir NYC. Une station de métro (34th Street) est à 30m et l’Empire State Building à 200m. Nous avions une chambre (Family Room) au 26ème étage et par conséquent la vue sur la ville était magnifique. Le personnel de l’hôtel est absolument charmant et très réactif. La seule ombre au tableau est donc la modernité. Tout est un peu passé de mode .... mais bon| vu que nous étions dans notre chambre seulement pour y dormir| ce fut parfait quand même !,May 4| 2019,3
スタッフの方はとても親切でしたがエレベーター近くの部屋だった為、機械の音が気になりました,May 2| 2019,4
La ubicación es perfecta y el personal muy amable.,Apr 28| 2019,5

Bra hotell| sköna sängar| jättebra med kylskåp och kaffemaskin. inte mitt i ruschen på Manhattan men ändå väldigt nära till allt. Så vi trivdes bra| empire State building gatan bredvid och fler ok frukostställen runt omkring. Skulle rekommendera hotellet till andra.  men blev riktigt besviken när jag bad om hjälp med att boka taxi till flygplatsen och frågar specifikt om det blir dyrare då och om det är enklare att jag stannar en taxi själv. Det skulle gå jättebra att boka via hotellet och skulle bli samma kostnad som en ”vanlig taxi” 73 dollar inkl skatter och dricks.Försäkrade mig också när vi satte oss i bilen om att det skulle bli ”vanlig” taxa| ja visst som uppgjort med hotellet. När vi kom fram slutade notan på över 100 dollar. Mest trist att jag litade på svaren jag fick. Vet inte vart det felade| men för mig blev det hotellet som jag tappade förtroende för.,Mar 23| 2019,4
Otelin konumu harika. Metro çıkışta hemen yanınızda| Macy’s karşı blokda| 5. Cadde| Times meydanı yürüme mesafede. Ayrıca penn station| port authority’de yine otobüs veya trenle ulaşım için yakınlar.

ממש נהנו מהשהות במלון| המיקום מעולה קרוב לכל איזור השופינג| צמוד לתחנת רכבת| איזור עם אווירה טובה. פינקו אותנו בגלל הירח דבש בקומה גבוהה עם נוף לבנין אמפייר סטייט וזו היתה חוויה מעולה. החדר יחסית גדול למלונות בניו יורק היה לנו מקום להכל. נקי ומסודר תמיד. מאוד ממליצה!,Mar 19| 2019,5

タイムズスクエアへのアクセスも近く、地下鉄の駅も真横にあります。ベッドも大きく部屋もアパホテル等のビジネスホテルよりも広いので、出張や一人旅には最適だと思います。直接大通りに面しているわけではないので、夜中は道路の音も気になりません。アメニティに歯ブラシや化粧水、洗顔はないので、持参することをお勧めします。(歯ブラシは受付に言えば貰えますが、歯磨き粉はありません),Mar 16| 2019,5

Fint hotell midt i sentrum/midtown|fem minutters gange til Times square| t-bane stasjon rett utenfor døren| Empire state building rett rundt hjørnet.Viktig å bo høyt opp (uansett hvilket  hotell) med tanke på støy fra utryknings kjøretøy.Veldig gode senger| bra renhold| fint bad med påfyll av toalettartikler hver dag| store rom.Bor gjerne på dette hotellet flere ganger.,Feb 28| 2019,5

Sehr gute Lage| alles in Midtown fussläufig in wenigen Minuten zu erreichen. Macy‘s ist schräg gegenüber. Metro und Busse quasi vor der Tür. Unbedingt ein Zimmer mit City View buchen| mann kriegt ein Zimmer mit Empire State Building oder Rockefeller Center Ausblick| da diese Zimmer auf oberen Etagen sind| ist es auch viel ruhiger als „ unten „Das Bett und das Badezimmer waren sauber| der Kaffe für die Kaffeemaschine wurde jeden Tag aufgefüllt. Das nächste mal gerne wieder dieses Hotel.,Feb 25| 2019,5
Nous sommes arrivés fatigués après un long périple du Canada en voiture. Arrivée compliquée avec la réception qui nous disait n’avoir qu’une chambre pour nous| alors que nous étions 4!! Aucun effort pour nous comprendre| limite arrogant.Autrement| hôtel très bien situé dans New York.Chambres trop petites| on a du mal à ouvrir les valises.,Feb 24| 2019,3
Es ist praktisch und unkompliziert mit dem Subway gutes Umgebung zum einkaufen Es ist sehr ein schönes smile City Gerne kommen wir wieder :),Feb 23| 2019,5
Veldig fornøyd med pris og beliggenhet på hotellet. Personalet var hyggelig å behjelpelig. Frokosten var noe dyr for min smak| så vi spiste den ute. Rommene var helt OK .De hadde kjøleskap og micro| som gjorde at det var mulig og ha med seg mat og drikke på rommet.Rengjøringen var bra| å rommene var reine til en hver tid.Bor gjerne på hotellet neste tur også,Feb 22| 2019,4
밤에 엄청 시끄럽고 방이 너무 좁다돈을 더주고 힐튼 타임스스퀘어로 잡으세요!!,Feb 21| 2019,2

Hotel très bien placé| à un prix correct pour l'emplacement. Les chambres sont bien équipées| le service à la réception très aimable. Seuls petits points faibles: le thermostat du chauffage en chambre ne semble pas toujours fonctionner| et on peut attendre trop longtemps les ascenseurs à certaines heures| mais vraiment dans l'ensemble c'est très bien.,Feb 12| 2019,5
위치가 좋았습니다. 서비스도 좋았어요! 청결했고 난방도 나쁘지 않았습니다. 조용하면서도 시티뷰를 즐길수 있어 진짜 뉴욕에 온 기분이 확 났습니다.,Feb 12| 2019,5
Posizione top per visitare la città| adiacente fermata metropolitana. Personale reception preparato e gentile. Servizi nella norma per una catena di questo livello. Decisamente da migliorare le pulizie: trovati diversi capelli sul copriletto e sporcizia sotto il letto. Termoconvettore riscaldamento e frigobar fastidiosi per il rumore.,Feb 10| 2019,4
O hotel é muito bem localizado| numa área repleta de lojas e restaurantes| e próximo de vários pontos turísticos. Arrumação e limpeza satisfatórias. Ficaram com as nossas malas antes do check in e depois do check out. Funcionários simpáticos e prestativos.,Feb 7| 2019,5

타임스퀘어에 15분이면 걸어갈수 있어요. 왠만한 뉴욕 명소와는 가까워 좋습니다. 그리고 시내에 위치하여 음식점과 시설이용에 좋아요. 너무 시내에 있다보니 방은 좀 작고 뷰는 별로 입니다. 그리고 직원들이 그리 친절하진 않아요. 호텔직원이라기보다 그냥그러네요,Jan 27| 2019,5
가성비 대비 좋습니다 가격 위치 청결도 모두~브로드웨이도 가깝고 코리안타운이라 음식도 편하고 심지어 한국마트가 다음 블럭에 있어 편리 했어요,Jan 26| 2019,4
Ótimos localização| atendimento e organização.,Jan 22| 2019,5
아주 최적의 장소였어요. 따뜻했고 조용했구요. 다만 카페트에 이불이 자주 떨어지는 것과 슬리퍼가 없는 점이 아쉬웠어요.또 가족이니만큼 샴푸가 많이 필요한데 한 개씩만 제공되고 치약이 없어 아쉬웠네요.그거 빼곤 전반적으로 좋았어요,Jan 12| 2019,5
El hotel está perfectamente colocado. La atención ha sido muy buena. Sólo faltaría alguien más que hablara español.,Jan 7| 2019,5
This is a fantastic place to stay since the staff members| like Kim and her senior manager| are so kind and the room was great. I strongly recommend that travelers stay this place when they visit New York city!!!,Jan 5| 2019,5
Funcionario pouco solicitos,Jan 5| 2019,4
エンパイアステートビルのすぐ近く。部屋の窓からよく見えました。地下鉄の駅から徒歩5分以下で、どこへ行くにも便利だと思いました。,Jan 5| 2019,3
部屋が 2階でチョットうるさいのと、エアコンがチョット不安定な感じで環境が微妙かも夜中にごみが回収に来るのがうるさかった。出てすぐに地下鉄の駅が有るしタイムズスクエアにも歩いて６、７分で立地は最高です。,Jan 4| 2019,3
Ótima localização para tudo. Confortável.,Jan 2| 2019,5
Hotel nel cuore di downtown. Stazione subway a 50 metri con 2 linee che ti permettono di raggiungere ogni parte della città in modo molto facile. Le camere sono un po’ datate però confortevoli e pulite. Bella la vista dalle camere sopratutto la sera. Ottimo rapporto qualità/prezzo,Jan 2| 2019,4
Muy accesible a los lugares de interés| bien comunicado!!,Jan 1| 2019,4
Hotellet lå fantastisk| meget centralt. Der var stille om natten. Dobbeltsengene er ikke så store. Jeg tror| ati de var under 140 cm. Værelset var lidt slidt. God udsigt og venligt personale.,Dec 29| 2018,3
Hotel muito bem situado| numa rua calma| mas apenas a 2 quarteirões de Times Square.Quarto com espaço suficiente| e 2 camas de casal (embora relativamente estreitas para duas pessoas).WC completo e espaçoso.Wi-Fi rápido e gratuito.Aconselho vivamente.,Dec 26| 2018,5
Wonderful view| wonderful room| good beds and wonderful bathroom,Dec 25| 2018,5

Emplacement idéal pour le shopping! Tout près de Time Square. Petit déjeuner complet.,Nov 27| 2018,5
beliggenheden er i top men værelset er nedslidt og gammeldags uden nogen form for siddepladser og med for store møbler| der ikke passer til værelset. Kaffe| som sidste gang i vestibulen er væk| elevator fungerede kun en gang imellem - så desværre - alt for dyrt i forhold til indholdet,Nov 26| 2018,3
Ótima localização| perfeito para quem gosta das compras. Ficamos em andar alto com vista para o Empire State. Quarto super confortável amplo| banheiro espaçoso e cheiroso| ducha incrível. O quarto tem frigobar grande| microondas e uma cafeteira que serve café com cápsulas. Atendimento 10. Valeu muito a pena hospedar e recomendo. Não tomei café da manhã pois não está incluso na diária e paga se a parte. Hotel realmente cumpre o que está escrito. Próximo você encontra lojas diversas de marcas famosas. Vc faz tudo a pé. Tem boas comidas por quilo super gostosas nas proximidades. Voltarei em breve a New York| e ficarei com certeza neste hotel !,Nov 19| 2018,4
ヒルトンとはいえビジネスホテルだろうし…と余り期待していなかったのですが、タオルにはちょっと感動しました。清潔で吸水性も肌触りもとても良かったです。シャワーヘッドの打たせ湯モードもベッドリネンもお気に入りです。また宿泊したいです。,Nov 7| 2018,5
Buenisima ubicación| personal y accesible al metro a sitios de interés,Nov 6| 2018,4
位置方便，房價整潔，房內設施齊全唯一的問題是，續住訂單明明是 一大床，詢問櫃檯能否繼續原本房間續住，櫃檯一直堅持我訂的是兩床房，叫我們一定要換房間...真的無語！最後因為我們堅持下，櫃檯還是讓我們續住同一間房,Nov 6| 2018,4
Achei otimo o hotel. Excelente localizaçao| limpeza e quarto bons. O quarto dispõe de uma pequena geladeira| microondas e máquina de café. Recomendo e voltarei.,Oct 23| 2018,5
O hotel é muito bem localizado| metrô a 100 metros| compras e opções de refeição perto. O único problema foram os elevadores| são 3 elevadores para mais de 30 andares e mais de uma vez na parte da manhã| bem movimentada| um dos elevadores não estava funcionando.,Oct 14| 2018,4
muy buena servicio ! Buen punto para hacer shopping,Oct 2| 2018,5
Hotels hade utlovat ett rum med specifika sängar - detta bekräftades i e-post till mig. Hotellet ansåg inte att man var bunden vid avtalet till Hotels - jag klagade förstås - och skickade meddelande till Hotels som inte agerade. Jag kan konstaterat att såväl Hotels och Hotellet inte fullgör sin tjänst på ett seriöst sätt. Därför får såväl Hotellet som Hotels dåliga recensioner av mig.,Sep 24| 2018,1
Highly recommend - maintained well in an great location and the staffs are friendly.,Sep 19| 2018,4
Christmas in New York is great,May 14| 2021,5
Excellent location in midtown,Mar 12| 2020,5
The larger rooms (by New York standards) and the gym were great features,Mar 5| 2020,5
Nice room| solid bed| lots of hot water. great selection of TV channels| great restaurant Herb 'n' Kitchen| friendly staff,Mar 4| 2020,5
The grab and go kitchen had hot food and good selection. Great for on the way to early am meetings.,Mar 2| 2020,5
I was very happy with my stay. The staff was wonderful!,Feb 25| 2020,5
The rooms were tiny| which can be understood given it is NY. However| they were so dry and dusty that we had issues simply sleeping for the entire stay. No amount of water or keeping the windows open spared us from the dry air.Aditionally| a magical charge of $68.86 showed up on my card and there was no one to contact. Customer service directed me to concierge who was never available. I even sent an email to the address they asked me to| and no response.Was it a good stay? Sure| it offered a bed and a decently clean room. Would I stay there again? Never.,Feb 24| 2020,1
The location is phenomenal for what we were doing.  We walked everywhere!  MoMA| Rockefeller Center| NY Public Library| etc.The food options in the lobby were also super healthy which is MUCH appreciated!!!,Feb 22| 2020,5
The rooms were spacious and clean.  Loved the fridge would have liked a small microwave.Beds were not that comfortable.Towels could have been a bit softer. Some of the hallways  there was wallpaper peeling.What I really d id not like was the mandatory $30 that was charged to my room daily and had to be used in the bar and snack shop. I am not a drinker to being forced to spend money in a bar was not nice. overall did not like being forced to spend any money on overpriced drinks and snacks. This is the hotels way of making sure that you don't get your full room deposit back.,Feb 20| 2020,4
The property is kinda dated; great location though,Feb 18| 2020,3
Took about 40 minutes to check in!,Feb 18| 2020,4
I like the locationDon’t like some of the amenities,Feb 18| 2020,4
Great| lively location. Rooms large by NYC standards.,Feb 17| 2020,5
Waiting 20 minutes to check in at 11:30 pm.  After waiting 30 minutes earlier in the day| only to be told that it would cost $55 to check in early.  Then another line and $5 more to leave one small piece of luggage.,Feb 16| 2020,1
Check in wait and wait for car at parking lot was awful,Feb 16| 2020,3
I booked this specifically because it was dog friendly for larger dogs. No place for the dog to use the bathroom. Their answer was pee and poop on the sidewalk. Parking was a nightmare. No valet except once you’re already in the garage. The room was falling apart and one of the most disappointing of our travels up the east coast for the cost. I booked the Hilton bc of their name and reputation. But I was very disappointed.,Feb 15| 2020,1
The propoerty was extremely convenient.  Close to key locations.,Feb 12| 2020,3
The check-in line needed more employees| line took too long. We also had to pay to store our bags after checkout while we waited to head to the airport. Which is ridiculous. Our suite was very nice and had plenty of room for a family of 5. The bar was extremely overpriced. The average mixed drink is $15-$19. The staff was very pleasant and accommodating.,Feb 10| 2020,4
The Hilton waited until I arrived at 10:45 pm to advise me that notwithstanding my valid reservation through Hotels.com| they had no room for me.  No explanation was provided.  The offered me a room at a property several blocks away| with the option to check out of that hotel the next day and check into the Hilton for the remainder of my trip| which I declined to do.  This is an abhorrent business practice.  The Hilton knew that they were not going to provide me a room| but waited until I arrived (in the hopes that I would not| allowing them to charge me for the non-existent room) to advise me that I was out of luck.  I will never stay at this property again and it tarnishes the entire chain.,Feb 7| 2020,1
Good executive lounge and very well maintained property,Feb 5| 2020,5
Great central location within walking distance to Times Square| Central Park,Feb 4| 2020,5
The room was excellent. However the food options were disappointing. I would have liked one full service restaurant.,Feb 1| 2020,4
Great location. Nice hotel amenities. Friendly and helpful staff,Jan 31| 2020,5
too much noise and limited services. i have been disappointed.,Jan 30| 2020,2
A couple Towels had some dirt on them| but most were clean,Jan 30| 2020,5
The only thing that would have made my stay better would have been having a coffee maker in the room.,Jan 28| 2020,4
I wish there was a coffee maker in the room and we would have liked more options for room service.,Jan 28| 2020,5
Staff are so accommodating and friendly nothing is too much. Great location and was given a room with a view plus late check out free of charge. Highly recommend this hotel,Jan 27| 2020,5
Hotel staff was very accommodating but the hotel need some TLC. I found my email little dirty. Little stains on sheets and blankets| there was still trash stuffed in the middle of the dresser/refrigerator and wall. Anytime you turned on hot water a loud sound would happen| for about 60 seconds. Minor issues. The hotel is in a good location tho.,Jan 26| 2020,4
I was a bit disappointed with the restaurant menu| especially for breakfast.,Jan 24| 2020,4
My husbend and I stayed at Hilton Midtown for 5 nights a week ago. Because it was relatively warm outside| hotel management decided to shut down whole heating system in the building. But the huge problem was that NOONE INFORMED us about that. Thinking that we put heating on high while went to bed| we slept under cold air coming out of the system.Of course I got sick| missed two meetings next day| travelled overseas in terrible condition with high fever and even now| after three days of arrival| I am on antibiotics. P.S. management did not even apologize| they just sent an extra blanket for me.,Jan 15| 2020,2
old room with poor maintenance - lack of cleanliness,Jan 10| 2020,3
They wanted to charge $55 to check in three hours early. But $55?,Jan 10| 2020,4
We were in a handicap room and my daughter who was sick needed to take a bath| but there wasn't a bathtub.  We requested another room| and the manager was rude| and demeaning.  Horrible customer service.  We arrived off a plane from CA and got to hotel with many other people exhausted| tired and hungry.  There was no room service!,Jan 9| 2020,1
Inexpensive| close to Lincoln Center. Not much more to say than that. It's a great budget option if you're seeing an opera that doesn't get out until 11PM!,Jan 9| 2020,4
Great location| many sightseeings on a walking distance (MOMA| Central Park| Empire State Building| Radio City Music Hall| Rockefeller Center...).The Hilton is a very big hotel| therefore there were lines at the elevators| at the coffee bar and at the bar over Christmas. Apart from this I would definitely go back.,Jan 8| 2020,4
It was really super great and wonderful and i had no problems,Jan 7| 2020,4
Good location. Rude staff. Rooms can use an up-date,Jan 7| 2020,3
Perfect location to get to almost anywhere near Time Square in Mid-Town Manhattan by foot...taxi ride to places such as WTC Memorial and the NY Manhattan Cruise Terminal was very affordable,Jan 7| 2020,5
The room Was available early. BUT charged me 55 dollars to get in room early.  I thought this was totally wrong.   No one was going to use the room until I got in| so why charge me to get in it.  Will not be staying here again if they don’t comp me on this. And then another 34 dollars for resort fee?? Wow. Cost me 329 and 70 for parking to stay from 3pm until 12 the next day.  So overrated!!!!   400 a night| never again. Not worth it!  Off season! New Years and Christmas was over!,Jan 5| 2020,5
perfect located at the heart of manhattan| near and close of everything at Nyc,Jan 5| 2020,5
Excellent property| excellent location!! Always a favorite!!,Jan 5| 2020,5
The resort fee is charged| regardless of whether you use it or not.,Jan 5| 2020,4
My daughter and I stayed at the hotel over the Holidays (2019) and the hotel was extremely busy with so many tourists. We found that the hotel staff was patient and friendly| from check-in to our house keeper| taking care of so many people and their needs. We enjoyed our stay!!,Jan 4| 2020,5
Great double bed suite for the family and breakfast in executive lounge.,Jan 4| 2020,5
The only bad doesn’t have coffee machine in the room,Jan 4| 2020,4
Amazing hotel. Staff is great| room was very clean and location of the hotel is a big plus. Thank you Hilton.,Jan 4| 2020,5
The hotel is close to the metro station|  10 min walk to time square| 5 min walk to central park| rooms are very clean and very comfortable. Nice time there. Thanks,Jan 4| 2020,5
great location| very friendly staff.Nice ambience,Jan 3| 2020,5
all the staff pretty much very rude. didn't care about or demonstrate an empathy when we raised an issue we were having.,Jan 3| 2020,3
Good location| but overall cleanliness| comfort| service is average.I would chose different hotel instead.,Jan 3| 2020,2
I was able to check in quickly| less than 5 minutes. The room was clean and hade enough towels. The food market seriously lacked in service. The register was unmanned for several minutes with 7 people in line.,Jan 2| 2020,5
I was say it was extremely frustrating because our keys kept failing to open our room.,Jan 2| 2020,2
This hotel is located in a great location! Perfect for me and my family of four.,Jan 1| 2020,5
It was spacious rooms. Didn’t like all the hidden fees you have to spend at the hotel per day,Dec 31| 2019,3
Erratic replenishment of bathroom toiletries was the only irritant,Dec 31| 2019,4
Great hotel for Christmas visit!! Close to everything| walking distance.,Dec 30| 2019,4
Location was great and the food were very delicious,Dec 30| 2019,4
Terrible service.  Hotel is grossly understaffed.  Booked room for 4 (2 adults and 2 children)| but room only had 2 sets of towels and no sheets for the pull-out sofa bed.  Hilton staff did not answer phone when I tried to call operator and customer service.  I had to go down to the front desk and wait in line for ~45 minutes.  Front desk understaffed and those that were working were confused and apparently trainees.  Anyway| I finally got towels & sheets 2 hours later.  I will not stay at any more Hiltons - you're over-paying for a name brand that is no guarantee for quality or service.  Expensive hotel room for no good reason| and wasted a lot of time trying to chase down simple service requests.  There are many other mid-town hotels to choose from.,Dec 30| 2019,2
The room and facilities were great.  However| we did have a few issues with the room.  Our bathroom lock was broken| and we were locked out of our bathroom.  A wonderful employee by the name of Patrick fixed it for us.Our room was terribly hot.  We called maintenance FOUR TIMES during our stay.  They never answered our calls| nor did they return them.  It made for some miserable time in the room.  The thermostat was obviously broken.  The customer care at the hotel lacks professionalism and promptness.  We had two employees walk away from us as we were asking them questions.  They were very rude and not helpful:  Brian Obot and Mark| whose last name I did not get.  They literally turned away from us as we were asking our questions and were extremely rude-- giving one word answers and walking away while we were still talking.,Dec 29| 2019,4
Wonderful hotel with the best location in NYC. Very friendly and helpful staff. I love it here!,Dec 29| 2019,5
It’s located in the heart of amenities. Hotel is immaculately clean - very festive for Christmas holiday travel.  Beautiful hotel,Dec 29| 2019,5
Excellent location; we were able to walk to many places and had quick access to subway.,Dec 28| 2019,4
Waited in line for 45 minutes to check in. Only one of our rooms was ready. Paid for both and came back later to get keys for the second room. Had to wait another 35-40 minutes just to get the keys. They only had one person running the check in area and a huge line. Couldn’t run the water in the bathroom sink for very long as it didn’t drain. Toilet didn’t work properly either. You could hear all outside noises from room all night.,Dec 28| 2019,2
The hotel was in the perfect location - close enough to Times Square but far enough to be away from the noise.  Short walk to the park or subway.  Hotel was very clean; nice bar & deli/store for quick bites and coffee.   Only real complaint is that the bathroom vanity space was little to none.  Would definitely stay here again.,Dec 28| 2019,5
Bathroom sink was clogged and it backed up with black gunk. Otherwise| property is lovely and in an ideal location,Dec 28| 2019,5
Nice rooms.. Good service!! Very accommodating.  Would definitely stay here again I'm the future.  Great location.,Dec 27| 2019,4
It was okay. Not worth what I paid for the night. Sheets were not clean upon check in. They had stains on them. Small issue with check in that was quickly fixed. The bar service was slow. The best part of the hotel is its location.,Dec 27| 2019,3
It was the weekend before Christmas| so we expected that the hotel would be booked. We also expected that it would be overbooked| as hotels will typically do this to ensure capacity. However| upon checking in at the appointed check-in time| we were told that the room we had booked| sleeping five (king size bed and pull out sofa bed)| was no longer available. The front desk clerk then told us she could get us a room with two queen size beds. We accepted that room| knowing we could squeeze five people into the room. When we went to the room it only had one queen size bed. No couch| no chairs. We thought the front desk clerk simply made a mistake and went back down to the front desk to get new room keys. When we explained to the front desk clerk that the room she gave us only had one bed| for five people| she yelled at us and told us that we agreed to that accommodation. She told us we would have to wait two hours to speak to the manager because he was very busy. We explained that the room she gave us would require that| at a minimum| two people would have to sleep on the floor! She complained to us that the hotel had overbooked and there was nothing she could do. Another front desk clerk stepped in to help us| as it was clear that we were upset and the new room was unacceptable. After a few minutes of searching| the second front desk clerk found us a room with two queen sized beds. The hotel's front desk manager| when told what happened| also credited our bill.,Dec 27| 2019,2
This is my third year staying at the Hilton Midtown for Christmas. As usual| it was an excellent experiece. The staff is friendly| helpful| and responsive. The hotel's location is ideal| and the rooms are clean and comfortable.,Dec 26| 2019,5
We had a wonderful time in NYC prior to the holidays.  The location is PERFECT.,Dec 24| 2019,5
Bathroom is poorly designed with no counter space. Room is too dark without enough mirrors. Adding retractable or folding counter space in the bathroom would be an easy fix. :-),Dec 24| 2019,3
Great location| right in the heart of the city and can walk to everything. We didn’t get the room we booked however| because the hotel was packed (12/22 stay). Lines to checkin took about 45 min| they only had 2 ppl at the desk...but again maybe it was because of the holiday crowd? Hotel was beautiful| rooms were nice| bathroom wasn’t the cleanest (hair in shower..) but all in all a nice hotel and stay.,Dec 24| 2019,4
Overall good experience. For some reason my 3 nights stay was broken to 2 check-in.I had to come to the desk the second day to register again...,Dec 23| 2019,5
Great location to everything for walking.  The room was too hot and temperature wouldn’t go down.,Dec 23| 2019,3
Location is great and that is what you are paying for. Otherwise this is a mid level hotel| not a luxury one. Check in was awful and after going through the line three times to get rooms all on one floor|  that still didn't happen.  The manager was rude. They comped us 80 in drinks (cost us $95 at the bar for 8 people| so no great savongs| and 40 in food). You will have to pay $5 cash per bag to have bags held. Modern finish|  slapped over some aging features. No water pressure in the shower.  They were jam packed for the holidays| so that could have affected things. Overall| location is the draw.,Dec 23| 2019,3
I was given a room set up for handicapped persons and the shower arrangement was very difficult to use and sprayed water all over the floor outside the shower.,Dec 23| 2019,3
Supposed to cost $55 extra for early check in then they charge me $75 and when I questioned it| there was some mumbling about taxes. I don’t buy it,Dec 22| 2019,3
I truly enjoy staying here.  So close to so many things.  Great service.,Dec 20| 2019,5
I had a wonderful stay! Thank you!!,Dec 19| 2019,5
The AC was off and only the heater was on in the rooms. It was not cool at all,Dec 17| 2019,3
Very nice hotel. Great location,Dec 16| 2019,5
Great location| excellent staff| overall great experience!,Dec 16| 2019,5
I don't like to write reviews!  Our one night stay was just what we needed,Dec 16| 2019,5
Great location to see the Christmas sights. Right in the heart of the city,Dec 16| 2019,5
We PAID for WiFi| which didn’t work| and the phone in the room also did not work| making it difficult to call to ask about the WiFi.  The room was warm and the temperature setting would only go down to 68 degrees.The roll-in shower’s shower head pointed at the wall but was too high to move it if you were in a wheel chair. Even so| it was impossible not to soak the entire bathroom floor.The lightning in the room was poor.The curtains were on a push button system| which was a nice touch| but the buttons were relatively high on the wall| not easily accessible from a chair.,Dec 15| 2019,2
The wallpaper in the halls is falling down and carpets were dirty. Needs renovation badly. Location is excellent.,Dec 15| 2019,3
Absolutely NOT WORTH the star rating - probably will be a 2-3 star for what I can see.  This hotel has been around for ~20+ years.  Price was VERY HIGH for the quality of service you receive. We checked in around 11pm| was quick but lack manners. Upon entering the room| it smelt like sweat.  Horrible| but we were very tired after flying the entire day. Next morning we left for breakfast early and went site seeing. Came back shortly after and saw a housekeeping maid standing outside our room talking on a phone leaning against the wall. The worst thing was what appeared to be fresh clean towels ON THE FLOOR outside our door (see pictures).  What kind of person will put bath / hand towels ON PUBLIC FLOORS!!!!!!! Think about the germs / dirt / fungus etc that's been laying on the public floor and you wipe that onto your body?  Also the bed linens are very course / rough - feels cheap. Check out was bad too. We checked out early. The check out person at the front desk also had bad manners| I gave him the key cards told him my room number. He took the key card| rest by the keyboard and continued to work on other stuff for a minute| w/out saying anything| while looking elsewhere sometime.  No thank you| no nothing. period. First time staying here and will be our last!,Dec 15| 2019,2
We (two women) arrived in NYC at 1:00 am due to a flight delay| and the man at the registration desk said he couldn’t let us check in because I had used my husband’s Hotels.com account to book our stay. I had paid in full using MY credit card| which I had with me and was noted on my paperwork| along with my name. I gave all of this to the clerk| but he said he still couldn’t give us the room as it was against policy and he didn’t want to get in trouble. He was essentially turning us out into the streets| when I had paid in full for your hotel AND had the paperwork to prove it. The clerk told me he needed to talk to my husband| so I got him on the phone for the clerk| but then he still said no| he couldn’t let us check in. Then he said I had to call Expedia because in the computer the reservation was made on Expedia| even though I told him I went through Hotels.com| and showed him my confirmation from them. So| next I spent several more minutes calling Expedia| only for them to tell me that my confirmation number wasn’t from them. Next| the clerk told me to call Hotels.com.| which I did| but then the clerk refused to talk to them| because he said they needed to call your hotel directly. After 45 minutes of this nonsensical runaround| he FINALLY gave us our room.  He said I should have booked directly through the hotel and not with Hotels.com. Our treatment was completely  uncalled for| unprofessiand and unacceptable.,Dec 13| 2019,3
Very good stay and location.  I will stay there again,Dec 11| 2019,4
My favorite affordable NYC hotel. Perfect location.,Dec 10| 2019,5
Everything was great. Enjoyed the happy hour & the breakfast.,Dec 10| 2019,5
Amazing!! I am so glad we picked this hotel.  The location was perfect.,Dec 9| 2019,5
Very convenient if you need to be in midtown.  Onsite restaurants were overpriced.  Service in the quick serve snack area was rude.  Long line at checkout time forced me to leave my room key in the drop box so I'll never know what all those extra charges were for; it's just too much trouble to try to find out several days later.  Lots of extra costs for things other hotels provide gratis| like WIFI in the room.  I thought I had a credit for the informal restaurant but was charged extra for the item I charged to the room.  The so-called deal I got through Expedia wasn't such a good deal once the hidden fees were added up.  Room was quite nice and I can't fault the property as such| it's just a "gimme your money" kind of place| to be expected in midtown Manhattan.,Dec 9| 2019,3
Had to pay "resort fee" (they use another name but basically it is an extra 30$ for High Speed Internet| bar and food drinks voucher). Not happy to have been forced to pay for this when I do not drink alchool and do not wish to have food at the hotel. To further compound the issue| the Internet was not working| not even the "slow speed". In other words| a rip-off.  At check out I said the Internet does not work and the answer was: "yes| we are having problems with it"  No offer to refund| no apologies.,Dec 9| 2019,3
Although we found Hotel very good and prime location the Bar was rather expensive and we were surprised to have to pay for luggage storage for a few hrs at USD $ 5.00 per item|whereas most other Hotels provide this service free.,Dec 9| 2019,3
Hilton nickel & dimed us on top of $400/nt room.,Dec 8| 2019,3
We were not informed before hand of a 30$ a night extra hotel fee.Facility very clean but no coffee machine in room and a hard sell by onsite hilton employees trying to sell time share.,Dec 8| 2019,4
Check in was efficient and the property is always reliable.,Dec 8| 2019,4
Location was great for people looking to do all the tourist things. Hotel was clean| room was a decent size. But amenities and lobby quite basic. Lobby bar not great.,Dec 7| 2019,4
Hotel is beautiful| very comfortable rooms. Bathroom could havw done with a better clean| ans needs updating,Dec 6| 2019,4
Good central location and nice size room which was comfortable. Noisy generators on our side of hotel with a constant background drone| even on 31st floor. Spent an hour in reception and would question security given some of the guests who appeared to be looking to simply get out of the cold and wet| possibly a Hilton approach to CSR. Generally an ok stay but probably won’t be back.,Dec 4| 2019,4
There should be vending machines somewhere on the property| maybe near the lobby. On a cold snowy night the only way to get some food or a bottle of water is to get out of the hotel and walk and try to find a place that is open to get those items.,Dec 4| 2019,5
Great location and spacious room| especially for New York City.,Dec 2| 2019,4
The room was overbooked| took 3 different visits to the front desk to get it sorted| each front desk didn't even pass the proper messages to each other so I had to explain over and over again.  I would never book this hotel| ever again.,Dec 2| 2019,1
We went for the Macy’s day parade no coffee in the room lines were crazy long to get coffee. And the pastries did not seem that fresh nor did they have a name on them.,Dec 2| 2019,4
Great location - walking distance to almost everything and always good service.,Dec 1| 2019,5
Appreciated the early check option and the high parade view of the parade route. Joyland was great! However| the tub needs updating| no chairs in lobby|no coffee pots available and charging to store our luggage for a few hours on check out day is ridiculous.,Dec 1| 2019,3
Great location! Within walking distance to many attractions! On the parade route!,Nov 30| 2019,5
It’s was very clean and customer service was great,Nov 28| 2019,4
Location and staff the property was clean I enjoyed the room layout as wellgreat for young families as well,Nov 26| 2019,5
Very nice overall| but could be a bit cleaner.  The staff is amazing at this location.,Nov 25| 2019,5
So convenient eating and shopping,Nov 23| 2019,5
Great location within walking distance to MoMA| shopping| restaurants. Bedding was super comfortable! I just wish there was a coffee maker in the room.,Nov 21| 2019,4
Good sized rooms| comfortable beds | friendly staff and good quality food on site if required.It is an excellent midtown hotel .,Nov 21| 2019,5
I was expecting more from this property considering it was a Hilton. I know that we booked through Expedia and I feel that this was punished by the hotel staff. The person who checked us in was not friendly. Our safe didn't work and they had to call a locksmith and yes| they finally completed this. Thankfully the worker did give us a credit back to the hotel for the inconvenience. Also we were hit with an unexpected "resort " fee that I felt was covered when we booked with Expedia. I feel that we could have had better service. Positives: the room was clean| it was in a great location and close to highlights of NYC.,Nov 19| 2019,2
The property is showing it’s age. Shower was less than satisfactory. Staff was soulless. The concierge was helpful but dismissive. There was a charge for luggage| total cash grab. Location was great but would not rush to come back here. Overall disappointing.,Nov 19| 2019,4
Excellent property and privilegious location. In the middle of the action of New York.  St Patricks Catedral| Radio City| Rockefeller and Cebrral Park.,Nov 19| 2019,5
Everything was good| except I was put in the handicap room behind the elevator and there was a lot of noise,Nov 18| 2019,4
Location was perfect! Blocks from radio city| Rockefeller center and Central Park. Hotel had a good place to grab food and snacks” Herb n Kitchen”. Plus there is a great gourmet cafe across the street to get drinks and food that’s less expensive then hotel.,Nov 18| 2019,5
Great location! Very centrally located and close to Radio City| MOMA etc.,Nov 18| 2019,5
Location was the best! Room was spacious| friendly helpful staff. Price was good. I would stay again.,Nov 18| 2019,4
It’s weird because it really all boils down to the noise level inside of my room. Outside of the other obvious reasons we choose our hotels| the one primary reason I book a hotel is to get a good nights sleep. With all of the banging| clanking| rushing sound| and other loud noises coming from above my head I could not sleep more than five minutes at a time.,Nov 17| 2019,1
Recently renovated room but bathroom faucet was old and was dislodged from the wall| bathtub was outdated. They also charge $15 to guest for luggage concierge.,Nov 16| 2019,3
We purposely booked a room that was billed as handicap accessible. Unfortunately| the roll-in shower was not properly designed and water flooded the bathroom floor every time we used the shower. We needed to put five or six towels down on the floor every time we use the shower to mop up all the water. The staff was very helpful with bringing  us towels as requested| but in my mind the room was just in adequate for handicap person.This is also the first major hotel that I’ve stayed in that did not have a mini fridge| a coffee maker| robes or room service. Because we were in New York City it was easy to use Seamless for food delivery| but I was disappointed that there was not in House room service available for us. I would not recommend this hotel| and would certainly not stay there again. The only plus was the friendliness of the staff. They were helpful| courteous and professional.,Nov 13| 2019,2
The property was not clean. It's really disappointing for that price. I had a great woman for the check in. Check out was done by a ridiculous man who didn't care about customer... staff need to be improved,Nov 12| 2019,2
Did not like check in. There was only one person at the desk for regular check ins. For the Hilton Honors line there were four people at the desk. Not balanced well so I stood in line for approx. 25 minutes just to get to desk and check in.,Nov 12| 2019,4
Me gusto mucho la ubicación. Esta perfecta.la 6ta avenida. No me gusto que la habitación no tenia nevera. Todo lo demas excelente.,Nov 12| 2019,4
Beds and room small for 4 adults  bathroom  small and old,Nov 12| 2019,2
Great location! Room was a very nice size which in NYC is saying a lot! And the price was less than all the properties around it. I would definitely stay there again. They also gave you $20 to spend in the bar and $10 to spend in the market if you are Hilton Honors and you put it on the room. Hotels are notoriously expensive so these perks made the bill reasonable.,Nov 11| 2019,5
Understaffed - took forever to get car parked and chexkied,Nov 11| 2019,3
Check in & Concierge were great. Luggage holding was a bit more difficult than it needed to be. There were distinct signs of aging when you looked at the walls - wall paper in the halls being visibly damaged| door frames and moldings being more than just nicked. The beds were wonderfully comfortable! :)  The buffet breakfast was $40 - maybe common for NYC| but too much for us. So we went to the grab & go the first morning. Guys were nice| but got a number of details wrong in our order. And the food was certainly not worth the price. We went down the street to the Fresh & CO. on the second morning. While I appreciate the saving of trees| I did not know we would not be getting a paper statement for checkout until we were in the lobby on our way to the taxi. Heads up to look at the bill on the TV would have been nice. Overall - not an unpleasant stay| but not the best Hilton I've been too| either. That said| I'd stay here again if we come back for more shows - the location was PERFECT.,Nov 11| 2019,3
This hotel is well-located and it was convenient that the garage had a charger for electric vehicles. The beds in the room are small| the bathroom configuration is awkward| the sink was clogged| and parts of the room smelled like dirty feet.,Nov 11| 2019,3
Great location. Helpful staff. No coffee maker in room was surprising.,Nov 11| 2019,4
Staff like Kim and shantal were very helpful with me and my friend,Nov 11| 2019,5
The first day it was warm and the ac didn’t work right.  The second night the weather was very cold and the heat didn’t work right,Nov 9| 2019,1
I booked with Expedia a room with a bathtub| however| when I arrived I was told there are no rooms with a bathtub available and that I could ask to be moved the next day. I was given a room with a shower. The room looked old and smelled unpleasantly. The next day I was given a room with a bathtub| which was in much better condition than the first one. We went to the bar to use the hotel credit and we were not the only guests who noticed they were served something else than ordered. All together we consumed less than $60 of the credit we had| so I was told I was ok at the checkout. However| my credit card was charged on the day that I checked out $82.12. Now I am in the process of disputing that charge| that is not mine| through my bank.,Nov 8| 2019,2
Location and size of rooms are hard to beat in Central Park area.  Only downside was the lack of a coffeemaker in my room.  I requested one ahead of my stay but it wasn't provided.,Nov 8| 2019,5
I was suppost to get a room with 2 king sizes brds but| got 2 full sizes beds. This hotel doesn’t have king size beds,Nov 8| 2019,2
They confuse you with all the fees and charges. $25.00 per day Urban Dest fee for example. $325.00 pending fee then $50.00 credit then $231.22 final bill. Just confusing. The hotel| location| staff and amenities are great. Just confusing on how the bill works.,Nov 6| 2019,3
We had great service pre arrival| needing to change some details| the check in staff were friendly and helpful and made us feel welcome. Very good room| great view of Central park and Executive lounge was a great feature and value.,Nov 6| 2019,5
Considering this is NYC| I understand everything is expensive and the most of buildings are old. Pro- good location and mostly walking distance| closer to the central park. Technician was very helpful to fix the room temperature by changing the filterCon- carpet is very old! If not| they must not done cleaning properly. I smell urine when I first opened the door and that first impression was quite strong| but eventually faded away(or I got used to it). Room was very cold| but the problem was solved when technician came over and fixed the thermostat and changed the air filter. There is the open market place and none of food there are tasty and very expensive. When I called for the room service| who would even expect that they will literally bring food from there? Room service food were placed in a container box instead of on the plate..and charged me 1.5 more than buyiny same food on the first floor| open market. The lobby is always a full with people and I had a same impression as Las Vegas.. most hotels in Vegas locates gambling machines in 1st floor and you have to pass by those crowds in order to go to your room.. Hilton Midtown is almost same as the Las Vegas hotels and always with many people in the lobby and of course noise level is quite high.,Nov 4| 2019,3
It was a business trip.  I met up with current and potential clients and this place had it all,Nov 4| 2019,5
Great staff| great hotel| great location in NYC. The  executive suites are large and children are actually welcome in the hotel... not something that you find in all places (such as certain restaurants) in NYC unfortunately.,Nov 3| 2019,5
For the the price| I expected the beds to bed more comfortable and the sheets to be softer not so stiff. The concierge staff need greet all guests respectfully.,Nov 3| 2019,3
Nice Place| great location| but houses keeping is a weak point,Nov 2| 2019,2
Excellent service | attentive staff| great atmosphere.,Nov 1| 2019,5
Great nice and clean hotel!! Loved it,Oct 31| 2019,5
Pretty standard New York Mid Town business hotel. Have stayed here before and will do again.,Oct 29| 2019,5
No water in the rooms. Went to lobby and asked for water,Oct 29| 2019,4
Very friendly staff Love the professional service and the concierge desk.  Very amenable,Oct 28| 2019,5
Great location| friendly staff| nice place to stay.,Oct 27| 2019,4
The checking was without a hitch. Room and amenities were great. You are within walking distance of restaurants and entertainment.,Oct 27| 2019,5
Horrendous check in/ out process. Long lines| no one coming to help anyone but Hilton honors members. Elevators lines were a huge killer as wellBe aware of the resort fees!,Oct 27| 2019,2
Seems a perfect hotel for conferences/conventions.,Oct 25| 2019,5
Central location. Quiet at night| comfortable mattress,Oct 23| 2019,4
Great location. Was not a fan of how dirty the tub was and the bathroom didn’t seem to be as clean in general plus a bit dated. Pillows and bed for a Hilton wee just ok.,Oct 23| 2019,4
Comfortable| convenient to sites we planned to visit| always a bustling lobby,Oct 22| 2019,5
The rooms were nice. Nothing special. I prefer smaller hotels that do not have conferences and such on the premises. Location was great. Our bill was incorrect| which since we did the drop box for check out I did not discover until our credit card bill came. They “offer” $20 a day for the bar and $10 a day for the cafe which is included in the bill regardless of whether you use them or not. So we used them| assured by front desk they would be taken off| but were not. So now I have to spend God only knows how much time trying to get that taken care of. Also| we were confronted one day as we were trying to leave by a very pushy salesman trying to get us to join some Hilton club thing. He would not take no for an answer and kept trying to pressure us until we finally just walked away from him. Not quite the experience you want to have when you have limited time in NY.  Probably will not stay there again...,Oct 17| 2019,3
The only hotel I have ever stayed in that charges for luggage storage - $5 per bag!  Outrageous. 1 star hotels do not charge for that service. It’s a mediocre| convention hotel. Other than a convenient location in Midtown west| there is nothing to recommend this hotel or distinguish it.,Oct 17| 2019,3
great location| easy access. safe walking area any time of day,Oct 16| 2019,5
I was traveling with my 13-year-old daughter. The hotel is  well located and we were able to walk to most of the sites like Top of the Rock| Central Park and Time Square. The metro station was only a block away and was very safe to use. I would definitely recommend staying here.,Oct 16| 2019,5
The size of the room was quite nice for NYC. Also| room was quiet--also surprising. Bed was comfortable| and there was good closet and drawer space.,Oct 13| 2019,3
Many "convenience" fees or "resort" fees for stuff that is grossly over priced and then they give you coupons to reduce the price to less-grossly overpriced... what a deal!  I think you have to deal with this everywhere and until the hidden fee / resort fee lawsuit that is currently ongoing is over... Enjoy your stay!  Nothing particularly good or bad here but the breakfast down the road| either direction| are great and cheaper than the normal cost + resort fees - coupons at the motel.  Total confusion with their bait and switch shell game of fees.  Find a motel that doesn't have all these weird add on fees and you'll be ahead.,Oct 13| 2019,3
Great hotel. Great location. Room was tiny!,Oct 12| 2019,4
The beds are very comfy and bathroom was very nice. The staff isn’t friendly. They have Apple Pay sign on terminals| but when I ask if I could pay with it| the employee told me that I’m not at the subway. Hospitality isn’t a thing there. The plug at the bathroom wasn’t working| and the room was too dark despite being ’a city view’ on the 21st floor. The hotel has a great location| and it's perfect for sleeping if you're lucky with neighbors (many rooms are adjusted rooms).,Oct 12| 2019,3
Comfortable and clean. Great service.,Oct 12| 2019,5
Great location and room was clean and a good size.Room was missing a fridge which was inconvenient and it took a number of phone calls to get a fourth towel to our room (only supplied with 3 for some reason despite registering with 4 guests).,Oct 11| 2019,4
Beds very comfotable and soft pillowsBreakfast buffet was excellent lots of chouces and freshResirt tax was not desirable so we ensured that we used up the credits by eating in the bar lounge and buying bottles of water from take away each day,Oct 10| 2019,4
Nice hotel in all aspects and great location for event.,Oct 9| 2019,5
Good sized rooms|great location and good for a relaxing drink on a night and in the evening.,Oct 9| 2019,5
Had a room with 2 doubles and 3 people.  Rooms are large enough to have queen beds| the double beds are too small.The breakfast buffet| while delicious and accessible for those of us with allergies was $140 for 3 people (no alcohol)Liked the black out curtains but the surge protector gave off a pretty bright night light| totally defeating the purpose of the black out curtains!,Oct 8| 2019,4
Fabulous location and property. However this hotel is used by at least one cruise ship per day causing long lines and extensive crowding at many times.,Oct 8| 2019,4
great location| excellent amenities in hotel...my only negative would be the $30 a day they lock you in to paying up front| to be credited back to you only if you use it at their food market and bars...seems a bit heavy handed to get you to spend more $$ at their facilities...,Oct 7| 2019,4
Really nice hotel | fun bar downstairs as well as restaurant,Oct 7| 2019,5
Easy check in clean with friendly staff great location,Oct 6| 2019,4
Great front desk| event if they did not have what I asked for.Overall hotel great if you like Las Vegas style size!Need some design update| 80’s are over:)Not my kind of place| but everyone was great!,Oct 5| 2019,4
Very old and dirty hotel. Smells bad| bathroom very poor. Good location,Oct 5| 2019,1
Great location| well laid out and comfortable room.   Staff also top notch.,Oct 3| 2019,5
No only was there no coffee machine and no fridge in our room| although there was clearly a large spot of unusable cabinet space where it used to be| but an item went missing from our room. Security was kind and the only redeeming staff member we met. My husband sent flowers that that never delivered to our room. We only found out flowers had been sent at checkout - when they asked if we ever received the flowers. The staff was indifferent and far from sympathetic that our stay was so terrible and that their service was so disappointing. I recommend picking a Marriott option over the Hilton Midtown.,Oct 1| 2019,1
Thanks,Sep 30| 2019,5
Bathroom sink and floor had large cracks.  Needs major renovation.,Sep 30| 2019,2
Love the location of the hotel.. subway is close by  so you can disperse wherever you want .. so accesible location . Be aware no parking,Sep 26| 2019,4
Very central to everything...loved coffee shop inside lobby along with food options there...nice view of the city,Sep 25| 2019,5
Horrible service and staff. Didn’t assist with any questions,Sep 25| 2019,1
The location is perfect! Very good and clean rooms.,Sep 25| 2019,4
I really like a hotel with a pool and it' s been very warm in New York since our arrival.  For the cost of the hotel it's just a basic room| not even a coffee maker is provided.  The location is great but it's nothing special.  I likely won't stay here again.,Sep 24| 2019,3
Their air conditioner needs an upgrade. It was humid in the room.,Sep 23| 2019,4
The room was way over priced for what we paid for.The view was not of the city| The worst part we could not change the temp. in the room it was very cold. we were told the temp could not be changed till the hotel decided it was time.,Sep 21| 2019,2
The walls on the hallways are full of scratches| the paint on them is coming off too| and i was only on my floor the whole time| i didn't even get to see the rest of the floors. But great service| great hospitality and fast response. Very warm welcome also| thank u for everything.,Sep 21| 2019,5
Hotel looks like old..so a little bit dirty in bath.But good place to get to Time square and mid town :)Be careful!! About Mandatory fees USD 50.00 per night!!!! when you making a reservation. Nodody tell me when I check in.And I heard many people didn’t know it before checking out..I felt so bad because I couldn’t use hotel credit before check out..but must payI know many hotels have same way to add fee but tell visitors when they check in.,Sep 18| 2019,2
It was in midtown and close to Times Square.  Lots of food and entertainment in the area. It was close to public transportation. My 2 bed room was very spacious.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to others.,Sep 18| 2019,5
One of our favorite places to stay when in NY. Centrally located to Time Square and Central Park,Sep 17| 2019,5
Central location was about all that this property had going for it. Very disappointed with the service and overall quality of the hotel. The tv kept cutting in and out of service in our room. Was pestered constantly about signing up for a time share. “Resort fee” for no additional amenities which seemed absurd.,Sep 17| 2019,2
The room was clean| The breakfast service was great.  Had a great time.  Would recommend the Hotel to a friend or relative.  I would go again to this Hotel.,Sep 16| 2019,5
I thought that the drinks were quite costly in the bar| but the staff was so extremely friendly and helpful| room was extremely clean and housekeeping staff kept it clean daily.,Sep 16| 2019,5
Great location and great staff... I also used the business center which was great...,Sep 15| 2019,4
good location; basic but clean and well maintained. Be aware of the extra hotel fees,Sep 14| 2019,4
We had the most unpleasant experience compared to other hotels we have stayed in New York| we had to change rooms three times during a 5 night stay because of hotel mistakes and because unprogrammed maintenance| we felt the rooms were dusty| one out of three elevators to our floor didn't work| and the fornt desk staff's servis was poor.  We received a one night refund in compensation for the inconveniences| I guess it is fair enough.,Sep 13| 2019,2
Staff was unfriendly and not helpful!The location is great!,Sep 13| 2019,4
The hotel was in a central location close to all attractions NYC has to offer. However there are no coffee makers in the rooms and the restaurant within the hotel always had a line for coffee. Starbucks was right across to the street so I made my way over there every morning which was so inconvenient.,Sep 13| 2019,4
The staffs at the cafe need to be more proactive. We wait in the line 25 min.,Sep 11| 2019,5
We got stung with a $30 a day charge for internet| I had asked about free WiFi for the room with my Hilton honours number| the girl on reception handed me scarf with a WiFi code on one side. I didn’t read the other side which told of a urban amenities charge!!!,Sep 11| 2019,2
Very clean and great location. Exceptional service.,Sep 10| 2019,5
Location was perfect and all staff’s customer shrives were perfect! I’ve got good impression to experience this hotel! Everything was good ! One thing that bath tile and bath were not enough to clean. I wish it could be more clean but it was fine ;)  i never use the resort fee with other hotel| but they gave good offer to use the resort fee! Even i couldn’t use all but it was helpful to stay in this hotel ! Thanks for all good experience;),Sep 10| 2019,5
New York Hilton Midtown is a large| but consequently impersonal hotel. It’s facilities and location cannot be questioned. We have stayed there several times and standards have always been maintained.,Sep 10| 2019,4
It was clean.  There were problems with elevators which meant we had to wait a bit longer than planned.  Also| it would be nice to have complementary water or coffee to available in the rooms such as what is offered with other chains like Marriott,Sep 10| 2019,4
Great weekend with my wife.  We enjoyed the stay.  The room was clean and tidy.  No disappointments whatsoever.   I would recommend to a friend.,Sep 10| 2019,4
Not 1 complaint Great hotel very accommodating  !,Sep 9| 2019,5
Great location. Enjoyed the Herb’n Kitchen| though they were a bit understaffed in the Grab n Go area.,Sep 9| 2019,5
Poor customer service| no smile on face This was my first time staying in Hilton| not a good experience Very Disappointed ☹️,Sep 9| 2019,3
I liked how it was close to a lot of things in the middle of the city. I think the elevators were an issue since it took a long time to get one and they were usually crammed. Also I recommend letting guests know they get a $30 credit to their room every day.,Sep 9| 2019,4
The access from the hotel to the famous places are very good.,Sep 8| 2019,4
We called ahead asking about an early check in. We were told that it would depend on their availability. When we arrived the front desk told us they had a room available but would charge an early check-in fee of $175 ( a full night stay). It was a shocker. Needless to say we waited...Also| computers in their business center did not work for a simplest task of printing boarding passes. In their zeal to disable everything possible to drive people to pay they disabled the only function a computer was supposed be free for.,Sep 7| 2019,3
Housekeeping was horrible and there was a level of wear and dirt on the linens that just made me uncomfortable.  Specifically stains on the towels that had not been washed out (and felt super abrassive by the way).  Also my bed not being fully made (sheets tucked on one but not on the other) just made things feel haphazard and didn't give me any confidence in how comprehensive a cleaning this room got before I got it.,Sep 6| 2019,2
The rooms need updating. I was I’ll during my visit and since they had no room service| I ordered UberEats. They wouldn’t let the delivery person to come to my room and I had to go to the lobby to retrieve my food. The A/C’s are old and the noise did not help while I was trying to recover.,Sep 5| 2019,3
Hotel was very nice| clean and comfortable. I rated service at neutral since it took 3 tries to get into the room we reserved. There was a couple right across the hall from us that were fighting and yelling in there room and up and down the hall until 2:30 a.m. when I finally went out and told them to knock it off. Not the hotel’s fault since I didn’t call the front desk about it.,Sep 4| 2019,4
Close to everything walking distance. Nice big open lobby area,Sep 4| 2019,5
Liked: locationDisleked: no personel to make you feel welcome at entries| across the lobby area,Sep 4| 2019,4
Location was perfect. Request for quiet room for the baby’s sleep was well accommodated.,Sep 4| 2019,5
Good location. Breakfast is always a nice inclusion| but they did not have it.,Sep 4| 2019,3
Muy buen ubicado en el centro de la ciudad| fácil acceso a monumentos| excelente vista,Sep 3| 2019,4
Great location and Hotel. Close to shopping . Safe location.Always stay here .,Sep 3| 2019,5
Amazing hotel in great location. However| parking for two nights was $170 which beats all parking records.  Just sayin..,Sep 2| 2019,4
Upon our arrival to the room| we found the last guest’s dirty socks hanging in the lamps and it was obvious the room hadn’t been cleaned at all. This was a lackluster stay to say the least| and we certainly did not expect such poor conditions at any Hilton. Highly disappointed all the way around. It felt like a Motel 8| except for the lobby area. I would suggest looking elsewhere if traveling with a family.,Sep 2| 2019,2
My room did not have a small refrigerator. It would have been very useful for any food brought back to my room,Sep 1| 2019,4
Centralized| good location| good staff| near to a lot of business areas and restaurants.,Aug 31| 2019,4
Stay was just ok.  The staff not very friendly or helpful.  The bathroom wallpaper was peeling and the door knob in bathroom kept falling off.,Aug 31| 2019,3
New York Hilton is the destination full service hotel in midtown for a reasonable price.,Aug 30| 2019,5
Great hotel and location. Everyone professional . Great shopping!,Aug 30| 2019,5
The Hilton Midtown is a fantastic facility in just the right location. Super comfortable rooms and amenities.,Aug 29| 2019,5
The room we are in is small and not comfortable | don’t wait and say something I learned my lesson,Aug 28| 2019,1
Perfect location. Did not like the mandatory $30 fee (even with the inclusions),Aug 28| 2019,4
The staff were friendly and had a good sense of humour. They were always willing to help with whatever we needed. The room was big for NY standards and clean. It was great having the Herb n kitchen in the hotel as we could get fresh fruit or snacks or meals whenever we wanted. I would definitely stay here again.,Aug 28| 2019,4
Property is nice and well located| but you’ll be nickel and dimed for breathing. And don’t even think about asking questions at the front desk—I actually said at one point| “well| we’ll just keep trying until we get someone who’s nice enough to talk to us.” Not all staff are unkind| but it was enough of a pattern that it made paying a premium price for everything very hard to swallow.,Aug 27| 2019,2
Like : location and pets friendlyDislike : Room and bathroom : noisy| stinky and outdated. No mini bar| no room service. Reception : awful staff. I've never been into jail but the welcome must be the same,Aug 27| 2019,1
The room was small| but had everything I needed| including a minifridge and blow dryer.,Aug 26| 2019,4
Great location| but the hotel itself has seen better days. Initially| I was on the 39th floor| next to the elevator shaft| and the high speed elevators sounded too much like airplanes taking off| so I asked to be switched to another room. My new room on the 14th floor was also next to the elevator shaft| but the noise level was normal. However| that floor is in an older part of the hotel that hasn't been renovated| and some of the lights didn't work. Worst of all| no refrigerator| and when they brought me one| it stank because someone had left food in it and it hadn't been properly cleaned. The smell was oozing out and filled the room even with the frig door shut. So my question is: Why would Housekeeping send me something like that? I had them take it away and then spent two hours airing out my room.,Aug 26| 2019,3
Is very close to everything  like times square and central park,Aug 26| 2019,4
Location is spectacular--can walk to so many NYC attractions. Staff was very friendly| helpful| and quick to respond to requests. Our room (king + sofabed) was very large for an NYC hotel. Very clean and quiet. Will definitely book this one again.,Aug 26| 2019,5
The upper floors need a refresh-in particular the hallways. We noticed a dead mouse in the hall on the way to our rooms.,Aug 26| 2019,2
Great location. Good room. Only downside| i got the urban room with a queen bed. Room was significantly smaller than it appeared in the pictures,Aug 25| 2019,4
Check in had extra fees that were rudely explained. The female bartender was incredible and very friendly. There was no fitted sheet on the bed so the regular sheet kept moving meaning that I was touching the yucky mattress pad most of the night. Check out was supposed to be at 12:00 and a staff member let him/herself into our room at 9:15 and woke us up. Good sized room. Cheap toilet paper. Fast Wifi.,Aug 24| 2019,2
Nice hotel but stuff never explains anything and room was an clean,Aug 23| 2019,1
Well it started off not so great by us getting a room that was already being occupied. Someone's belongings were in the room and the room was not fully cleaned. At first the hotel wanted to grab the persons items and have us keep the room. No! We need another room. Due to having the room issue my friend and I missed our event. Other than offering a new room the hotel did nothing for us. I'm not one to cause a scene or overreact when this type of thing happens. But something woild've been nice. We could not get a refund for our event because it was too close to the time for the event and 24 hours is needed. If we knew beforehand we would miss the activity we would've canceled. There's $52 we didn't and won't get back. Other than that the staff is very nice and professional. The hotel and new room we stayed in was very nice. They kept it clean.,Aug 23| 2019,4
Very clean room good price very comfortable beds very friendly staff,Aug 23| 2019,4
Nothing| the people are rude| the room smells| there are bugs and I can't wait to leave.,Aug 23| 2019,1
The lights in the room are cheap and the bulbs too bright. The water pressure is ok| but not great.The bigger issue is that I made 2 separate bookings as I initially was staying 1 night| but changed to 2.After attending meetings all day| I come back at 9:30pm to find my room had not been serviced. Very disappointing,Aug 22| 2019,4
I am stay at 6 flor I really disappointed employee cleaning room we have one employee really really rude| my second time I am stay this hotel but I never stay again,Aug 21| 2019,2
Start off on the bad side my room wasn’t ready had to get another room for the first night then switched rooms in the morning other than that everything went well.,Aug 21| 2019,4
This hotel has a great location. The rooms were quite large for NYC. The staff was friendly| for instance they were quick to replace the dead batteries in our thermostat. The lobby of the hotel is a little boring and the check in was glacial. It took about an hour to check in since they had one person working on a Saturday afternoon. Really need to fix that. OTOH| the rest of the stay was quite pleasant. Would definitely stay here again. Good value for NYC.,Aug 20| 2019,4
I didn't like the surprise fees I had to pay on top of the rate of staying 2 nights for $543 and then ordered 4 cheeseburger platters and a beer for $171.00.  I think it is ridiculously high priced and it is not that good.  I will be staying at a bed and breakfast next time to save money.  It is unfair to tourists have to pay that kind of money to visit a place.,Aug 19| 2019,4
It took 1 hour in the line up to check-in. The room that we had booked was not available resulting in one of us having to sleep on the floor the 1st night. So| the booking/registration process was suboptimal. Good otherwise,Aug 19| 2019,3
Rooms were a bit dated and cramped| but pretty typical of affordable hotels in Midtown. The wireless| however| was terrible; I repeatedly lost connection in both my room and in meeting areas.,Aug 18| 2019,3
I expected more from Hilton New York... needs renovation.,Aug 18| 2019,2
no good food later in the evening| need to go out of hotel,Aug 17| 2019,5
Very good customer services. I left my dress in the closet and called them when I was back home. Staff at lost and found is very helpful and send my dress to my home right away.,Aug 16| 2019,5
location was great| but amenities were very poor; no coffee machine| no refrigerator| old towels!  dust everywhere in the room! guest services was not friendly.,Aug 16| 2019,2
There is no unique property. But breakfast was very good.,Aug 15| 2019,3
Great location and good rooms. Prompt customer service,Aug 14| 2019,5
A great stay in NYC. Fabulous location| excellent service| huge room for NYC! We arrived early on check in day and were able to get right in to our room. I had booked one king bed and the gentleman that checked us in asked if we’d prefer two beds- which we did. The room was spacious| clean| and nicely updated. The TV was huge! Housekeepers super friendly and always saying hi and smiling. Only complaint- the WiFi was weird. I kept getting kicked off even after entering the password. Herb and kitchen (grab and go cafe) had just about anything you could need! Snacks| drinks| hot food| etc etc. Would definitely come back to this hotel next time I travel to NYC!,Aug 14| 2019,5
I have never stayed at Hilton properties before| but this definitely was my last time. I have no complains about service and people that work there. However| the rooms and the overall hotel condition is not what I expected completely for a 4 star hotel. Paint is chipping off| furniture is beat up| surfaces (including windows) weren’t cleaned and had food remains from previous occupants.,Aug 13| 2019,2
Excellent everything | the rooms are clean and  comfortable,Aug 13| 2019,5
Old towels| only 2 towels in the room. No coffee maker in the room.45 min wait to check in.,Aug 13| 2019,2
We were assigned to a very old room without fridge and the couch was very dirty because they want to sell all their rooms. After our complaints and with assistance from the very helpful “bell man”| they arranged another room to us with better conditions.,Aug 11| 2019,2
Customer service was great !!!!! But than we arrived in the room and it smelled like a basement. Also we had a room for 6 and there were only 3 towels. We had no cups/glasses. So besides the room our stay was great| the location was awesome!!!!,Aug 6| 2019,2
Great location and exactly what you expect -no surprises!,Aug 5| 2019,5
Great location| walking distance to Radio City| Rockefeller| Time Square and Subway Stations. Rooms are roomy and clean,Aug 4| 2019,4
The Midtown Hilton is in a perfect location!  Walking distance to Central Park| Rockefeller Center| Time Square| museums| theaters and Broadway.  It’s accommodations are wonderful and staff incredible!   I’ve stayed numerous times and would definitely recommend it as a great place to stay in NY!,Aug 4| 2019,5
Excellent hotel - elegant and clean. Amazing breakfast. Centrally located. Parking is expensive| though. Not a problem if you don't have a car| but we had one.,Aug 2| 2019,5
Yes| it’s big but it’s also very well run with lots of staff. Lobby bustles with people coming and going but after a few days i could see it was well managed. Room was comfortable| fresh| quiet and housekeeping was impeccable. You can’t beat the location and the price is what you will pay for run down hotels . Because it’s a large hotel| you can usually snag a room or two even at last minute.,Aug 2| 2019,5
Friendly despite being an enormous hotel. Expensive like the rest of Manhattan. Breakfast great but again so expensive. Very busy hotel. Public areas often crowded with business meeting clients.,Aug 2| 2019,5
The furniture ( couch) was dirty real bad asked them several time didn’t care they keep saying sorry they be there to clean it never showed up but they collect my money I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone one I been Hilton honer for over 17 years this the worst service I have ever received.I’m business owner I can’t describe my disappointment.,Aug 1| 2019,1
Would wish if coffee machine and paper cups are provided.,Jul 30| 2019,4
The service was so terrible| the room is run down and all together we will not be ever staying at another Hilton hotel,Jul 30| 2019,1
Good hotel. Very central and within walking distance.Good breakfast choices but we found Herb n Kitchen to be very expensive.,Jul 29| 2019,4
Overall this property was just OK. Unfortunately| the rates for the parking is inaccurate online vs. once on-site. We were able to check in earlier than 3pm with no additional fees which was great! However| we found stained towels and the pull out sofa was disgusting!!!! Needless to say no one slept on it. The location was amazing but that’s all I can really rate.,Jul 29| 2019,2
My client accidentally double-booked directly with Hilton day of the event and Hilton charged them and me for the hotels.com reservation for the same day. It is impossible to get through to their billing department and their customer success team is a mess. Alyssa Vanhaastern who is supposed to be a director was rude| unprofessional| and a waste of time to speak to.,Jul 26| 2019,1
The situation of the hotel. It is in the perfect place. The money that you have to pay at the hotel.,Jul 25| 2019,4
Very nice hotel| parking fees are outrageous but other than that enjoyed our stay,Jul 24| 2019,5
Nothing special or outstanding.  Failed to inform me about $30/daily “resort fee” and didn’t get the free drink.,Jul 23| 2019,3
The staff was behaving like we bother them,Jul 22| 2019,3
Elevators didn’t work the majority of our stay... the whole place was freezing (overcompensating for the outside temps). Too expensive for the room we got and parking was $100 for 24 hours.....,Jul 22| 2019,3
PROS1. We had corner room #808 and the view was nice2. Room was clean w/o any bugsCONS1. Check in/out lines were always crowded and took too long. There were not enough desk clerks.  Same issue with long lines at the hotels cafe "Urban Kitchen."2. MAJOR ISSUE was the rooms are not equipped with a coffee maker or microwave oven. At the price and type of hotel this is| these should be standard equipment. Hotel should also provide free coffee in the lobby.3. City lost electrical power the first day of our stay and it caused havoc with the elevators knocking many out of commission all week long. This caused major elevator overcrowding and long wait times to catch one4. Bathroom was small with sink so close to the toilet.5. Bathroom sink had sharp corners and we kept impaling ourselves on it when using the toilet6. Bathroom sink design was not very good as water did not drain off it's top into the bowl but rather leaves a lot of standing water7. Shower stall has peeling paint on the ceiling and some spots of mildew in the tub caulking8. Blackout curtains need a vertical section installed on one end to prevent light from coming in9. Room cabinet that holds the safe and refrigerator has a lot of water damage on top of it and needs to be replaced10. Had to relog into WiFi every single day,Jul 21| 2019,3
Hilton is generally a reliable hotel.  The Hilton in NYC is not a good choice if senior citizen.   Lobby very noisy.   When I was there a bus load of teenagers.   One person doing regular checkin.  I waited in line for over ONE hour.   No place for me to sit.   Other than that clean hotel. Good location.,Jul 21| 2019,3
Didn’t like having to pay 30.00 extra per night for credit to bar and eating place,Jul 21| 2019,4
Very nice property. Reasonable price for midtown NYC. Valet parking was efficient. All staff very pleasant. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was included in my stay and there was a wide selection to choose from. Unfortunately we were there during a power blackout so did but have a chance to enjoy the hotel bar the evening of our stay. Plan to return.,Jul 20| 2019,5
Very hectic in the lobby and many people not staying at the hotel milling around,Jul 20| 2019,5
Staff in dining/ breakfast area super friendly!!! Awesome service Check in waaay too long and front desk staff not friendly,Jul 20| 2019,4
There is nothing wrong or unique about this property.  The room was large but the bathroom was small.  No coffee maker in the room but we did have a mini fridge.  We went to the buffet bit and it was average.  Food is way overpriced but not unusual for a hotel in the city.  It is a huge place and very busy.  We were there for a convention and it is clear that the hotel is geared towards this.,Jul 19| 2019,3
The check in and check out was an extremely long line even for the Hilton Rewards customers. There were only three people total behind the desk| which wasn’t enough.,Jul 18| 2019,4
They said they would call me when our room was ready| they did not. It took about an hour to check in at midnight after we returned from a Yankees game because we were not notified that our room was ready.,Jul 18| 2019,3
Front desk made check in very difficult. Didn't help at all or act nicely when name on room was different than my name| despite having the credit card and the room ALREADY BEING PAID FOR. Left a bad taste in my mouth.,Jul 17| 2019,3
Black out for hours when power was restored elevators were not working and we were told that no stairs were available just a nightmare,Jul 16| 2019,1
Bellhop service still has a lot room to improve| specifically the manner to communicate with guests when it is busy and lack of manpower| especially for the bellhop service manager.Everything else all met our expectations| even though we encountered the blackout.,Jul 16| 2019,4
I checked in at 12:15am then had to wait 45 minutes for a room to get cleaned !!,Jul 16| 2019,1
Power outage in hotel. No refund was given. No contact by hotel was made afterwards to us as guests.,Jul 16| 2019,1
First| you can see the light under the connecting door. Shameful! Second| you can hear your neighbors! Shameful.  The amenities are limited.  A cost of a simple  bottle of water and a protein bar should not cost nearly $10.00!!  It is pretty apparent the prices in this hotel are overly inflated. I can’t wait to leave.,Jul 16| 2019,2
room and bathroom were old| water in shower not even close to hot| sheets and covers covered with boogers (gross| hic!).,Jul 15| 2019,3
BIG HOTEL WITH OUT EMERGENCY POWER. MY KID HAD A CAST IN THE RIGHT LEG| I USED A PROSTESIS IMAGINE HAVING TO GO TO THE 20TH FLOOR| NO AIR| NO WATER...... WHENT TO ANOTHER HOTEL FOR THE NIGHT.,Jul 15| 2019,2
We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel.  Everything about the hotel was really nice and the location was great.  When we stayed here| there was a massive blackout and all the electricity was off in the building and surrounding areas for about 5 hours.  My 7-year-old daughter was frightened by this and started crying at one point.  One of the managers saw her and reassured her that everything was okay and that the electricity would be on soon.  He took her into the hotel store| that had to close because of the outage| and let her pick out some candy.  He was very busy during this time and didn't have to spend the time to comfort her but it seemed like a top priority to him then.  I appreciate any time someone goes above and beyond for their customers and he certainly did.,Jul 15| 2019,5
The staff were extremely polite| respectful| and friendly.  The hot food take out kitchen was so convenient| as it was open until midnight.  The facility is clean| and in an excellent location.,Jul 15| 2019,5
great location| you can walk to the central park. clean and comfortable room.,Jul 15| 2019,4
There was No swiming pool. The children were looking forward to a swim.,Jul 13| 2019,4
Great location. Breakfast phenomenal!! Rooms clean,Jul 13| 2019,5
As always| a very good stay. Keep up the good work!,Jul 13| 2019,4
Great location| nice rooms| friendly staff. The luggage storage is a bit of a walk from the check in area| and for a 4 star hotel I was a bit surprised our bags weren’t taken care of and brought to the room once it was ready for us. The breakfast buffet is nice| and check out was easy. Overall a good hotel| but the services offered could be spruced up| especially for the cost.,Jul 13| 2019,4
Didn’t like the 30.00 charge on the room each night for snacks and food. Basically we were forced to purchase food we didn’t want,Jul 13| 2019,5
very noisy ventilation system running 24 hours a day,Jul 11| 2019,4
The stay was nice if only they could get the elevators to work properly going to the upper floors.  Waiting 20 minutes for an elevator and having the staff finally take you down the service elevator is not ideal.,Jul 11| 2019,3
The hotelLobby is clean.the beds were comfortable. It didn’t provide room slippers and I would have liked one to use. The shower drain was an issue and had to call maintenance for repair twice during the time I stayed. The bar gave free nuts when ordering and it was good. Overall| a good experience.,Jul 11| 2019,4
great location| clean and friendly staff. Good place to stay with kids!,Jul 10| 2019,5
Huge hotel but restaurant options within are mediocre at best. Basic room was decent size for being in Manhattan. Bed mattress was firm and pillows were uncomfortable. Window didn’t close properly causing the wind to whistle through along with the city noise. Hotel staff were decent but definitely didn’t rise to the level of providing premier service.,Jul 9| 2019,4
Amazing location! Within walking distance to so many places!,Jul 8| 2019,5
Great location. Staff was friendly. We were only given two towels each night even though the room was booked for four people. Just a minor inconvenience having to ask for extra towels each night,Jul 8| 2019,4

Loved the location and the proximity to all the sites.,Jul 3| 2019,5
Our stay at the Hilton Midtown was great. Everyone was very friendly| helpful and accommodating. We were met with smiles all around. When the concierge found out it was my daughter’s 25th birthday she had a bottle of wine and dessert sent to her room. My husband and I want to go back for our anniversary. It’s a great location. Only thing I was a little disappointed in was the view from our room.,Jul 2| 2019,5
Very spacious rooms| nice lobby area was nice and large and hotel is located in a great location.,Jul 1| 2019,5
Dirty. Ice bucket had maxi pads in it.  I called and requested a new bucket and someone came to the door and dumped out the pads and just put in a new liner. Gross,Jul 1| 2019,1
The room was spacious| very nice| the lobby was entertaining and wonderful| entrance was very beautiful and elegant. What I didn't like was the bathroom towel was dirty| I found brown stains on the new folded towel so I had to call housekeeping for new ones| the phone didn't work properly to contact the front desk so I used my cell phone| the check in front desk was very busy and crowded| took a very long time to both check in and check out of the hotel| wasn't very satisfied. The hotel location was great.,Jul 1| 2019,4

It was very convenient and centrally locates. Staff was friendly,Jul 1| 2019,5
We found this hotel at 3:00am since we were left stranded at our original hotel booking with lack of air conditioning.  Thanks to Mouctar at the front desk| he accommodated us and made the start of our trip better than it originally began.,Jul 1| 2019,5
Great view great place Great location Great staff,Jul 1| 2019,5
The location was excellent. The room was comfortable and clean although it smelled a little like cigarettes.,Jul 1| 2019,4
It had excellent location. It was clean and staff were helpful.,Jul 1| 2019,5
The property was excellent and had every amenity.  The only thing I did not like was the presence and calls of sales people in the lobby who pretend to want to  give you something (most likely for your time at some kind of presentation).,Jun 30| 2019,5
We were told the room would be ready at 3 o’clock it never got into our room till 730 maids didn’t clean up into about 630 7 o’clock at night other than that it was OK,Jun 29| 2019,2
Hotel was short staffed in seemingly every area.  It took 6 calls to the front desk to get an answer.  I was surprised a Hilton property would be disorganized and lack customer focus| especially in NY where service is king.  Would not stay again,Jun 28| 2019,3
Horrible experience| the area has a tremendous amount of construction. I couldn't get to the hotel at all in my rental car. Only road was completely closed.  Then I called the front desk and they said to keep trying. I had to drive over a sidewalk and go the wrong way on a one way street. COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.  I had my daughter asleep in the car at 11:30 at night since I was circling for an hour trying to figure out how to get in.,Jun 28| 2019,1
It was a really nice hotel! My family and I really enjoyed our stay!,Jun 27| 2019,5

They did not let me check in | said there is no room then move me to another hotel.,Jun 24| 2019,1
No coffee or bottled water in the rooms.   Other than that everything was excellent.,Jun 24| 2019,4
Half hour to check in. Under staffed and could not handle demand,Jun 23| 2019,2
Convenient location. When we first got to our room the trash can had not been emptied and there was a lot of hair on the bathroom floor and in the bathtub. Only 1 place to buy coffee in the hotel in the morning therefore the line was long. No coffee maker in room.,Jun 22| 2019,3
We loved the Midtown Hilton! Staff was so nice| great service| clean| safe| wonderful breakfast| very accommodating| clean.  We loved the location.,Jun 22| 2019,5
This hotel is at an awesome location - so close to Central Park| Radio City| Rockefeller| Times Square! Clean rooms| very attentive staff. If you book an executive suite it comes with the executive lounge which includes breakfast and other executive lounge privileges| like cookies & bottled water.  This was perfect for our family of 6. Saved us so much time each morning not having to worry about going somewhere for breakfast. We will definitely return!,Jun 20| 2019,5
Awesome facility and location!!  Bob at the front desk was very nice!!,Jun 18| 2019,5
The only thing I wasn’t pleased about was the nightly drilling construction work that occurred around there every night I was there. Also| the shower curtain had a muggy smell to it.,Jun 18| 2019,3
I personally would not book here again. This has to be by far the worst Hilton I have ever been to.,Jun 17| 2019,2
The staff was not forthcoming with pricing.   From the food to the parking the staff made it appear every thing was taken care of upon check in.   Imagine my surprise when the staff stated we had to put down $150 deposit and the only money returned was $34.    During our stay we “received a food credit”.   The only food we had at your restaurant was  1 cup of coffee| a croissant  and a bagel.   Upon getting our car we were given a bill for $140.   I do not appreciate being what it amounts to is lied to.,Jun 15| 2019,2
Center of everything. Good point to go to everything,Jun 12| 2019,5
Clean rooms| beds| and hallways.  Elevators work fast and food was good.,Jun 11| 2019,5
Very Dusty room ( the AC / heater unit probably needs a new filter)| sticky carpet| not very nice employers.Big disappointment for the price!The only good thing about was the location.,Jun 10| 2019,2
Great location in Manhattan. Very nice staff. Very expensive for water inside the hotel though. $9 for a 32 ounce bottle of water at Herbs cafe. Gio who worked at front desk was extremely helpful with accommodations and keeping us in same room. I would certainly return to this hotel.,Jun 9| 2019,5
Breakfast was excellent value. Considerable choice for both hot/cold breakfast. $48 for American breakfast (hot &cold) choices or £28 for cold breakfast.One downside is the $30 daily charge for on-site amenities  etc.| whether you use them or not.,Jun 8| 2019,4
The property was clean and safe. The staff was very friendly!,Jun 8| 2019,4
Nice room. Place to hold bags. Large breakfast buffet. Didn’t tell us at check in that we had $30 to spend at Herb and Dine until we were ready to check out.,Jun 8| 2019,5
Everything Was great except the 1st night. When I checked in at 4:30PM they said they were sold out of rooms and only put me in a room that was the size of a closet. I prepaid $2500 6 weeks ago. Why wasn’t a room held for me. I stayed there many times and have always been pleased. I had to move the next afternoon which messed up my day. Pack and unpack double times. Many people I noticed checked after me and they seemed to get their rooms.,Jun 7| 2019,4
Great location for movement throughout manhattan and surrounding areas.,Jun 6| 2019,5
I knew this was a convention type hotel upon booking so was not surprised by the masses of people in the lobby.  Upon checkin| the receptionist offered me the executive lounge for an extra $50.00 per night for the 2 rooms we had.  I agreed| thinking this would be similar to executive lounges in Asia.  Wrong.They had wine and beer| but there was a $5.00 charge.  They ran out of bottled water on at least 2 occasions in 4 nights.  The snacks served for happy hour were pathetic.  The buffet breakfast was basically just bread.  The coffee was OK.  All in all a huge ripoff for $50.00.  I was on the 33rd floor which was serviced by 3 elevators for about 10 floors.  One was out of service.  The wait for the elevator was usually pretty long and you got stuffed in with a bunch of strangers.  I guess Americans don't expect much and hence they don't get much.  All in all| a pathetic hotel| although the room was OK.  The bed was comfortable| but there was only 1 sink and that was in the tiny bathroom.  It's nice to have another sink so 2 people can actually get ready at the same time.  We were given 2 quite cheap bath towels| no robes.  These are just the facts.  As long as the hotel is almost fully booked they will rip off as many people as possible,Jun 4| 2019,2
My family and I had a wonderful experience in New York City.  The Hilton Midtown was amazing| close to all the major areas and safe and secure.  I want to say thank you to Joyland who was at reception.  She went above and beyond to make me and my family feel at home| she ensured we were taken care of| gave us an excellent room and was very fun and friendly.  I would go back to this hotel just for her| thank you Joyland for your friendly and kind service| and Go Raptors!,Jun 4| 2019,5
Liked: The staff were hugely helpful| the Herb & Kitchen downstairs was welcoming| friendly and offered lovely choice| the room was of more than adequate size and cleanliness.Didn't like: the shower was continually cold at around 6pm when we wanted to freshen up before heading out for the evening. We were also unsure why there was a Conserve to Preserve policy that wasn't followed by cleaners - we received fresh towels and bed linen daily| which is lovely but not entirely necessary. The price of a glass of wine at the bar was eye-watering!,Jun 4| 2019,4
Great location and within walking distance to Times Square. Nice spacious rooms.,Jun 4| 2019,5
Liked location| didn’t like no fan in the bathroom,Jun 3| 2019,4
Great hotel but there is no coffee in the room and room service does not start until 6:30 and they will not let you pre-order,Jun 3| 2019,3
Room and property need updating. Stains on couches. Coffee table in living room was filthy. When I asked for pull out to be made| staff seemed annoyed to have to make the bed. When he opened up the pullout| sheets and blanket from previous guest was still on the pull out. He pulled all the sheets off the bed| then left it in a pile outside the room - I had to request the front desk to have it removed an hour later. Not a bad property| given the enormous size| but it definitely needs a facelift - especially a thorough cleaning.,Jun 3| 2019,4
Hotel is pretty shabby condition. Musty smell| trim falling off wall. Caulking holding everything together.,Jun 3| 2019,2
Fantastic location walking distance to central park to get away from the hustle and bustle and walking distance to time square.the tube station is just behind the hotel to take you straight to world trade centre.The hotel fantastic a bit  pricey for some stuff but hey it is New York |would stay there again,Jun 3| 2019,5
We had a great experience at the hotel. The staff was friendly and accommodating| the room was modern and clean| the food in the Herb and Kitchen restaurant was great and was included with the room. The bartenders and wait staff at the front bar were friendly and welcoming. Great location for visiting New York!,Jun 2| 2019,5
Location in midtown and proximity to Central Park and other destinations,Jun 2| 2019,5
On checkout we wanted to leave our bags as we had an evening flight home. When we went to check our bags we were charged $5 per bag to do so. I have never been charged to check bags anywhere else or in any other Hilton hotel and I found this to be quite disappointing after already paying more to stay here than elsewhere.,Jun 2| 2019,4
Everything In the hotel was stupid expensive... expected I suppose.  Nothing in the hotel really stood out. Our safe didn't work| our garbage pails didn't have bags in them| we were pressured into attending a Hilton honor club timeshare presentation which lasted 1.5 hrs| and were basically interrogated by the sleasiest salesman you could imagine.  2 hours wasted.  Left a horrible taste in our mouths.   We will never go back.,Jun 2| 2019,3
Very nice hotel in a great location.  Rooms are great but could have more amenities such as bottle openers| wine glasses| coffee maker.,Jun 1| 2019,4
Restroom is smelly. No shower gel and shampoo,Jun 1| 2019,2
In NYC for a graduation held at the Lincoln Center and this was the perfect location for all additional activities. We could literally walk any where we needed to go including Lincoln Center just over 1 mile away; Time Square; 5th Ave; Empire State Bldg.,May 31| 2019,5
This hotel is beautiful!  The staff is friendly and it is in the best location!  A couple blocks from Central Park| blocks from Time Square| and just up the street from Rockefeller Plaza!,May 31| 2019,5
Extremely outdated| especially for the price. You’re paying for the name ( which is not even great ) but this hotel is nothing special. It’s crowded| dirty and old. Let’s just say... you’re a needle in a haystack at this hotel. This hotel should be no more than 150$. I can’t believe I spent more than double that.,May 31| 2019,2
Computer problem at check in| took us 45mins to get to the room. Room is clean| beds are just a small full size; I understand the price issues but they should have equipped with queen size beds since they have enough space. A nice restaurant in property would be useful when it rain and people don't want to get out.,May 31| 2019,4
The food in their market was expensive and you didn't get much for your money.,May 28| 2019,4
hotel is excellent| overall condition| cleanliness| location very convenient| service very good. No complaints. Will come back,May 28| 2019,5
Upon my arrival| I told the Reservationist that my sister didn't make the trip and I wanted to downsize my room to a single.  The rate I was given thru Expedia (next time I won't use them) was $987.15 for our three night stay.   Then| the reservation person said I would have to pay additional charges ($225) for the change in reservation because it wasn't made thru the hotel???   Wow| that was a slap!   Not sure if I will ever use Expedia again or the NY Hilton Midtown based on the treatment I received.   Just thought you should know!,May 28| 2019,2
Nothing really| same old Hilton. Over price. But hey great location for NYC,May 28| 2019,3
Hotel is very large and traffic through it goes well.   Rooms just not clean enough although they were OK.,May 28| 2019,4
Check was great!! Coupons was a nice addition. The room was exactly what we ordered.  Pleasant stay!!! Definitely recommendable.,May 28| 2019,5
Location!!  Location!!!  Location!!!Had a good stay at this hotel but the location is perfect for the things I enjoy most,May 27| 2019,5
The location of the hotel was great. It was a short walk to everything we wanted to visit.,May 26| 2019,4
The location of the hotel is ideal for exploring all areas of NYC. It is a large hotel and most likely caters to business travelers; no boutique feeling here. The lobby is modern| welcoming| and the staff are friendly and helpful. The room had some updates (paint| wallpaper| headboard| comfortable bed) which were nice| but new carpet is in order. The bathroom was quite small and could use an update. The breakfast buffet is excellent and offers something for everyone. Overall I would recommend the hotel and I would not hesitate to stay there again.,May 24| 2019,4
Location was terrific close to everything. We’re able to walk to most attractions.Wish there had been better lighting in the room. Otherwise| no complaints.,May 24| 2019,5
The breakfast buffet at herb n kitchen was excellent and delicious. The omelette station George is excellent| so courteous and helpful. He deserves recognition for going above and beyond to serve his customers. George has definitely made our experience at Hilton memorable and enjoyable!,May 24| 2019,5
Amazing location. Walking distance to everything. Kind staff. Decent room| though lacked fridge and coffee which seems pretty much the norm these days. Fast elevators.,May 23| 2019,5
terrible serviceterrible serviceterrible serviceterrible serviceterrible serviceterrible serviceterrible serviceterrible serviceterrible serviceterrible serviceterrible service,May 22| 2019,1
Didn't stay long enough to enjoy amenities. Hotel was clean and friendly staff. no problem checking in. Just could have been more up front about fess when called to check on infromation,May 21| 2019,4
The location of this Hilton is great. Easy walking distance to almost everything. The room size is decent especially for New York. However| the rooms were lacking in almost every other area. I was given a handicap room even though I didn’t need or request one. Shower curtain wasn’t long enough. The entire bathroom flooded every time I showered. Huge slipping hazard. None of the outlets worked except for the one behind the nightstand. I had to curl and blow dry my hair without a mirror. No mini fridge even though there was a space designated for one. Made keeping leftovers or even a chilled drink impossible.,May 20| 2019,3
My guest had their credit card charged after I authorized a credit card to be used. I found this embarrassing. I contacted the hotel. Spoke to the staff prior to my guest's arrival. I followed their (the hotel's) instruction on authorizing a credit card. And instructed them that we wanted these special guests to have a pleasant experience. Yet their room was not ready upon their arrival and they were asked to pay fees that where to be charge to a card we had directed the hotel to use.,May 20| 2019,2
Very well organized and the cleanliness. Everything was properly in order.,May 19| 2019,5
Excellent staff.  Buffet breakfast really good.  Only problem issue we had was with the parking garage staff.  Took over an hour to get our car to put in some belongings.,May 18| 2019,5
The lobby & location were wonderful. Staff was very pleasant. The room was very disappointing. Very old/outdated and full beds instead of queens. Not like the picture on the website. I’m sure some rooms have been updated but ours was not one of those.,May 18| 2019,2
Check in took quite a while and our room wasn't ready.  They held our luggage and we came back later.  Stayed 3 nights.  We enjoyed the bar and the snack shop| but the day we checked out we had horrible bites on our body.  They checked our room and found bed bugs.  I'm still trying to deal with them to get my money back and my luggage replaced| but it's not been easy.  This is a good location| but PLEASE check the room for bed bugs.  They said they've treated the room| but who really knows.,May 16| 2019,1
Great stay.located walking distance to the main sights.friendly staff.easy check in and out.,May 16| 2019,4
Our booked room was not available once we arrived. I booked an accessible room for my father and it was not available| even though I booked 3 months in advance. We were given a temporary room in which we had to make our own bed.,May 16| 2019,1
Great location| walking distance to a lot of attractions| check in was very quick| the room was as described and a bit larger than expected - executive suite. We found the arrangement of lamps/lighting a bit odd. There was some trash left under the sofa by a previous guest but overall very clean and cleaned daily. Breakfast 5 times out of six had plenty of food available| one day we arrived late at 10am and there was little choice left mainly cold food even though they serve until 11am. Breakfast staff were excellent| food good quality although if it hadn't been included in the room rate I wouldn't have paid the 38.95 they were asking to pay on the door| far too much! and 5 dollars each for storing our suitcases for a couple of hours was extortionate. In places the hotel feels a little bit in need of a spruce up but considering the size and number of rooms that's not surprising. Overall we were happy with our choice of the Hilton Midtown,May 14| 2019,4
Comfortable room of reasonable NYC size.  Ideal location: close to Broadway| Central Park and numerous restaurants.  Good| efficient service and friendly front desk.,May 14| 2019,4
Beautiful property with all the amenities you need. Very quiet.,May 14| 2019,5
As| usual awesome stay| fantastic location!!!,May 13| 2019,5
The location and property were excellent. Total value for the money.,May 13| 2019,5
Great location walking distance from Times Square Clean comfortable rooms,May 13| 2019,5
This hotel is trying to pay back its renovation five dollars at a time in a way that is extremely frustrating for its guests.  My husband and I have been staying at this property for well over 20 years.  We used to love it.  It used to be one of our favorite hotels in Midtown.  When we checked in| and told the woman at the desk we were exhausted from our 4 am departure| she told us that while our room was ready -- we would have to pay nearly $60 for early check-in.  If we didn't pay| "who knows when you can check in."  We paid the fee but when I inquired when this became policy (we used to be able to check in early -- I'm talking for decades -- if the room was available)| she said "this has ALWAYS been our policy."  Then| she back pedaled and said they changed the policy a year ago.  One day| they didn't service our room at all.  Beverages in Herb 'n Kitchen (just a soda) cost nearly $5.  And| luggage storage at check out (when we stayed at the hotel!) cost $5/bag - no matter the size or nature of the bag.  It's just disappointing to be nickel and dimed at a property that is supposed to be a higher end venue.  All the coffee machines are gone from the rooms.  There is no complimentary water.  It's just sad to see the little amenities gone (some days we were given conditioner| some days only shampoo -- only one day body wash).  I mean| come on.  I know you just renovated but this is pretty silly at some point.,May 13| 2019,2
Great location. Clean building and rooms. Easy check in.,May 12| 2019,5
This is an amazing hotel but very costly. It’s in a perfect location for broadway. For the price it would be lovely if each room had a refrigerator and a microwave!!,May 12| 2019,5
The hotel lobby bar prepares the worst food  I have ever tasted! a five year old could make a better sandwich.,May 12| 2019,2
I would never stay at thus Hilton again. The hotel staff was extremely unapproachable and basically rude. There was no coffee pot in the room and they also charged 5 a bag to hold luggage. Very disappointed for the price we paid.,May 11| 2019,2
The staff was sweet and helpful. The room was great. Excellent location.,May 10| 2019,5
Location is good| area is safe| Breakfast was fantastic| room size was good  a coffee machine in room would have been nice,May 10| 2019,5
Everything about this property leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Service is absolutely nonexistent. They charged $55.00 extra if you arrive before 3:00pm to check in. They charge $30.00 per day extra for no reason at all --- which is illegal. They don't honor your Hilton Honors status at all. They open your room door without even knocking. They have no umbrellas when it rains. They don't offer free water in the room even tho Hilton is supposed to. Everything was quite terrible.,May 7| 2019,1
WATCH OUT FR THE EXTRA "URBAN SERVICE" FEE... Ridiculous extra fee for nothing,May 7| 2019,3
Old| dirty and expensive. I didn’t like that they charge you 5 dollars per bag to leave them for a few hours and on top of that they only take cash. They also have the nerve to say that tip is not included.,May 7| 2019,2
Great location| friendly staff and very spacious rooms. Nice perks when you use the bar or restaurant in the lobby. I will stay there again!,May 7| 2019,5
The addition of the "urban use fee" was a surprise| even though it was apparently disclosed.  There should be an option to opt out if one does not want to use the internet or the coffee shop.  Alternatively| why not just include the fee up front in the price?,May 6| 2019,3
Location was awesome.  Everything was great!  Rooms were a good size for NYC.,May 6| 2019,5
Heat was turned off leaving the room chilly and NO COFFEE machine,May 6| 2019,4
It would have been nice to have a coffee maker in the room.,May 2| 2019,4
It was amazing what I found in my room when I checked in. A beer on the night stand| dirty towels in the bathroom| and room keys on the desk. I went to the front desk an hour after requesting the room be cleaned and no one appearing. The second room offered wasn’t much better. Chip bags behind the dresser. It was very disappointing.,May 2| 2019,1
Happy with all except fee for luggage storage.Beds comfy.Rooms clean.,May 2| 2019,4
The view was perfect.Breakfast was a bit disappointing: no cheese| no sausage| no omelet etc,May 1| 2019,4
I loved how close it was to all the great things for a tourist in NYC,Apr 30| 2019,5
I loved the location! The staff was friendly| and the rooms were clean and spacious. I would recommend this hotel and I will definitely be coming here for my future trips. Thank you for the wonderful stay!,Apr 30| 2019,5
Not a big fan of the $30 resort fee.,Apr 29| 2019,4
The room was just fine| but they charged me an extra $25/night| unless I used things like the bar or the coffee shop. If I had not used the bar or coffee shop| they charged me $25. What if I did want to use the bar or coffee shop. Kinda strange.,Apr 29| 2019,2
Wonderful position on 6th @Avenue,Apr 29| 2019,5
Big| nice hotel.  Well-staffed| friendly and efficient.  Spacious rooms. Fabulous buffet breakfast; a little spendy| but it's NYC.,Apr 29| 2019,5
They have a very nice continental breakfast that came with the room.,Apr 28| 2019,5
Bell hops left us at the curb in garage waiting for our car to be brought up. Room was nice and location is excellent.,Apr 28| 2019,4
Old style| no spirit| too crowded; the staff with bat attitude. If you expecting a good experience with your hotel in New York this is not the place.,Apr 27| 2019,2
Excellent location and very good choice in NYC. Great overall experience.,Apr 25| 2019,5
Location was great| condition of building good|however they over book most of the time and you can't get the room you want| even with booking 2 months in advance,Apr 24| 2019,3
I really liked the location. The Herb-N Kitchen was convenient and I enjoyed Bridges Bar every night. What I didn’t like was the there were constantly large groups of school children. We saw at least 3 different groups come in| and with that there is a lot of noise in the halls from kids running around and enjoying a little bit of freedom. If you’re looking for a upscale hotel with little distraction| this probably isn’t the best. The rooms were okay| but not the cleanest (I found a half eaten piece of cheesecake in the mini fridge left from the person before). Lastly| the A/C was okay and just okay. I got hot every night even though I had it set on the lowest possible setting every time.,Apr 24| 2019,3
Conveniently located and staff friendly. Good for business travel,Apr 24| 2019,4
We thought this hotel was perfect for our family weekend in NYC.  The location is great.  Located in the middle of Central Park and Times Square| we could walk most places.  Subways nearby for those destinations that were further away.  If we were to go back to the NYC I would certainly stay at this hotel again.  They charged a $30/day fee on top of the cost of the hotel but with that you got wi-fi and a $20/day credit to be used in the bar (can be used as an aggregate amount) and $10/day for the restaurant on site.  The only disappointing thing was the service at the bar.  If you know that people are going to come to the bar to utilize their credit then you need to have more staff.  The poor guys working in the bar were not only the drink and food servers| but they had to make all of the drinks while the bartender and bar manager stood around. Tables sat full of dirty dishes.  It could be so much better in this regard.  But| that is our only complaint.  I would also recommend not to buy sightseeing passes or broadway theater tickets at the hotel...I was able to get them cheaper online and in person.,Apr 23| 2019,5
My room was very clean| very nice| and large compared to other NYC hotel rooms.  The hotel was centrally located| and there was no shortage of taxis out front!,Apr 23| 2019,5
Great place for a weekend family trip to NYC. If you disregard the incompetent staff of Herbs & Kitchen food counter in lobby| the place is perfect.,Apr 23| 2019,5
very nice and good surprise,Apr 23| 2019,4
Amazing experience had a great time thanks for the service bus boys where great,Apr 23| 2019,5
Need free wifi. Staff very friendly. Good location,Apr 23| 2019,5
Excelente ubicación | personal muy amable | check in y check out rápido y expedito| habitación cómoda |  muy buen desayuno buffet; el hotel cuenta con todos los servicios necesarios para tener una agradable estadía en la ciudad.,Apr 23| 2019,5
Beautiful decor| great food and beverage choices| comfy beds and baths.,Apr 23| 2019,5
Hotel was nice| rooms were large.   I only have two complaints. The air conditioning never got the room really cool and the breakfast buffet was $48 which is crazy!   Location was close to a lot of places.,Apr 22| 2019,5
Location is fantasticThe bar was understaffed in the late evening,Apr 22| 2019,5
Staff is very helpful!  Loved the restaurant and location.,Apr 22| 2019,5
Solid location for walking to popular destinations such as Central Park| Times Square| but also close to the subway for getting to the lower part of Manhattan. Great fitness center almost the size of a small budget gym with machines and weights.,Apr 22| 2019,5
Really close to everything and caps are much cheaper than expected. Lot of fun.,Apr 22| 2019,4
Great location| big rooms and very helpful staff all around the hotel. Breakfast is very good so it’s worthy to include it when you reserve. My only suggestion is to take care of cleanliness in rooms| carpets smells terrible as well as bathroom. Not pleasant at all! And please a bit more light in the rooms would be appreciated. For the rest great option to aya in NYC,Apr 19| 2019,4
We were able to get an early check in and the clerk was very polite. Then we had an employee approach us to give us some info for the local spots to visit along with a card that allowed for 15-20% off those places they recommended. They were very clean| smelled great and it was the exact atmosphere I expected for NYC. The hotel lobby is very busy but not enough for me to be annoyed by it. We didn’t visit the restaurant or bar there on the hotel but we always saw them packed out. The room was better than expected with a great view on the 17th floor. The only thing I didn’t care for was the elevator set up. There are separate elevators going to different sections of floors since they had so many and they are back to back so when it’s busy| it’s hard to spot when you get an elevator pick up because people are in the way so watch closely for your green light elevator pick up and shove people out of the way to get to it. Haha. Very pleased with this hotel overall.,Apr 19| 2019,5
We arrived at the hotel at 6:30 pm.  After standing in line for 30 minutes| we checked in only to be told that our room was not ready yet (check in starts at 3 pm per the hotel website).  The clerk did give us food vouchers to have dinner in one of their restaurants while we waited| but needless to say| our room did not become available until 8:45 pm| which messed up our plans for the evening.,Apr 18| 2019,3
Great view| AC did not work. Best location in Manhattan,Apr 17| 2019,4
Well located| comfortable rooms| a bit impersonal and limited eating options| but fine overall,Apr 16| 2019,4
We had a wonderful stay. Great location,Apr 16| 2019,5
Nice spacious gym.The lobby is always bustling with people and can be quite noisy.The daily consumption credit thing is a bit silly.$5 per piece luggage storage for hotel customers is not reasonable.The bar cannot do virgin cocktail...,Apr 16| 2019,3
Conveniently located near all major attractions and near the subway as well. Room was clean| and staff were friendly and helpful.,Apr 16| 2019,4
The location is great. As is the quietness of the rooms despite being on the busy 6th Ave and the blackout blinds and curtains| beautiful quality. The room type we had booked was not available on our first night which was very upsetting after a long journey and VERY long (2HRS) wait at JFK airport to get through passport control with 4 booths open at 9pm. Despite being given some breakfast coupons this did not replace our disappointment after a long journey from London. We had to move rooms on our 2nd day and despite reassurances that the hotel would move our lugagge| new desk staff insisted someone be present| which made us late for a booked trip which was stressful. My husband stayed and was forced to move the bags by himself and he noticed a funny smell when he put the cases in the room| but he was reassured that it would be dealt with while we were out. But when we returned it was clear that someone had smoked in our room on a non smoking floor. We then had to leave the room for the bar and despite being given 2 tokens this barely covered a drink each for me and my husband let alone for the kids soft drinks| plus we then had to charge the balance (tax and tips) to the room| while they de ionised it. We were forced to deionise the room for the rest of the stay after we  realised the smoking had occured in the bathroom and the wallpaper reeked. We were offered another inferior room but couldnt face another move so felt forced to put up with it.,Apr 16| 2019,4
I booked this hotel room in December for 4 adults| and two beds.  At check in we were informed we had a room with a king bed and a sofa bed that was supposed to have a new bed mattress. (NOT).  Called the manager and while we were comp’d one night (still haven’t seen credit on my card)| I am very displeased with hotels.com for not accommodating us considering the room was booked 5 months in advance.,Apr 16| 2019,2
The hotel was clean and greatly situated in the city. I have stayed here before and I knew it was the best so I went back. The only thing that is slightly disappointing is that both times I have stayed here I haven’t been able to get a late check out of even just two hours. I would have been willing to pay as well. I understand the rooms are fully booked but surely a few late check outs wouldn’t cause too much of an issue. It certainly wouldn’t put me off staying there again but it would have just been a nice little bonus for us.,Apr 16| 2019,4
Hidden fees that Expedia didn’t explain. $30 per night more and tried to tell us abou coupons make up for it. It doesn’t. Check on line your visa prior to check out. My bill doesn’t even match my VISA.  Not enough staff on at check out desk. Long| long waiting times. Overall still a good hotel. Clean and great location,Apr 15| 2019,4
Rooms were comfortable| good breakfast.  great location to shows and Times Square and subway,Apr 15| 2019,5
Very clean and staff very helpful. Would recommend to any of my family members,Apr 15| 2019,5
Line to check in was long and time consuming! Same to just talk to front desk in person. New $30 fee added charge tricky to keep track of!,Apr 15| 2019,5
City center and close to everything.  Resort fee (credit back) can be used to eat at restaurant/cafe inside hotel.  Only bad thing is $5 per luggage check.,Apr 15| 2019,4
Perfect location| easy access to everything. Room was clean with comfortable bed and awesome pillows. I was happy to be able to store the luggage for few hours after check out| before taking shuttle to the airport.,Apr 15| 2019,5
Property in terrible condition| like stepping back into the 1960s,Apr 15| 2019,1
Great location and great overall property but I didn’t appreciate the early check in fee and the amenities fee.,Apr 15| 2019,5
Great place to stay ..............................,Apr 14| 2019,5
Great location. Easy to get lots of places. Food and shops in the hotel.,Apr 14| 2019,3
Very very busy and therefore not very familiar but I guess that would be reasonably typical of a huge central hotel in New York.,Apr 14| 2019,4
Great location| really close to everything so it was really convenient getting around.  Clean and spacious rooms.,Apr 14| 2019,4
It’s location around important spaces of New York City,Apr 12| 2019,4
location is great! walking distance to all the major attractions in NYC,Apr 11| 2019,5
The location is great for a New York experience. The staff was very helpful when I suddenly needed to print tickets to a show that did not allow digital tix. A coffee pot in the room and wi-fi range were the only two things I’d like to see improved.,Apr 10| 2019,4
How close it was to everything in nyc and how friendly the staff was,Apr 10| 2019,5
Everything was perfect!,Apr 8| 2019,5
Great hotel| great location| safe| clean.  Made our trip to NYC amazing because it was so convenient to stay there!,Apr 8| 2019,4
Nice location| central location makes it convenient to everything.,Apr 8| 2019,4
Tremendous location! Right at the heart of everything,Apr 8| 2019,5
Stay in the exec suite- very nice! The staff was friendly and helpful.,Apr 7| 2019,5
Didn’t have room coffee or a microwave but had the Herb Basket that offered small conveniences. The latte I ordered was excellent but still would be nice to have some coffee and tea choices in the room.,Apr 7| 2019,4
Location| location| location!!! Great hotel! Highly recommend!,Apr 7| 2019,5
Our room was not available on our first night and hotel we were sent to didn't have hot water.... Upon our return no special accommodation were made.  Terrible,Apr 6| 2019,2
This property was okay location wise. The rooms are outdated and could use some renovation. The bathtub drain needs to be cleaned out to avoid standing water when taking a shower. I reported it to the cleaning person who said she would have the engineer take care of it| but that did not happen. Stayed that way for 5 days. Wont be staying here when I come back to New York.,Apr 6| 2019,3
The bathroom was filled with mold. The cabinets were hanging off and eventually broke. No room service or movies in room. Had to pay to have them hold luggage for a few hours. Oh and you will also have an additional $30/day charge,Apr 6| 2019,2
The location|rooms| cleanliness and staff were exemplary.The deposit and daily 25 euro payment is utterly confusing|and too difficult to decipher for more mature guests.I am still unsure as to what my credit card has been billed..This is the main criticism I have regarding this property/hotel.Clarity re charges could be easier to navigate.,Apr 5| 2019,5
There was blood on my sheets when I checked in and the service in the bar was absolutely horrible.,Apr 5| 2019,3
Very nice hotel. Centrally located. Minutes walk to Times Square,Apr 5| 2019,4
No microwave in the room| have to pay for it. Make you pay a 75 dollar check in fee and may you get a  food ticket that allows for you to purchase food within the hotel. If you don’t eat it all you owe the hotel.,Apr 4| 2019,3
The room smells cigarette| no refrigerator and no TV controller. So I called them to change the room because we do not want to stay for 3 nights without refrigerator.They said they would send people to spray out and have a controller. Some room does not have refrigerator. That's it. They hung up the phone while I was still talking. It was not nice though I understood they are treating thousands of customers.We were on 12th floor which has not remodeled yet. My friend's 6th floor was much nicer and new TV| chair| sofa| and amenities.But other than that| the location was so great to access to anywhere and other people were nice.,Apr 3| 2019,3
Very close to all attractions.  Walking distance to everything,Apr 3| 2019,5
Great location! Close to many sightseeing destinations! Awesome hotel credits provided,Apr 3| 2019,5
Location excellent very nice places st the lobby clean room,Apr 2| 2019,4
Customer service was excellent| the staff were very friendly especially with our two boys.  Our boys would tell us how the nice people would help them with cookies and/or drinks.,Apr 2| 2019,5
Central access to all areas in the city. Very convenient which made it ideal.,Apr 2| 2019,5
Great location for tourists.  The baggage check fee is very disappointing| $5 per bag is very steep| especially when you're a Hilton Honors Member| this should be complimentary| in my opinion.,Apr 1| 2019,4
Location is unique.Property is slightly old but it is NYC,Apr 1| 2019,4
This hotel is in a great location - near so much| plus metro stops. Our room was very clean and comfortable - even for 2 kids and 2 adults in one room. We requested extra towels and shampoo and it came immediately. The room was also very quiet - a nice refuge from the busy city below.,Apr 1| 2019,4
I will admit to being pleasantly surprised by this hotel.  My expectations were not very high going in.  We stayed 6 nights the end of March and our primary goal in NYC was to see shows and go to Moma.  It is directly across the street from Moma.   I don't enjoy the rat race of Times Square with all the crowds and the noise.  Midtown Hilton is a close walk to the show venues| but far enough away that you don't feel overwhelmed by tourists every second.  It is also a close walk to dining in Hell's Kitchen.  We had a room with two double beds and it was large.  Our room was very clean and the cleaning staff did a great job each day.  Everyone I encountered at the hotel was kind and accommodating.  I really don't have a negative comment except that the lobby is a bit of a zoo| but it's a large hotel so I'm sure that's to be expected.,Mar 31| 2019,5
very clean| organized and professional. The view is also beautiful,Mar 31| 2019,5
It was very close to everything however there were a lot of extra hidden fees.,Mar 31| 2019,3
Property was excellent and the area looked safe. Staff tho|  were not so accomodating.,Mar 30| 2019,4
The location was excellent - close to theaters| Central Park| and subway stations.  We did hear some street noise but never hotel noise.  The room was actually larger than I expected| plenty of space for the 4 of us.,Mar 30| 2019,5
The hotel was in an excellent location| very close to many places of interest,Mar 30| 2019,5
Perfect location for midtown NYC. Rooms were good sized for New York.,Mar 30| 2019,5
Great location| clean and quiet  on 34th floor| very comfortable bed,Mar 30| 2019,4
Front desk personal was friendly and let us check in early. The waiters at the buffet were attentive to our table.  Room was clean and plenty towels and pillows. Location close to Rockefeller Center and hop on off buses. Short walk to Time Square.,Mar 29| 2019,5
The location was perfect. Check-in was quick. It is a very busy property| so the noise in the hallway was a bit too much at night.,Mar 29| 2019,4
Horribly rude bar staff!,Mar 29| 2019,3
Hotel was great| just wish they had a coffee maker in the room,Mar 29| 2019,4
I really enjoyed staying here. Great location| beautiful hotel.  My only recommendation would be some seating in the lobby somewhere for someone who is disabled.  Wallking to the lounge down the hall is just too far when you're actually just waiting for the concierge| to check in or check out with family.,Mar 29| 2019,5
Beautiful hotel. Staff was kind and friendly. Every thing was clean and efficient.,Mar 29| 2019,5
Room was extremely hot and stuffy. Kept turning the air on and temperature to a lower degree of at least 68 but the room stayed at 71.  Bathroom counter space is small. Amenities are good if you’re looking for a big hotel with food| bar service. Location is great for tourists.,Mar 29| 2019,3
Hotel is close to most NYC attractions & subway. Short walk to theater| Central Park and Rockefeller Plaza. Staff is helpful & friendly. Elisco went out of his way to help us with checkout. He was great.,Mar 28| 2019,4
Excellent location. Lovely room.Shocked to have to pay to put luggage in room on last day | especially as we had already paid a resort fee .Hilton honors desk very pushy and then extremely rude when we decided against a viewing.,Mar 28| 2019,5
Great location - central to all the places and things we wanted to see and do.,Mar 28| 2019,4
The hotel needs an overhaul.  Paint chipping| torn wall paper.The resort fee is ridiculous - just adds complication to the overall booking.Staff were excellent and helpful.,Mar 28| 2019,3
La persona de recepción fue muy descortés. Hablaba Español y hasta el final nos habló.Fue en general un trato muy descortés de su parte. Es mi segunda estancia en este hotel y cambio mucho mi idea del hotel,Mar 27| 2019,3
I enjoyed staying at this property.  Very clean| nice sized rooms| centrally located with access to major venues.,Mar 27| 2019,5
This hotel has great location| clean room and friendly valet staff.,Mar 27| 2019,5
Service and staff friendly and clean! Nice and the beds were comfy we will stay again,Mar 27| 2019,5
No one offered to help me with my bags when I needed them stored. I was just told to go in the general direction of the luggage storage  Bell staff in general was the least helpful compare to any other hotel I’ve been to in NY.,Mar 27| 2019,3
Can not go wrong staying at the Hilton. Close to everything. Definitely staying here again the next visit to NYC.,Mar 26| 2019,5
Arrived around 7:45am and was told there's a $150 early check in.  I said I'll just come back later and asked what time is better for a lower early check in price.  The check in person said maybe try after 11am or 12pm.  He said he'll talk to the manager and came back and said they can give me a deal $100 for early check in so I said ok and now it's 7:55am as he checked me in.  When I checked out I asked another person how much is it for early check in and was told $150 6am-8am and after 8am it's $55.  I know hotel is a business and needs to make money but I asked clearly what time is a lower check in price and was told maybe after 11am or 12pm.  But their real policy was if I just waited 5 min until 8am I would of gotten the lower check in price.  That's not being honest and not a good way to treat their customers.  The hotel itself was fine| room was big| good location close to central park| Times Sq| Rockefeller Center| Radio City Music Hall| and restaurants.  The gym was a good size w/ many machines and free weights| and had large windows so it was bright and airy.  Too bad for the dishonesty at check in now I won't stay at this hotel again because of it.,Mar 26| 2019,4
Excellent location| great facilities.  Pleasant helpful staff,Mar 26| 2019,4
The lightning in the room could have been better and the refrigerator could have gotten colder,Mar 26| 2019,5
property was nice but out dated| elevator buttons stick,Mar 25| 2019,3
Great location. Just a few blocks from Times Square and Broadway. Felt incredibly safe where we were. Comfortable beds. Friendly staff. Food and beverage items were a little overpriced| but I found that to be true of New York in general.,Mar 25| 2019,5
This is a huge hotel. Don’t ever think that you will get any type of special treatment| or even good service. The Concierge was rude| other employees don’t really care to help. For the amount of $ that you will spend here| you can stay at much nicer and better served places.,Mar 25| 2019,3
Beautiful hotel| clean rooms. VERY busy - the lobby always had a ton of people in it. Don't expect any free amenities - no coffee maker in the rooms| free wifi only for Hilton Honors members (which we are| so I'm not sure how much it cost). $50 charge to check in early. The Lobby Lounge downstairs is quite pricey - we paid $55 for two burgers and an iced tea| though the burgers were delicious.,Mar 25| 2019,4
Upon arriving we checked in. The lobby is very nice| so that's always a good sign. We checked in and the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable. It was late and we were in need of something quick to eat| so they made a few good recommendations. The rooms here clean and very spacious for NYC. Everything seemed to be (somewhat) recently updated. Beds are very comfortable. TVs are newer and they provide premium channels which is always a plus. Bathrooms are nothing special| but still very nice. As far as other amenities go| they have a great little place for coffee/breakfast/snacks called Herb N' Kitchen. They also have a couple of bars to grab a bite or some drinks. Being in the heart of midtown there are plenty of nearby options as well.,Mar 25| 2019,5
Location is fantastic! Walking to many places is easy. Bar options also nice.,Mar 25| 2019,5
Great location.  Room was perfect.  Hilton team were very accommodating,Mar 25| 2019,5
Location was perfect...close to lots of things| from the park to Rockefeller Center to Time Square!,Mar 24| 2019,5
I like how close to different atractions the hotel is.The stuff at check in was nice and friendly but I can't say that about serves at those 2 bars in hotel. We went to both | the serves were not friendly at all and made us felel unwelcome. The other problem was elevators|  we stayed on 27th floor and only 2 elevators worked| it was a long wait!,Mar 24| 2019,3
Great location close to Times Square| 5Th Ave| Central Park etc. Very busy hotel but our room was lovely and quiet. The beds were really comfortable and the bathroom was clean.,Mar 24| 2019,5
This property is in a great location.  I didn't like that it did not have a coffee maker in the room.  The bathtub is super outdated and old.,Mar 24| 2019,4
Great location close to Central Park. Very clean and safe hotel.,Mar 24| 2019,5
Person checking us in didn't explain amenities| including wifi| shop and restaurant credits| etc. All of which are included in resort fee. Then| in room showerhead leaked and wouldn't stay up| kept falling down. Other than that| rooms are clean| property is beautiful with a great location.,Mar 24| 2019,4
Great location and easy access to the hotel.  Very clean and well maintained,Mar 23| 2019,5
Great hotel with quiet rooms and perfect night sleeps.,Mar 23| 2019,5
The location and the premises of the hotel are perfect. However| the open buffet breakfast despite being very generous and having wide selection tastes and feels horrible.,Mar 22| 2019,4
I didn’t like being charged $25 charge everyday for the bar or lounge.,Mar 22| 2019,5
I like the interior and design in the hotel.It was nice and unique !Our room was clean specially the bathroom.Staff was helpful and friendly !This our second time staying in your hotel.We love the location.,Mar 22| 2019,5
Didn’t like all the extra fees that they charge I feel like if you pay the price of the room you shouldn’t Automatically be charged additional fees for services you don’t use or want to use. I think you should be charged only if you chose to use their services.,Mar 22| 2019,4
everything was GREAT!!!!! everything was GREAT!!!!!,Mar 22| 2019,5
The staff were excellent except for Joyland in customer service. I don’t think it’s appropriate for staff to rudely state “that’s not what you said” out of frustration of the long lines for checking in. The hotel is a great place to run to Central Park| watch a show| walk to time square or 5th Avenue. The food is great. Clean| comfortable| and convenient. Note there is a $5 per bag fee for luggage hold.,Mar 21| 2019,4
So close to everything and staff was so friendly . Beds were super comphy and the maid service was great. Made for a great trip to nyc,Mar 21| 2019,5
Nothing unique about the hotel. Crowded at times. Location was good for general midtown activities. Rooms are small. Bathroom is small.,Mar 21| 2019,4
The 2 elevators working for the size of this hotel was problematic! Out bathroom had mold on the ceilings| bathtub was dirty| and someone’s dried up contacts on the floor. The room was hot a muggy and the front desk said the A/C wasn’t available since it was cold outside. The noise from the street NEVER stopped and we were on the 28th floor. Not even a coffee maker in the room.,Mar 21| 2019,3
Amazing location. Superb service from Lek with the concierge desk.,Mar 21| 2019,4
I didn't like the surprise of being told that there was a mandatory $90 charge.  I tried to fight it and told them that I didn't know about and that we were there for a funeral and would not use the forced amenity.  We ended up using only half of it.  Food was not great for such ridiculous prices.  I HATED THE POOR QUALITY OF TOILET PAPER.  WE WILL NOT STAY THERE AGAIN.  ALSO| THE MAN WHO EXPLAINED THE $90 MANDATORY CHARGE WAS NOT FRIENDLY AT ALL.  I TOLD HIM I DID NOT SEE THE FINE PRINT WHEN I BOOKED THROUGH EXPEDIA AND HE BOLDLY SAID 90% OF THE PEOPLE SEE IT.  I TOLD him i belonged to the 10% and he almost cockily told me that there was nothing he can do about it.,Mar 20| 2019,3
It has given me many great Memories .,Mar 20| 2019,5
It's a good place for business travel.  You can eat and drink in the hotel| its quite| and in a great location. There is a business and shipping center which is a big hep for me.  The rooms are clean| but didn't have a coffee maker.  The bar is open late enough to get a glass of wine before bed and they have amazingly addictive bar nuts.,Mar 19| 2019,5
This is a large| busy hotel. The location of is perfect| a short walk to almost everything! The room was clean| large (for NYC standards!) and comfortable. The service was very good. The breakfast buffet is excellent| and the bar and cafe (coffee|beer| wine| drinks| snakes and simple meals) very handy. We enjoyed the stay very much. I am going back in a few months with two friends and will stay here on that trip as well.,Mar 19| 2019,4
I had here for family trip. It's very convenient to anywhere. But it's noisy anytime.  I recommend you for trip or business.,Mar 17| 2019,4
The location of the New York Hilton could not be better if you want to be close to all the tourist spots. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful| in fact they can not do enough for you. The rooms were clean and comfortable but the washrooms need to be refurbished. We had to run the water in the shower for quite a while before it was hot enough to bathe. Overall it was good value and we will be back.,Mar 16| 2019,4
Perfect location| convenient to everything g.,Mar 14| 2019,4
Poorly staffed.  Was given the "NYC union rules".   For a 1|000 room hotel with no room service 10am to 6pm in NYC with travelers from all over the world = ridiculous.  Worse is the only food for delivery is pre-packaged.  Service from the front desk| to go market and other staff is SO SLOW.  hard to watch and harder to try and endure.  Wont return.  Suggest they buck up and get new management that isn't complacent.,Mar 14| 2019,2
Nice property in the middle of the city. Spacious room.,Mar 12| 2019,5
This hotel was very clean and easily accessible to t,Mar 11| 2019,5
We happened to be there at the same time as 100's of students from all over the world which made it a bit loud| busy and overcrowded.  Would have been nice to know that was going on prior to our booking.Other than that our stay was good.Sheldon Satterthwaite,Mar 10| 2019,4
Room could have benefited from a refresh... nothing too bad,Mar 4| 2019,4
sink was extremely small and the makeup mirror was so low that you had to put your face in the sink to see in the makeup mirror....don't know what they were thinking to put the mirror in that location....rooms could be updated a bit...,Mar 4| 2019,4
The room was conveniently located near the elevator. Room was spacious| without coffee machine| microwave or mini fridge. I understand this is a way to lead people to the restaurants in the lobby. Heater was not working. Complaint to customer service saw maintenance arrive in 45 minutes to take care of the minor issue. Breakfast was plentiful and with varied choices. Lobby was noisy| to be expected in this location. Overall| nothing extraordinary. Price of food was as expected in nyc - small bottle of water - $4| 1 small banana - $2.,Mar 3| 2019,3
Amazing,Feb 27| 2019,5
Property was i in excellent  location| close to Times Square and the subway stations | my only issue is upon check in you feel like you are being nickled and dimed| on top of the 30 dollars you pay each night they also take a 50 dollar deposit each night that is refunded but that was a little surprise| other than that the hotel was very nice | almost forgot the pillows way too soft !,Feb 26| 2019,4
I got there at 12:00 Noon there was a room available andy ou wanted to charge me $55 to get the room earlier.  If this policy continues I will not be staying at your hotels.  If there a room you should let me in and get settled.  this is wore then the airlines charging me to get on a earlier flight when there is a seat on the plane taking off empty,Feb 25| 2019,1
I love the beds and bedding and that there are refrigerators in the room  Great fitness facility,Feb 25| 2019,4
Pleasant hotel.  Great conference.  Expensive but nice snack shop.  Nearby restaurants all too expensive.  Hotel needs more comfortable lobby srating.,Feb 24| 2019,4
Good hotel in a great location.  Rooms are large for NYC| lovely bright lobby with busy atmosphere| bars and casual eateries in hotel were nice.,Feb 22| 2019,4
Great location few blocks from time square. Easy access to subway in multiple directions. Late night sit down food is a couple blocks away but they do have some food stands across the street.,Feb 22| 2019,5
Couldn’t fault this hotel have stayed there so many times and it never fails to live up to expectations. Our concierge was so helpful her name is Lek. And at checkout the lady  at checkout joyland. Couldn’t have asked for better 5stars from me thanks,Feb 22| 2019,5
Amazing location - within awalking distance from many tu| friendly staff.,Feb 21| 2019,4
The hotel was centrally located in midtown and close to everything.  Room was large| for New York| and clean.  The bathroom was a little dated and stained but other than that was great.  Overall was happy with the experience and would recommend to someone wanting a safe| comfortable| convenient| and corporate hotel.,Feb 20| 2019,4
Really had a great 3 night stay...only criticism was prices for food and beverage. Guess that’s because we were in NY...hotel was clean| and rooms and beds were very comfortable.  Staff was very cordial and helpful.  Great walking location.,Feb 20| 2019,4
mandatory fee every night to use toward extremely overpriced kitchen and bar at the hotel,Feb 20| 2019,2
We were in the center of it all.  Near | radio city| Rockefeller center| nbc studios and all the great restaurants the city has to offer.  My family and I had a great time.,Feb 20| 2019,5
Hotel overpriced. Rooms dirty. Staff rude. First and last time.,Feb 20| 2019,2
The location is great. The fact that I did not earn Hilton Honors points for this stay Because it was through Travelocity I found to be very disappointing. Also I was not able to use the two credits that were mandatory and missed out on approximately $70.,Feb 19| 2019,4
It was a great  location    The staff was very helpful when asked for recommendations or best way to get somewhere    It had easy acces to subway and bus tours.,Feb 19| 2019,5
Customer service was good but our room felt like a sauna. Everyone was complaining about how hot it was. Considering heat rises and all rooms are on upper floors| it was miserable. We tried cracking the windows (they only lift up two inches) but that did no good. It was 80-85 and freezing outside. You’d think they’d have better temperature control.,Feb 19| 2019,3
I should not have been charged a daily $25 amenity fee. Never have been charged before. Booked a queen size bed & received a smaller bed & room was much smaller than past. Probably will not return Thank You Ed Evanoff,Feb 19| 2019,1
Was not happy with mandatory $25 /per night “urban destination fee” that was added on.  This should have just been added to the nightly room rate since we did not have a choice. This was not one of the taxes cities impose but rather a hotel charge,Feb 19| 2019,4
The view was great| and the location was convenient! No complaints.,Feb 19| 2019,5
This was in a great location. Easy to walk to Times Square and other attractions. Room was clean and spacious!,Feb 19| 2019,5
The only thing i see missing is coffee in the room.,Feb 19| 2019,5
The room| location| cleanliness| comfort were all great| our only mention would be the long waiting at the front desk| whether for check in| question| luggage| etc.  It was a holiday weekend however so could be the issue but other than that from the bellboy to the front desk (when we did make it to the front of the line!) the service was great and everyone was very accommodating.  Would stay here again.  Location| taxi service| etc.| were all extremely convenient for Broadway show and places to eat.,Feb 18| 2019,4
Check in was took way too long| very long lines to get to the front desk.,Feb 18| 2019,4
Nice hotel centrally located. Enjoyed the ciity of New York,Feb 18| 2019,4
Dated room. No in room amenities . No fridge | water| snacks| nothing. Super dated. Needs a refresh . Service in lobby was good. Lobby is lively and seems promising. Once in room all the promise is gone,Feb 17| 2019,3
Check in staff had an attitude. Building is old and rooms aren’t appealing,Feb 17| 2019,3
Check in and checkout was smooth and easy. Our room and overall experience seen in the hotel was extremely clean. Staffwas very welcoming and friendly as well. Our shower handle was a bit wobbly like it probably needed fixing but everything about our stay was great. We also enjoyed the complimentary breakfast buffet we had.,Feb 16| 2019,5
Hotel good front desk charges twice doble under investigation,Feb 11| 2019,4
I had great time,Feb 11| 2019,5
Long wait to check in if not in their HHonors program. Essentially ignored for almost 20 minutes| almost no one else checking in.,Feb 11| 2019,3
Wonderful hotel but the staff at check-in was very rude.,Feb 9| 2019,4
The room service sandwiches were horrible! Otherwise I enjoyed my stay.,Feb 6| 2019,4
Don’t like your beds & pillow. Too soft!! Room was very roomy & nice.,Feb 6| 2019,4
everyone very courteous. The front desk could have been a little bit more helpful when we asked for an upgrade. Not impressed. The chef at the center bar was outstanding and went out of his way for us. Give that man a raise| great customer service as it should be.*****,Feb 5| 2019,5
Bathroom was so small.,Feb 2| 2019,4
Spacious corner room. Cleaning staff in hallway were very friendly.,Feb 1| 2019,4
This hotel continually disappoints. After multiple stays. No iron in room and took almost 45 minutes to get one. No coffee make in room for a quick cup in the morning (even La Quinta’s give you a cheap cup in the room). Too crowded downstairs in cafe to quickly get anything (as they herd everyone there).Simply not impressed.,Feb 1| 2019,2
Great location| amazing beds and pillows. Beautiful| luxury lobby. What you’d expect in NYC!,Feb 1| 2019,5
Nice rooms| don’t like the resort fee for i didn’t get my monies worth,Feb 1| 2019,4
Nice hotel staff was very welcoming & the room was ready early. Room was very clean,Jan 31| 2019,5
Friendly staff| clean room. Convenient for conference.,Jan 31| 2019,5
No coffe in rooms| no room service and only grab and go,Jan 30| 2019,3
Exceptional experience| location| room size and cleanliness| and the breakfast buffet rivals any that I have ever experienced| anywhere!,Jan 28| 2019,5
Great stay.....clean| awesome view and such nice service!,Jan 28| 2019,5
The location was fantastic. The room could have been cleaner. The door handle to the bathroom came off and was very off-putting.,Jan 28| 2019,4
Perfect location for tourist!  Very good breakfast and staff!,Jan 28| 2019,5
Excellent location in midtown. Great hotel with surprisingly spacious rooms,Jan 28| 2019,5
BEST LOCATION|KIND STAFF..SPECAILLY| I WANNA THANK FOR THE STAFF IN THE BUFFET RESTAURAN|T WHO PROVIDED ME LUNCH BAG KINDLY| WHEN I COULD'NT HAVE BREAKFAST!!,Jan 28| 2019,5
Beautiful hotel perfectly located. The cleaning staff| registration agents and concierge were all excellent! I only have two complaints: 1) I quickly grew tired of the aggressive time share sales people harassing me each and  every single time I entered the hotel. I’m not interested means I’m not interested. I’m on vacation. Leave me alone. 2) The grab and go offered molded fruit and spoiled yogurt. No room service. Best to order delivery. Disappointing for a high end hotel this size.,Jan 28| 2019,4
Great property| good location. The room was surprisingly quiet.,Jan 28| 2019,4
Good location....nice size room....clean and updated,Jan 27| 2019,4
Great stay. Room was spacious for a NYC king. Definitely pay the fee for the free breakfast. It’s an unimaginable feast!,Jan 27| 2019,5
Great location| you walk to most popular locations. We would definitely stay there again.,Jan 26| 2019,4
I booked a room here for convenience because I was attending an event at the hotel that night.  Upon arrival they checked me into a room that was already occupied and getting it resolved cost me all the time that I had planned to get ready for the black tie event and I was actually late to the party because of their incompetence.  The managers took too long to resolve the situation and they did not even express any apology or concern that they ruined the start of my evening.  For what it cost me including overnight parking they should be ashamed.  I did not even receive a courtesy call or follow up from them.,Jan 26| 2019,1
Large Hotel in the center of the theater district| convenient to theaters but to get to the rest of the city the traffic can be horrendous.  Mediocre very large hotel -- no specific complaints but also nothing to get excited about.,Jan 25| 2019,3
The property is centrally located and close to most NY venues.  Friendly staff; excellent breakfast buffet.Would have liked to have a coffee maker in the room.,Jan 23| 2019,5
Friendly staff| nice room and great breakfast! Great location in midtown.,Jan 23| 2019,5
Excellent location| walk to Rockerfeller Plaza| Times Square| Central Park| etc. my overall service was excellent.,Jan 22| 2019,5
Everything was very nice however it would have been great to have a refrigerator in the room. Overall| it was a nice place though.,Jan 22| 2019,4
The room itself was basic| and a bit tired. Great location and great amenities within the hotel. I’d go back.,Jan 22| 2019,4
Very noisy on floor 39| sounds like water going through the pipes every two minutes.,Jan 21| 2019,3
Small room off odd hallway w/ closet for housekeeping. Fridge removed from room. Bathroom faucet leaked. Rail in bathroom broken. Toilet barely flushed & stopped flushing entirely. Called to report toilet. Was transferred to another extension while mid sentence. Ext. rang 25x's- no answer. Called again. After 40 min waiting for someone to fix toilet| got dressed| left room to find lobby toilet. Passed repair guy in hall. Ridiculous. Worst room ever.,Jan 21| 2019,3
We loved the location. The only thing we didnt love| was no coffee machine in room and no vending machines for late night drinks.,Jan 21| 2019,5
Everything was great| the room| desk staff| and security. I left my purse in a restroom and it was found and returned safely. My only issues were the very rude waiter in the lounge bar and the fact that the restaurant closes early on Sunday mornings which sucked after a long night in the city never sleeps. A great brunch would have been fabulous before leaving for the airport.,Jan 21| 2019,4
Great location. Good breakfast buffet and snack bar,Jan 20| 2019,5
Excellent location| decent price| roomy suites considering its NYC.,Jan 20| 2019,4
Apparently I was in the room below the elevator motor (so I was told when I complained). The knocking from the motor went on all night. Very loud. I will say the staff did their best to accommodate me because there was nothing they could do.,Jan 18| 2019,2
Attended Broadwaycon held in the hotel.  Staying in the hotel was so convenient and the Hilton is a favorite of mine.,Jan 15| 2019,5
This is a great hotel located right in the center of Midtown.  It was just a few short blocks from all the Broadway Theaters and Times Square.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  I really enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay again.,Jan 15| 2019,5
Great location.  We were charged an "urban" fee at the end of our stay at $25.00 per night.  Not quite sure what this additional charge means?,Jan 14| 2019,4
Over all it was a good stay.  Need more people at checkin.,Jan 13| 2019,4
We are at BroadwayCon. Everything is great fir the most part. The public bathrooms seemed like that they were not in perfect working condition on The first day. Hard to regulate room temp.,Jan 12| 2019,4
Great location to theaters and restaurants.Fabulous breakfast buffet. Lively bar scene.Excellent service throughout hotel. Got a very reasonable room rate. Would not stay anywhere else in NYC except the Hilton midtown.,Jan 12| 2019,5
Considering the price| I expected some hotel more modern| with bigger beds. It seems different than the photos.SO crowded| so we needed to wait more than 30 min to check-in. If you go by car and need to use the parking| it is really expensive.,Jan 9| 2019,3
Good location| shame it doesn't take advantage of upper floors for a restaurant / bar. Size of the hotel makes the lobby level amenities very overcrowded.,Jan 9| 2019,5
Our suite was quite large| which is unusual in New York. The decor is extremely dated. The continental breakfast at the Executive Dining Room was the worst I've ever experienced. Even cheap hotels do better. Really a disgrace.,Jan 9| 2019,2
Unacceptable| rude staff members| not willing to help you|,Jan 9| 2019,1
Stayed two days in early January.  Urban King room was nice size with nice view.  Rate on expedia was excellent.  Previous week was twice as much.  Check-in person was especially pleasant.  Check-out line in morning was way too long.  Need to put more people on at checkout time.  Hotel location is excellent to everything... right in the heart of midtown.  Easy to get to Broadway shows| restaurants| etc...Would definitely stay there again,Jan 8| 2019,4
I loved the location. It's close to everything that a first time visitor needs to see. The only thing I didn't like is that they charge $5 a bag to hold your luggage after the check out.,Jan 8| 2019,4
Staff uncoopertative.Hotel basic...poor décor...……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………...,Jan 8| 2019,2
Overall the hotel was fine. The bed was uncomfortable and the sheets were like an sos pad.,Jan 8| 2019,4
I always choose Hilton However this time I made the wrong decision.  Staff was very rude and Ingot charge for an early check in I have never heard of that. I am a travel agent and I will not be recommending this place to my clients.,Jan 8| 2019,1
I liked the location| friendliness and the service. The staff was outstanding. Some components of this facility need to be updated such as the carpets. The surfaces in many areas needed to be cleaned and our couch had several stains. Very nice hotel,Jan 7| 2019,5
After queuing for ages to check in the room we were given was nothing like the room shown on Expedia when booking.When booking the room we chose it because it looked modern with 2 beds in the room & we have had previous good experiences with Hilton hotels.Unfortunately we had a much older| tired looking room with no bed for our son. No bedding or towels either.There was a very old delapidated sofa bed in the room which we had to make up ourselves from sheets that I managed to get from a maid who happened to be  passing. The sofa bed was so old that  it gave our son backache for the whole of the holiday.No tea or coffee making facilities in the room & in the second room we booked there was no fridge either| just an empty cupboard.Not a great experience at this hotel. No other rooms available as all booked up.We paid A LOT of money for these rooms & it REALLY wasn’t worth it.Won’t be staying here again.On the plus side the inclusive breakfast was good with very helpful staff & great selection of food.Didn’t like having to pay the ‘resort fee’. It was a way of making you buy food & drinks from their very overpriced deli/shop & bar.,Jan 7| 2019,2
This hotel is no fail. Perfect location: not too busy| not too quiet. Rooms are generous in size| it’s my go-to for leisure and business,Jan 6| 2019,5
First receptionist was not accommodating to room types even after requesting a lower-priced room for one of our rooms. Second receptionist in the evening accommodated us. It was way too hot in the rooms and no air conditioning in January so they have  gave us fans to put in front of an open window to bring in some cold air.  Hard to sleep with an open window in NYC and a fan running all night. Will go elsewhere next trip.,Jan 6| 2019,3
Extremely long lines for check in a very short staff the last day of our stay they provide a list of restaurants and other activities with discounts that unfortunately we could not enjoy. This process needs to improve,Jan 6| 2019,4
Location was great for us but no microwave|fridge| or coffee maker in room. I am sure it was accurately described online but disappointed it didn’t have those amenities,Jan 5| 2019,3
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Hilton Midtown in Manhattan. The hotel was clean and comfortable. It is in a great location that is close to everything. Value wise I think it is well worth it. Highly recommended.,Jan 5| 2019,5
Staff is very nice and helpful.location is great.they have bar|kitchen and club inside the hotel.It was very clean overall.The security system is really nice.The photo booth located in front is really nice.,Jan 5| 2019,5
Poor Customer Service. The employees in the check in was rude.,Jan 5| 2019,3
Over all my stay was great.. great staff and amineties. But|  I wished that the check in proccess was not so chaotic| and the long lines and wait time improved. Granted it was during New year's week.. but then it should have been better.  Also did not like the fact the bag check was not free for hotel guests.,Jan 5| 2019,4
We decided to take a trip to NYC a few days before New Years.  We expected it to be busy and it was!!  BUT| the Hilton Midtown did everything in their power to accommodate the hoards of people who were showing up.  We waited in a bit of a line to check in but they walked around with bottled water for everyone.  We also waited in a line for breakfast| but they were so friendly and accommodating to our large group (7 people).  The breakfast was great!  The stay was great!  The room décor could be improved but it was still comfortable.  The staff was friendly and I can't say anything bad.  They did their best given the circumstances (NYE in NYC!).... Thanks Hilton!,Jan 4| 2019,5
Good location| near Central Park| Times Square and much more. Large hotel but gets quite too busy for the amount of staff.,Jan 4| 2019,3
Nice hotel but very big and very busy.  Expect long lines and for it to be crowded and little possibility for early check in so many patrons cluttering lobbies with luggage and no where to go.  Some front desk staff very friendly others not as much.  Also the address to the hotel cannot be found in ride sharing map apps which made it difficult to navigate to and from the hotel.,Jan 4| 2019,4
The room was lovely but I did find mold in my shower disappointed for the price in Location,Jan 4| 2019,5
All staff were very friendly and accommodating.  Good location - very clean and comfortable.,Jan 3| 2019,5
The rooms need a coffee pot|other than that it was good,Jan 3| 2019,4
This property has no idea how to mange the large volume of guests. Check-in was over an hour even though we are Hilton rewards members and should have been able to check-in with our phone. The reasoning as to why it took so long was that staff was on break. I am certainly all about staff taking a break but when check-in is at 3pm| why in the world would you not send them all before that.  Despite telling us over and over that it was the busiest week out of the year| they ran out of everything and handled staffing in ways that made no sense.To be fair| the staff ( servers and housekeeping) worked hard. Out of 5 days our room stayed dirty one day until it was time to go back to sleep. We found popcorn and other food items on the floor in our room - which were items we never ate. So don’t feel the room was cleaned very well.,Jan 3| 2019,1
need to have a restaurant to have dinner as guests,Jan 3| 2019,5
Magnificient buildings and very clean streets. The place was just so busy and crazy.,Jan 3| 2019,5
On the 23rd floor near the elevators was very noisy in the room above and in the hallway. The worst part was that the ac would only cool the room to 74 and it was stuffy and hot to sleep in that temp. We kept a the windows open to try to get some air but they only open about 2 inches. The lobby always had crowds of people waiting to check in with only 3 lines open it was a very long wait to get checked into the hotel.,Jan 3| 2019,3
The location was great. rooms small no coffee maker in room. There is no way to check in early or they charge you. when I booked the room it was advertised that breakfast was included but no one new anything about that when we arrived.,Jan 3| 2019,2
Nice hotel| great location. My only complaint is that it took us 10-15 mins each time to take an elevator because the hotel was full due to the holidays.,Jan 2| 2019,4
Great location| but not worth the price.  Room small| bathroom was dirty.  Everything pricey.,Jan 2| 2019,4
Very busy time in NYC - very long lines at check-in| but staff was nice and helpful.,Jan 2| 2019,4
We were late checking in| but the staff was very friendly. They were sold out| so they upgraded our room to a suite. It was lovely and such a treat after a long day of travel.,Jan 2| 2019,5
Location is great. On site restaurants are limited,Jan 2| 2019,5
Great hotel| rooms are clean| beds extremely comfortable| friendly staff and perfect location!,Jan 2| 2019,5
Check in/check out process is ridiculously long.  They should implement auto check out system.  Also| you have to pay to store luggage??? This is the first time I’ve seen this,Jan 1| 2019,3
Everything about the stay was quite fine ... until checkout: I waited about half-an-hour in line! (Actually| upon reflection| I had waited a good 15 minutes at check-in| too. However| I wasn't in a hurry then.) On the day I was checking out| I had an appointment to meet a friend. I allowed 15 minutes in my schedule| but that wasn't enough.However| once I got to check-out| in addition to apologizing immediately for the wait| the clerk also cancelled out the "Resort fee" of $25 per day as well as an additional $25 on my bill from the restaurant. That made a total savings of $75. I was totally appeased.,Jan 1| 2019,4
Cleaning lady was very rude she was misbehaving with us,Jan 1| 2019,5
Convenient and very nice.  Price was good for NYC and a Hilton Hotel,Jan 1| 2019,5
This is a very busy hotel but a great location in NYC.  If you are driving it is very difficult to pull up to the front of the hotel on 6th avenue.  Also| their valet parking is a few blocks away.  They tell you at the front of the hotel to go the corner and make a left| left go block and make a left and then one more block and make a left and the parking gargarge is in the back of the hotel.  Unfortunately| in NYC you are unable to make a left at all of these lights.  You end up several blocks away and if you are not careful| you will end up at the Hilton located in 2 blocks away.  Also| there is no coffee machine in the room| no bags to be found if you wanted ice and no cups for your room.,Jan 1| 2019,3
Very nice property| excellent location| very close to central park.,Dec 31| 2018,5
Clean efficient and in the heart of everything!! Staff was helpful and accommodating for our every request.,Dec 31| 2018,5
Was allowed to check in a bit early. Great location and great staff,Dec 31| 2018,5
Enjoyed having the deli downstairs...........really good food,Dec 31| 2018,5
We stood in a very long line and had to wait one and half hours to check in.  We were told a pull-out sofa would be in our room to accommodate a sleeper| but it was not.  The room had no coffee maker.  No bottled water (or anything else) in the fridge.  Towels did not smell clean.  Expected more from a Hilton hotel.,Dec 31| 2018,3
Very well located| nearby Times Square| Rockfeller Plaza| Central Park and Museum of Modern Atrs.,Dec 31| 2018,5
Excellent. I will return. The only negative detail| was during the check in process the process was too long. One hour. Maybe because of the dates after christmas day.,Dec 31| 2018,5
We had to wait 3 hours for them to come and make our pull out couch.  Also| our iron wasn’t working,Dec 31| 2018,2
Rooms were tiny. No ac| and heat was stuck on. Tv was terrible. Place was an absolute packed madhouse and staff were always rude.,Dec 31| 2018,2
Beautiful property. Ridiculously overpriced food and no access to anything like coffee or even a drink machine without going to the lobby and paying out the nose for it. Unwittingly paid $145 for a so-so breakfast in their Herb and kitchen restaurant. My 8 year old ate one croissant and they still charged me $40+ for her meal. Absurd!!!  No coffee or frige in the room. Staff only moderately friendly.,Dec 31| 2018,3
Long waiting to check in/out.  Booking thru Hotel.com. being punished for $100 surcharge! and not honor for Hilton points.  The organization might as well not participate in outside Sals Programs. Microwave in the room for $35 extra!,Dec 31| 2018,4
No coffee in the rooms and a 30 minute wait to get coffee in the lobby.  Beds were small and room was very small.,Dec 30| 2018,2
We were in room 613. View from window was huge mechanicals units.  There was a constant loud hum from these units which made it difficult to sleep. I was satisfied with the hotel but NOT the room.,Dec 30| 2018,4
Not very pleasant place to stay. Overall not pleased. Daily charges are too high. They said free wi-fi but you pay for it daily. Only food service is fast. No restaurant unless your a privileged guest. Security is poor as well.,Dec 30| 2018,3
Walkable & accessible to sites in midtown Manhattan.Staff are friendly. Negative is the length of time I was standing in line for check in. They should put more people during peak check in time.,Dec 30| 2018,5
Nice clean hotel -I’d stay here again . Great location !!!,Dec 29| 2018,4
Very nice hotel| with a good location| very modern decoration and everything clean. Very friendly Jose (Puertorican bartender) from the bar. We spend 6 days including Christma's day | and the hotel had a nice ouch to leave in our room a christmas gift for our 5 years old little son | with a very nice postcard from Santa | sincerely our stay was perfect | we definitely recommend it for families and without any doubt in the future we will consider returning. Thank you very much.,Dec 29| 2018,4
Had “guaranteed” rooms because we paid well in advance and they were non refundable but upon arriving to check in| they told us they were sold out. They then tried moving us to a hotel further away. They ended up stuffing 5 of us in one small room and refunding the 2nd room because they didn’t have one available. Either hotels.com or the Hilton were at fault. I don’t think I’ll ever use Hotels.com again| as they still haven’t answered my questions as to how this happened.,Dec 29| 2018,3
I liked the location of the property and cleanliness of the room however this hotel lacked amenities such as coffee maker| microwave and refrigerator in rooms.,Dec 29| 2018,4
Excellent location - centrally located| close to 5th Avenue| Central Park| Rockefeller Center and Time Square.The shower would turn cool when it was turned to the hottest temperature before it became warm| then hot and sometimes cool again.,Dec 29| 2018,4
Nice hotel ubication| only a couple blocks from Rockefeller Center and Times Square.,Dec 29| 2018,4
We checked in Christmas Day and when we arrived the line was almost out the door and there were 2 clerks checking people in.  We had lunch and tried again but the line was just as long| but fortunately they had more clerks.  We were there 3 days and saw this same line everyday.  The rooms are spacious and the location is excellenr.  The bar had no Ginger Beer to make Moscow Mules which seems strange since it’s such a popular drink.  They also had no regular olives for my martini| only Bleu Chrese and the bartender put them in my drink without asking me.  The coffee is great there but the line each morning when we woke up was at least 15 minutes to get coffee.,Dec 29| 2018,4
Convenient and close to a lot of shopping and food,Dec 29| 2018,4
Good location. We had a corner room on the 23rd floor with lovely view through the skyscrapers to Central Park.,Dec 29| 2018,4
It’s a great location and nice hotel. Rooms with fridges should have microwaves. I was very upset there was not a single drinking fountain in the building and you’d have to pay $4 for a small bottle of water if you didn’t want to leave the hotel. I was pregnant with two children| so that was pretty disappointing. Other than that-we had a wonderful stay.,Dec 28| 2018,3
Excellent location near to Time Square| MOMA and Rockefeller Centee (walking distance). Room clean and comfortable.,Dec 28| 2018,5
Location is the best I’ve stayed at in nyc Had everything I needed    Staff very accommodating. Right by Radio City Music Hall| Rockefeller center| Central Park| and Time Square.,Dec 28| 2018,4
Nice Hotel. I will recommend to my all friends. Amazing location and food. Hotel staff is amazing,Dec 28| 2018,5
Check out service was much better than Check inStaff are rude Rooms are soooooo small Best thing is the herb & kitchen food,Dec 28| 2018,3
Good location| easy check in. Rude and confused staff members and front desk manager.,Dec 28| 2018,3
Never stayed in a hotel where you had to queue so much for everything- 40 minutes to check in| 30 mins to check out| 20 mins for a coffee| waited 15 mins one day for an elevator down to reception before giving up and walking down 19 floors of stairs. “Resort fee” is also a rip off - whilst you can redeem this against the bar and coffee shop in the hotel you don’t come to New York to sit in a Hilton hotel bar when there are so many better options on the doorstep. Only saving grace is the location for midtown shopping| Central Park and Times Square,Dec 28| 2018,2
If location is most important to you then this is a good hotel| if service is important| look elsewhere.The hotel is located in a central and convenient location to shopping| attractions and the subway. Rooms are spacious| which allows the hotel to be a family friendly hotel which means be prepared to hear children running down the hall and having fun early in the morning. The day of our arrival| we called to reconfirm our reservation and were told we didn't have a reservation. After the central reservationist called the hotel| she finally "located" our reservation. Ironically| throughout our stay| we witnessed guests being turned away at the front desk because of reservation discrepancies. Be sure to reconfirm your reservation prior to your arrival to avoid unnecessary aggravation. Our room package included a daily Full American Breakfast| which we only were able to take advantage of one of the four days because the daily wait for a table was 2 hours long. Plan and budget accordingly. Not sure why the hotel offers breakfast when they can not accommodate the guests in a timely manner. Upon departure| we were approached by a hotel employee to take advantage of the express check-out because the check out lines were an hour long. We agreed to an express check out being that we were told we would receive a copy of our room invoice that evening| well| here we are 5 days later and still no invoice. We will not be returning to this hotel.,Dec 28| 2018,3
Fantastic location. Many attractions were within blocks. Check-in and out were fast and easy. Room was spacious. Beds and linens were comfortable and soft. Room and bathroom were clean| but a little worn. Disappointed with food at Herb n’ Kitchen. Seemed like this was the only in-house option for meals for a family.  What they offered was limited in variety| mediocre/poor in taste | and overpriced.  We ordered a cheeseburger and it was completely raw in the middle. We expected to pay a lot for food and drinks| and would have been fine with it if they were good. Service in the restaurant was also subpar.,Dec 28| 2018,4
The hotel check in took more than an hour. They didn’t have enough personnel for the amount of guests. Tables at the bars were absolutely dirty| empty cups all around| the Executive Lounge had the soda machine broken| coffee machines broken. In simple words: too many guests with an improper amount of staff members.,Dec 28| 2018,1
Great location.  Cleean rooms| very friendly staff| awful management.  Terrible check in/out procedures.  Lines hours long| no answer on customer service phone.|  TV check bill/ check out procedure not working|  "free internt but $1.00/minute to us business center.  Very confusing $25 per night bar/restraunt credit badly designed.  Hard to believe it is really a Hilton.,Dec 28| 2018,1
We stayed from December 21st to the 25th & were booked across from Housekeeping.  In the morning| we were awakened by the cackling in the hallway outside our room by the Housekeepers reporting for work.  On the day that we were checking out| Housekeeping entered our room twice without waiting for us to answer her quick knock.  Check out is 12 noon and both times were before that.  Twice during this stay| the elevator stopped working.  No fun to have to walk up or down 9 flights of stairs.  And now I was charged 3 times on my credit card for the destination fee| I called the Hotel and was transferred from switchboard to front desk to accounting.  I left a message (their message says they will respond within 24 hours - NOT) & also sent an email to which I have also not received a reply.  Although this was my 3rd visit to this property| I'm not sure I would stay again.,Dec 27| 2018,3
Location is really good | prices for a breakfast buffet was to expensive at $50 per person | because of not choices a la carte ... when we just want it two eggs and coffee.. it’s a big hotel and elevators and check out time got really busy to take and huge waiting time,Dec 27| 2018,3
The service was poor.  Surly staff.  Bars| restaurant and grab and go place all understaffed.  We had awful service at each place. Really irritating that they automatically charge your gratuity and staff was terrible!  Great location| but the lack of service will prevent me from returning.!!,Dec 27| 2018,3
This hotel is huge and is a constant madhouse. We chose this hotel because of its proximity to the Radio City Rockettes. When we arrived there were probably 100 people in line to check in. We checked our bags and came back later and waited about 45 minutes in line. Our guest services guy was nice| but other than the valet and housekeeping the rest of staff are very unfriendly. The charge requiring you to eat or drink daily is absurd. Not having coffee makers in the room when you have to wait in line so long downstairs is not convenient. I felt faint from waiting so long for an elevator the morning of check out and sat at the closed bar where I was ran off by a very rude employee without a name tag. What harm is there in sitting at a closed bar when there were no other seats around? Not impressed with this Hilton hotel at all and will not stay again.,Dec 27| 2018,3
very nice but checkin line was long........................,Dec 27| 2018,5
Location super near shopping| entertainment | easy moving,Dec 27| 2018,4
We booked this Hotel for our Christmas Holiday. On arrival| the lobby was chaos with people everywhere trying to check-in. We had to wait for nearly 1-hour to check in and after a really long journey from the UK (and a 2 hour long queue at JFK airport security) we couldn’t wait to get to our room.  We stayed on floor 35 which has great views towards Central Park but our premium room was very basic with very little storage and no coffee/tea making facilities. The bathroom was small and ‘tired’ with a grubby-looking shower/bath. We had a King size bed and a sofa-bed for our son which wasn’t made up and we had to seek some bedding from housekeeping.  Considering we were staying at this hotel for Christmas (22nd-26th)| it would have been nice to have some festive deco in the rooms?!  Overall| the location is great but it’s the small things that let this hotel down. I would say it’s more 3-star than the 4 star rating it’s classed as.,Dec 27| 2018,2
The location was perfect and walking distance to all!,Dec 27| 2018,5
This hotel was in the perfect location for my trip. Rockefeller Center| Radio Center & Central Park are just minutes of this location. The only downside was that I checked in on Dec. 22 and while there were six employees working check in| only 2 were working for non Hilton Honors customers and the other 4 were working Hilton Honors. I feel like they could have split this up evenly to help accommodate the super long lines during check in/check out. Otherwise| this was a great stay. Would recommend!,Dec 26| 2018,5
Great Hotel and location ! Never had a problem this is my 2nd stay here !,Dec 26| 2018,5
Clean and great size room for NYC. When checking in| staff was not very friendly and just matter of fact. Also| other guests said they got free breakfast buffet tickets| but we didn’t get any. They said you had to ask for them.,Dec 26| 2018,4
Great location and very nice room. Size was much better than expected. Would definitely stay there again.,Dec 25| 2018,5
The only thing good is the location of the hotel . Staff was rude and unorganized,Dec 25| 2018,3
Loved the location| was close to lots of restaurants and time square and rockerfeller center were all within walking distance.,Dec 25| 2018,5
Excellent ubication| cleanless| comfort Antonio the staff,Dec 25| 2018,5
King Premium Skyline View Room with breakfast had an amazing view| really good breakfast and clean. Check in was long but expected with Christmas being the following day but Overall experience was great. Was celebrating a birthdays and all top notch restaurants minutes away and Times Square is walking distance.,Dec 25| 2018,5
comfortable. couple of suggestions:  more english and less chinese language newspapers. more umbrellas esp. with Hilto logo.  seating by the 2 and 3 fl  conf roooms,Dec 24| 2018,4
Big convention type hotel| so you have that feeling when you leave that you spent half of the visit waiting in line.  They definitely try to save $ on not enough people at the front desks| and have managers just come out and yell at that staff so that they are in a not so great mood when you are dealing with them.  I will pay another $75 a night and go a little more upscale on my next visit.  Wish I had not tried to save a few $.,Dec 24| 2018,2
The  check-in was not efficient. The room was smaller than I thought it would be. Breakfast was not bad.,Dec 24| 2018,1
The NY Hilton was a great place to stay with kids. Spacious lobby & rooms. Well kept & clean with friendly & helpful staff. Loved the fresh buffet breakfast & casual dining options. Had large tables to accommodate our group of 8. Nice and reasonably priced gift shop. Convenient location... close to many attractions. We really enjoyed it.,Dec 24| 2018,5
Great location and service. Close to Central Park| Times Square| Rockefeller Plaza| subway station. We will definitely consider to return un our next visit to New York,Dec 24| 2018,5
Check in took almost an hour. They gave us a king size bed instead of 2 doubles| they did compensate us for this though,Dec 24| 2018,3
The breakfast buffet was awesome.  Every one of the staff except  the coffee lady seemed genuinely interested and helpful.,Dec 24| 2018,5
Pros: Great location. Nice staff. Cons: TV is nice...system is ancient. Did not have hot water the first night we arrived. Elevator was broken on check-out day and had to take the stairs 7 flights down.,Dec 24| 2018,3
Amazing location| and staff is very friendly. Would stay again 100%.,Dec 24| 2018,5
Great location. Comfortable. Memory foam sofa bed kept our kids from complaining about an uncomfortable bed.,Dec 24| 2018,4
I normally stay at the Marriott Marquis when I come to NYC. This time I decided to stay at the Hitlon for convenience to Radio City on a rainy Friday.We tried to check in at 3:05.  Our room was not available but they said we could downgrade.  We opted to wait and come back in 2 hours.  We wanted use the hotel credits we paid for on a late lunch and drinks but because we did not have a room we could not charge them to a room. So we couldn’t use the credit we are forced to but.  We can back at 5:30 and were given room keys and told they could see what they could do about the charges.  Nothing has happened at this point to those charges a couple days later. We got to our room and the keys didn’t work.  Came back and stood in the holiday lines which we expected for a third time to find we were given the wrong room number.  We finally got to our room running late to get ready for Our Reservation to find not enough room towels. We made it work with  what we had.  We called 2 different times for towels and never received them.  I ended up going and finding housekeeping in a hallway and got 2 towels. In edition to all that the service in the bar and food areas was extremely slow and at times felt ignored. I am disappointed because I am a fan of Hilton as a whole but this experience was disappointing.,Dec 23| 2018,2
The unexpected destination deposit of $25/day which could be used against certain purchases at the hotel (but not breakfast in the dining room) seemed like a poorly concealed means of either increasing the daily room rate or forcing you to spend additional money in the hotel. Just like the airlines - extra unexpected charges that nickel and dime us to death! Otherwise| our stay was fine and the location is convenient.,Dec 23| 2018,3
Hotel was clean| excellent location| great service. Room was clean and comfortable.,Dec 23| 2018,5
We stayed in the executive suite and despite having executive suite privileges| out keycard didn’t allow us card access to these areas for the whole four days; instead we had to rely on staff being on duty at these places.Hotel was in the centre of everything| a short walk to Times Square in one direction and Central Park in the other. Despite the rain| it was easy to make our way around New York and still take tours because of the jitel’s central location.,Dec 23| 2018,4
Room didn’t have keurig or coffee maker. Everything space wise is tight| the bathroom too small. The bedsheets were old and seemed unclean,Dec 22| 2018,3
Hilton midtown used to be flagship hotel. No lobby decorations. Long lines check. No place sit and do business. Exec club was like a cafeteria. Hotel has been chopped up to retail and Hilton club. Very few amenities Room was nice and clean. Staff nice.,Dec 21| 2018,2
The location was great. The breakfast buffet was wonderful! The sad part about our stay was check out. It was horrendous! We stood on line for a half hour with only two desks open on one if the busiest days of the year.!!!!,Dec 21| 2018,4
No fail hotel. Been coming here for the last decade both for leaisre and business.,Dec 21| 2018,5
I didn’t like that there was no ice or vending machines on each floor.Loved location and room size was bigger than most New York hotels.,Dec 20| 2018,4
Great location| charged to get into room before checkin time.,Dec 20| 2018,4
Great hotel within walking distance to all things NY.,Dec 19| 2018,5
Perfect place to go if you want to be within walking distance to Broadway| Central Park| Rockefeller Center| Times Square (which is basically Broadway)| and everything else that you could want to do. Highly recommend| especially with great staff and perks like credits for drinks and purchases at their in house snack store.,Dec 19| 2018,5
Great location| excellent service. Dedicated staff| close to everything.,Dec 19| 2018,5
Perfect location and great price for what you get.  The rooms were large clean and comfortable.  The breakfast was spectacular.  The parking option was extremely expensive,Dec 19| 2018,5
It is a great location| with in a 5 minute walk to Radio City Music Hall,Dec 18| 2018,5
This hotel is the perfect location to walk to Rockefeller Center| Times Square| Radio City| and great shopping. Staff was so helpful and breakfast was delicious. Valet service also very easy to use...we did up and down service when we needed to check out but weren’t ready to leave the city. The valet brought down the vehicle| loaded our bags| then took it back into the garage.,Dec 18| 2018,5
The registration service was excellent. They accommodated any request with prompt and courteous service,Dec 15| 2018,5
Very busy hotel in a great location.  Staff always friendly and helpful.  Breakfast very good and the use of the Executive Lounge a great advantage.This is our second visit to the Hilton Midtown and would definitely like to stay in the future.,Dec 12| 2018,5
The valet parking person stole my iPhone usb chargers|that is really low considering is only $20 besides that it was okay..,Dec 10| 2018,3
Great location| beautiful hotel| great staff; however room was not expected.  The floor in  bathroom became flooded with water and did not drain well due to a flat shower floor.,Dec 10| 2018,4
The ceiling was falling in our room and there was food left on the counters.,Dec 9| 2018,2
Park before checking in as there is no space to stand at the 6th Ave. entrance.,Dec 8| 2018,2
Great location and close to many sites|  Hotel staff was friendly and helpful.,Dec 8| 2018,4
It took 40 minutes to check in on arrivalFor 600/night I expect a better room and breakfast service. Staff was not especially friendly or helpful.,Dec 8| 2018,1
Very convenient location and check in was very prompt.,Dec 7| 2018,4
The wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling apart at the seams. At almost$500 per night| I was surprised at this.,Dec 4| 2018,4
Nice location. Moderate price for Manhattan,Dec 3| 2018,4
Below expectations. It took three days for the hotel to finally send somebody to fix the TV set. (It took 5 minutes for the technician to fix the issue). One day the room was not cleaned| we had to call at 8pm. It does not have a good restaurant. Wi-Fi was terrible.,Dec 2| 2018,3
It was centrally located in Manhattan very clean a nice work out room,Dec 2| 2018,5
It was amazing hotel! The staff took great care of us.,Dec 2| 2018,5
Wonderful experience. Very good accommodations. The refrigerator in my room was not working. I think it was room 2821. You may need to have it repaired! Thank you!!,Dec 1| 2018,5
Room was outdated. Bathroom had wallpaper coming off the walls| rust building up and just unclean look. Food in the bar was terrible| prepped already beforehand - e.g. bread already toasted and put in the fridge together with fresh meat and then served cold...,Dec 1| 2018,2
The location is excellent and it is very convenient that it has a great place for take out food right in the lobby. The bar is impossible to get into as it is very small. The internet service is extremely poor so if wifi is important this is not a good hotel to stay. The rooms however are very large and comfortable.,Nov 30| 2018,4
Great location and good amenities.  Super crowded for holiday weekend| but that is to be expected.,Nov 29| 2018,4
Excellent place to stay in Mid Town Manhattan! Quite a central location for business as well as for quality entertainment,Nov 29| 2018,5
Location of hotel is really perfect. Room was big for NY Standards but cost per night was outrageous for just a standard room. WiFi did not work.,Nov 29| 2018,4
Average amenities- nothing too fancy. Had 2 rooms| a was told at registration counter at 5:30 pm| one was not clean yet. Had to check into one room and did not get into other room until hours later. I would think that if a room is not available at 5:30 pm| some credit should be given.,Nov 27| 2018,3
Our room 2622 was large but very loud from elevators even though we weren't that close. Bar was dirty and service took forever. One of our key cards didn't work and when we went downstairs the gentleman at the desk was very| very rude.,Nov 26| 2018,3
We had a great stay at the Hilton Midtown!  Took my teenage girls into the city for a girls weekend.  The hotel was clean| great location and the staff was excellent.  My expedia deal came with free breakfast| which was great - big buffet with all the fixin's.  I will definitely stay here again!,Nov 26| 2018,5
Great hotel in Manhattan. Close to Times Square. Spacious rooms| good service. I recommend it for both business and pleasure ...,Nov 26| 2018,5
Hotel was great !,Nov 25| 2018,5
Stinky bath room,Nov 24| 2018,2

Clean hotel.,Nov 21| 2018,4
It was great,Nov 19| 2018,5
excellent location staff was terrificgrab and go amenities a nice touch,Nov 19| 2018,5
Nice sized rooms| comfortable beds | great location !!,Nov 19| 2018,5
lots of food and drink option right in hotel and plenty of space to relax with friends.,Nov 18| 2018,5
I love everything about this place. The only problem was they didn’t have enough stuff members to help out with checking in and checking out. We had to stand in line to just get our room keys| we have checked in in the morning but rooms were not ready and when we came back around 4:00 we had to stand in the same line that people who were checking in. That could manage that differently| they also didn’t aware us about discount for restaurant that we were in title for staying in the hotel.,Nov 17| 2018,5
Tiny| awkward room for $500 a night. Staff was rude. Mini queen bed. Eill never stay here again on business.,Nov 17| 2018,2
Good location. Bad service. Poor breakfast. It is not at Hilton’s level,Nov 16| 2018,3
Great location| very good room size. Clean and comfortable room,Nov 14| 2018,5
This hotel worked out perfectly for our one night stay in New York. The location was great and the room was perfect for the 6 of us!,Nov 14| 2018,5
Stayed because we were seeing Elton John at the Garden.  Hotel was great.  My only slight complaint is that only the lounge bar was open during the afternoon.  You should open up the one behind the elevators - its much more comfortable.,Nov 14| 2018,4
Convenient location. Close to everything. The only complaint is that The towels were a little hard.,Nov 13| 2018,4
I love Hilton hotels good experience with the benefits and services and friendly staffs,Nov 12| 2018,5
First and foremost| we had an amazing time staying out your Hotel. Mei at the front desk was the best! The only suggestions I will give you is if you are going to have a refrigerator in the rooms- you should always have a microwave in the same room. We needed a microwave and didn't have one to heat up our leftovers. Another suggestion - the bathroom downstairs near the luggage storage was used as a changing room. I stood in a line for 10 minutes to use the bathroom. After entering the bathroom - I saw young college students using the restroom only to change. They took up the stalls for this and that wasn't fair. You should make 1 stall for changing or post a note stating that they have to use another facility for that.,Nov 12| 2018,4
very nice and classy| and close to everything!We loved our stay there.,Nov 12| 2018,5
I had read this hote was renovated in 2015....  certainly not our room.  Relatively clean but pretty dated and worn out.  Comfortable beds and bedding.  Small bathroom with a closet the same size as the bathroom which seems kind of useless in a hotel room...should’ve taken some room from the huge closet to make the bathroom easier to move around.  And no coffee maker ???  Maybe because it’s NYC but we’ve never been to a hotel room without a coffee maker...,Nov 12| 2018,3
Overall good! Great location and comfy room| however| you can hear the elevators in the room which is a bit annoying.,Nov 12| 2018,4
Great location ! Convenient ! Accessible to great restaurants and shows,Nov 12| 2018,5
Nice hotel close to central park.  The breakfast food was great although a little slow with the coffee.  A bar is conveniently located on the first floor and is not too loud even when there is a decent crowd.  The staff was very attentive and friendly.,Nov 11| 2018,5
Always enjoy staying at this hotel! Staff are efficient and friendly and the facilities are excellent,Nov 9| 2018,4
We loved the Midtown Hilton. It was close to Central Park so we could walk our dog there & it’s also walking distance to Times Square & Rockefeller Center.  The room was spacious and the bed was super comfortable. We would definitely stay here on our next trip to NYC.,Nov 8| 2018,5
very good location to reach out mid and upper town.,Nov 7| 2018,4
I requested two cups of  hot water for my baby for his formula| and the employee in the Herb'n Kitchen gave me a hard time at every evening. I said I can pay for it. He told me that I can not buy hot water because hot water is included| but he still refused to provide enough hot water for me. I explained to him that for my baby's formula| and I needed it. He finally reluctant to provide the hot water with very rude attitude. He even asked me to step aside because he had more important customer  that lined up after me to check out. I should be treated like this and hope Hilton the 5-start hotel can take a action.,Nov 6| 2018,1
Thank you |it was very nice |good work|selection|and rates,Nov 6| 2018,5
I booked a 2 night stay| that had one confirmation number for the reservation. The reservation was referred to as a "2 part" reservation because one night was a non-refundable rate. The hotel somehow considered this two 1-night reservations| so at 655pm on my 2nd night at the hotel| they called me and I had to pack up all my belongings and go downstairs| stand in line| and check in again| to another room. I have no idea what they would have done| if I had been gone| which I was going to be in another 30 minutes. Unbelievable experience. Their excuse was that they had promised that end of the floor to a group. How did they not figure it out until 655pm? I would be interested to know if hotels.com did indeed send them two 1-night reservations| even though my confirmation showed one 2-night reservation. I was going to extend for a 3rd night| but after that I went to a different hotel.,Nov 6| 2018,3
Room was small but comfortable for three adults traveling with a baby. The hotel nickels and dimes for a lot of stuff though - sign up for the Hilton Honors loyalty program to get around some of this.,Nov 4| 2018,4
Nice Hotel in good location close to Times Square and Central Park.,Oct 30| 2018,4
The room was nice and clean. My only complaint was that my room was near the elevator and all I could hear was the elevator going up and down all night. I requested a different room and they honored my request without any questions.,Oct 30| 2018,4
We had an average room| nothing fancy or over the top. The mattress was decent to get a good nights rest on| and we really enjoyed the bathrooms mirror with the lighting behind it that was perfect for getting ready. It was sometimes very noisy in the hallways just outside our room; sometimes it was other guests and sometimes it was the hotel service. Overall| we thought the value of this hotel and the location we were in was great and well worth it. You are right down the road from St. Patrick’s and Rockefeller Centre. As well as a quick walk to restaurants and shopping. There are a couple of subway stops nearby so you can conveniently travel elsewhere in the city. We would stay again!,Oct 29| 2018,4
First time staying at a Hilton Hotel. Wonderful room| good breakfast| fabulous location.One think| no mini bar or coffee supplies.Bath products was very good.,Oct 29| 2018,5
Nice hotel| very friendly staff. My 2nd stay there. The only downside was the travel advice desk| which gave us BAD advice| which turned out to be a scam. We did complain but the chap we saw was very dismissive. We spoke to a fellow guest who also had the same experience so we kept telling other guests to stay away from the advice desk.,Oct 29| 2018,4
It took hours to check in. No one was directing anyone and additionally| we had to be somewhere in an 1:30 and they wouldn’t let us check our bags. We unfortunately had to miss our resevation,Oct 29| 2018,2
Outstanding customer service from check in to check out.  Staff was accommodating and polite.  Room was clean and spacious.  It is a busy hotel though.  Hotel lobby very noisy and elevators always crowded but once you get to your floor all was cool.  Would stay again.,Oct 27| 2018,4
For such a big hotel this was a good one.  The AC was not obnoxious and the hotel was modern| clean and comfortable.,Oct 24| 2018,4
Nice hotel  Nice hotel Nice hotel Nice hotel Nice hotel,Oct 24| 2018,5
Nice hotel in convenient location.  Easy to get to plays and restaurants.,Oct 23| 2018,5
Deli food options in lobby area open till midnight. This gives opportunity for healthy food late at night without sitting in a restaurant,Oct 23| 2018,4
Zero palatable food options at hotel and room service food was simply awful.,Oct 22| 2018,3
This is an expensive hotel but you get what you pay for with the location and amenities. We splurged for our honeymoon and were very comfortable. It was in a great location and we thoroughly enjoyed our time at this hotel!,Oct 21| 2018,4
Large reliable hotel in midtown near shopping and theatres.,Oct 21| 2018,4
This place is great with two caveats:1- Expect very long lineups during check-in and check-out (check-out is not automated like other Hilton locations).2- The prices at the bar are outrageous. I had two rum and cokes and it was close to $40 USD with the tip they add on automatically and other strange fees. Go to any bar a block away and it will be half this or less.,Oct 19| 2018,4
No room service| no coffee machines in rook- overpriced "deli" in lobby. Slow running elevators that were overcrowded and long wait times. Horrible value for the money,Oct 19| 2018,2
Check-in always takes a while here| but this time it was 20 mins plus| and staff appeared to be wandering around the lobby handing out water rather than checking people in? The $25 per day "urban destination charge" UDC was not explained to me upon check-in| and so I ended up with an extra $100 hidden charge on my bill. The UDC charge is a fundamental rip-off anyway -- as a Hilton Honors member I already get the free wifi| nearly every hotel offers free local phone calls| and if I want to spend money on food in the hotel| I would rather do it on my own terms. Shame on you Hilton for trying to extract more money from (one-time) loyal guests.Every interaction was staff here was horrendous| from the bad check-in to the "you're good" check out (no| "how was your stay?"| or "thank you"). I tried to complain a couple of times about the urban destination charge| but was ignored| with an email saying that my complaint had been resolved? My room key also stopped working at one point| and after queueing 10+ mins at reception to get this fixed| the staff member said nothing other than it was now fixed -- no apology...The location of the hotel is good| but that's where the benefits end. The hotel is expensive| with hidden charges from $25 p/d UDC| $5 per piece of left luggage when checking out| and no coffee/tea in the room (and a $4 cost in the lobby coffee shop). The staff are no where near the level I would expect. I won't be staying here again for quite some time...,Oct 16| 2018,1
Was a little outdated... would be great if it gets renovated...,Oct 15| 2018,3
The grumpy man at the counter was not a nice welcome at 3 am after a long day of travel. They gave away my room after I had called to let them know of our late arrival| and the man “helping” me could have cared less.  The next day when I had to change rooms the check in line was about 30 minutes long.  I had to interrupt one of my 3 days there with my son to stand in line to get my room changed which should have been right in the first place.  No upgrade or compensation was offered.  I won’t stay here again.,Oct 15| 2018,3
Room was very noisy there were motores running somewhere else in the hall or the floor above all night very hard to get to sleep. Sink was very slow draining. Room was clean and in good condition other wise.,Oct 15| 2018,3
Attractive room and common areas.  Bar service was slow and prices were high by even New York standards,Oct 14| 2018,3
Good location| comfortable and clean hotel.,Oct 13| 2018,4
Room service was knocking on the door everyday around 8:30. Overall it's nice| but for the price of it they should invest into some new furniture...,Oct 12| 2018,4
Room was clean and neat and right across the street from my client,Oct 11| 2018,5
the hotel is fine| there is a lot of line to have breakfast| you have to wait more than 30 min. the grab and go is fine| it's a bit expensive.,Oct 11| 2018,3

The hotel was very good| a little bit old in the decor and it feels like a very used hotel| with a little bit of the infrastructure in need for replacement. The fitness center was very very good| with plenty of machines and space to weight train and stretch.  The staff were very courteous and the breakfast setting was great.  The area is very convenient with both Central Park| and Times Square only a few blocks away.  We got a great deal on hotels.com with breakfast| so aim for that if possible.,Oct 6| 2018,4
The hotel was great as far as check-in and my room was clean. I arrived late at almost midnight and was given a room on the 49th floor. My only request was a quiet room away from the elevator. So...of course my room was right next to the elevator! I was too exhausted to haul myself down to the front desk with my luggage so just sucked it up and stayed there. The room was also next to a supply closet which staff accessed at 1:30am while chatting loudly in the hallway. Otherwise the hotel is great and well situated. Beware...Overnight parking was $75!!,Oct 4| 2018,4
Nati at the front desk was excellent. The continental breakfast at the executive lounge was very good and convenient. The executive lounge overall was great. The hotel location was also very convenient.,Oct 3| 2018,5

Otherwise the hotel is great and well situated. Beware...Overnight parking was $75!!,Oct 4| 2018,4
Nati at the front desk was excellent. The continental breakfast at the executive lounge was very good and convenient. The executive lounge overall was great. The hotel location was also very convenient.,Oct 3| 2018,5
Hotel was clean and felt safe because you needed room card to get into the building,Oct 3| 2018,5
very clean comfortable to get around  staff friendly for the most part,Oct 2| 2018,5
Hilton Midtown is so close to so many attractions. Easy to get subways to other locations. A great place to stay!,Oct 2| 2018,4
Location was great.  Easy walk to different venues| and Grand Central Station. Lobby and common areas were nice.  Our floor was quite dated with peeling wallpaper down the halls.  Rooms had not been remodeled since  the 1990's. A very basic pared down room.  Cleaning  and maintenance staff was A+.,Sep 24| 2018,3
The rooms were big| though the air conditioning did not stay cold even after 2 calls and a tech in the room. The overall friendliness of everyone added to the stay| though if you do stay park somewhere else||...$$$$$$$$,Sep 24| 2018,4
The line to check in was over 45 minutes long.It costs money PER bag that you ask the concierge to hold. Nowhere to buy phone charger,Sep 24| 2018,3
Wonderful stay with lovely breakfast| bed very comfortable|room could have a bigger wardrobe| no line in bathroom for drying clothes| they charge $5 USD to store each bag after checkout and no where to freshen up while waiting for a late night flight.,Sep 24| 2018,4
Perfect location! Room is very comfortable. Concierge Desk provides Broadway tickets. Got free upgrade. Free wi-fi. Resort fee of $25 a day gives you $15/$10 lounge/kitchen items to spend. 55" flat screen TV in the room with premium TV channels. Still trying to figure out what the "Hilton Club" is. Breakfast at the Herb N Kitchen is great! Cold and hot dishes with fruits| omelette cook station. Big spread of breakfast items.,Sep 24| 2018,5
Overall a typical Hilton. Clean| updated| fine.  Good amenities on the main level.,Sep 23| 2018,4
It was fine.  Convenient to many points of interest.,Sep 22| 2018,4
Walking distance to times square and easy for the subway! Awesome locations| great rooms. Would definitely stay here again!,Sep 22| 2018,5
The room was spacious by New York standards and close to where we needed to be.  It was extremely well maintained and staff was able to help quickly when we needed something.,Sep 20| 2018,5
Location is very nice| we love it. It just the customer service can be improved more.,Sep 18| 2018,4
This hotel is wonderfully located| and the staff is super friendly. The Herb ‘N Kitchen is very convenient and the food is good The only downside is the bar. $18 for a Manhattan I expect in NYC| but made with Jim Beam| swimming with ice chips| and a cherry that belonged on an ice cream Sunday? Ridiculous.,Sep 18| 2018,4
Perfectly centralized giving access to a lot by walking short distances.,Sep 17| 2018,5
The Hotel charged us $25 a day for an "Urban Destination Charge"... but when we checked in the young lady said that we could charge up to $25 a day in the bar or Herb N Kitchen and that would credit off the $25 charge.  We were very specific and asked her if we could do it all in the bar| all in the Kitchen| and all in one day i.e. $100 in one day which would cover our 4-night stay charge.  However when we checked out| we were told that we could only charge $10 in the Kitchen and $15 in the Bar.  Again| we specifically asked this question previously| but they made no effort to correct their error.  I realize this is NY| but that doesn't mean you have to put up with overcharges and lying.   Won't be staying there next trip.,Sep 16| 2018,2
Great location and friendly staff.  It’s a big hotel| but that’s fine.  A big room by NY standards.,Sep 16| 2018,4
Spent a few days here for our engagement.  Excellent hotel. Actually upgraded us and sent champagne to the room!!! Nice touch Hilton.,Sep 16| 2018,5
Nice facility centrally located in mid town.,Sep 10| 2018,5
It’s more of a business hotel .. the location is ideal .. but I was expecting more from house keeping and other services ..,Sep 10| 2018,3
The only thing I really did not like was having my do not disturb sign on the door and housekeeping still came into my room while I was out! Definitely an invasion of privacy!,Sep 10| 2018,4
rooms not clean| dust down side of cupboards |filthy bath,Sep 9| 2018,3
Not really a 4 star like people who are rated for does not have a tooth brush and tooth paste in the bathroom and ......,Sep 9| 2018,3

Fantastic location in the heart of midtown Manhattan. The per diem for coffee was a nice touch.,Sep 6| 2018,4

I am a Hilton honors rewards member| and they do not want to honor my stay| and give me my reward points for my stay.  In addition they charged an additional mandatory charge for room incidental which I normally do not use.  Forcing me to buy products in the hotel.,Sep 2| 2018,2
Very nice hotel| large rooms ideal for families| very good breakfast,Sep 2| 2018,4
Perfect location! Great staff and clean hotel . Always stay at the Midtown Hilton Hotel.,Sep 2| 2018,5
Over priced| dated and needs updating. Bathroom very poor standard for a ahilton hotel.,Sep 1| 2018,3
Centrally located in Manhattan to Times Square| near Central Park.,Sep 1| 2018,4
Washrooms were not the best and they charge there customers for holding your suitcases when you leave this never happened to me in any other hotel in New York,Sep 1| 2018,3
Changed rooms twice. Booked into wrong room type to start with. The second room smelled stale. They charged me an extra 25/day claiming it state mandated and they giving me extras I don’t need for it. I felt violated.,Sep 1| 2018,1
Great service and location!(Your 50 character minimum is very very very silly Expedia!),Sep 1| 2018,5
Very good enough.,Aug 31| 2018,5
This property was minutes away from a business customer and was very convenient to this business trip.,Aug 31| 2018,4
I had to help get my daughter into her apt - she will be studying at NYU.  The breakfast was fantastic and the room was great.  It was safe and there were lots of families there.,Aug 28| 2018,5
Very long line to eat breakfast in the morning.  Property was ok,Aug 28| 2018,3
Good| inexpensive midtown hotel well located for exploring NYC.  A little tired but reflected in the price.,Aug 28| 2018,4
No complementary breakfast but $15 a day off at the eatery off the lobby.  The hotel is centrally located. The mini fridge was missing from the room| so we called to have one delivered.,Aug 28| 2018,4
It was good I need to know any deal or promotions for starting in L.A,Aug 27| 2018,5
The location of the hotel is amazing.  Walking distance to Time square and Central Park and many more tourist attractions.  Would Stay here again.  Our room was a little dated but very clean and comfortable.  Staff were amazing.,Aug 27| 2018,4
The experience was slightly ruined when the hotel "lost" our luggage after we had put it in storage in the reception area on our arrival. In the end we had to go to the storage area and find it ourselves. Not the end of the world| but it caused quite a bit of stress !! The hotel staff during this episode were not very helpful| knowledgeable| sorry or anything that could be seen as efficient. Once this was sorted the hotel seemed ok. In particular| the staff in the bar were amazingly friendly and enhanced our stay.,Aug 25| 2018,3
Very satisfied. Breakfast is fantastic.,Aug 25| 2018,4
I will be back here next year! So closed to 5th Ave.| Central park and Time square,Aug 24| 2018,4
The location is fantastic! It’s close to Times Square | 5th avenue| radio city. Empire State| Rockefeller| grand central. All within walking distance. However if you’ve had a late night be prepared to be disturbed early in the morning when housekeeping are making their rounds. They are loud and will wake you :(,Aug 23| 2018,4
Good til last night.  Woke at 12:30 am to strong smell of pot.  Not sure what to do| so endured it.  Had to get up at 3 am to go to airport so did not appreciate the smell waking all of us.  2 or 3 machines in the fitness area were also broken.,Aug 19| 2018,4
Hotel was fine and location was great.  Hotel staff was very friendly. Room was also larger than most NY hotels near the theater district.,Aug 17| 2018,5
The room was spacious| especially for New York| and the location was incredible! We were just a couple of blocks from Central Park| shopping on Fifth Avenue| and Times Square. The staff was gracious and accommodating. Everything was perfect- we will stay here again.,Aug 17| 2018,5
Het hotel is een beetje gedateerd een renovatie van de kamers zou op z'n plaats zijn. Het was wel allemaal schoon en netjes. ligging was ook goed dichtbij veel bezienswaardigheden.,Feb 4| 2020,4
Muy buena opción considerando costo/beneficio. Gran ubicación.,Jan 30| 2020,4
El hotel es standard. No tiene ningún servicio en el cuarto como cafetera. Te cobran un resort fee . Yo había reservado una habitación con dos camas y no tenían | así que me dieron la “alternativa” de un cuarto con king size y un sofá cama . Al aceptar me llevaron sábanas y me dijeron que tenía que hacer mi propia cama del sofá . Me parece inaceptable .,Jan 11| 2020,3
リゾート料金1日30ドルの他に、強制的にデポジットを500ドル取られ、使わないなら返すと言うのならわかりますが、強制的に1日につき30ドルを没収されてしまいます。7日間で210ドルをリゾート料金210ドル以外に募集される。詐欺と同じやり方。募集されるくらいなら、210ドルは強制的にホテルで飲み食いしろと。ふざけるなと思います。そして、真冬のニューヨーク。エアコンから冷たい風が出るので、直してくれと言っても、結局7日間治らず、寒いまま。最悪です。おまけにチェックアウト時、レシートをくれと言ってるのに、くれないのでおかしいなと思っていたら、カードを預けて、1日60ドルも取られているのに、さらにクレジットカードも提示を求め、リゾート料金を払えと言ってきました。ダブルで取ろうとしている詐欺師軍団。本当にふざけてる。,Jan 10| 2020,1
Todo estuvo muy bien habitaciones y el hotel en general Exelente| ubicación magnífica,Jan 7| 2020,5

Upon arrival our daughter's bed was not made up. Old |worn out rooms. Absence of cleaning and vacuuming the dirtiest carpets we've ever seen in a $400 per day hotel. Found contact lenses from previous customers left by the window.They are still there.... We had to ask for sheets to get changed otherwise the staff does not do it.In short cleaning means just making up the beds.,Jan 5| 2020,2

立地が良くていいかと思ってヒルトンミッドタウンを選びました。清潔感があって、落ち着いた雰囲気でよかったです。ただ、部屋には歯ブラシも、スリッパや湯沸かしポットやお茶類もありませんでした。湯沸かしポットは言って持ってきてもらいました。他もリクエストしたら、持って来てくれたのかもしれませんが。バスタブの排水溝の流れが悪いのは伝えたところ見てくれたようだすが直りませんでした。作りが古いので、設備は仕方ないところでしょうか。受付や他のスタッフさんも感じがよく、丁寧に説明してくれたので、その辺はとてもよかったです。ニューヨークは、思っていた以上に地下鉄とバスが便利で行動できるので、クリスマスシーズンのお高い料金を考えると、立地が多少悪くても、他のホテルでもよかったのかとも思いました。日本語を話せるスタッフさんには会いませんでした。,Dec 31| 2019,3
Me gusto todo lo que califique como excelente. No me gusto la excesiva espera para el check in y los precios altos del desayuno,Dec 30| 2019,4
Esta súper bien ubicado y aunque está remodelado sigue requiriendo mantenimiento. No me grato que nos quisieran vender el servicio de desayuno. Lo que tiene muy bien es la tienda con comida para llevar. Saludos,Dec 29| 2019,4

Hotel tres central proche de tout. C'est un grand avantage dans une si grande ville. Service de qualité. Chambre et salle de bains spatieuses. Le moins aimé : la cuisine du restaurant + les prix élevés quoique c'est général à NY) l'éclairage trop faible de la chambre.,Oct 1| 2019,3

シャワーの使い方がわからず数十分格闘し、フロントにその旨を伝えたら、直ぐにスタッフを部屋に、ということでしてので、部屋で待つこと数十分！それでも来なくて、フロントに電話したところ、またまた来なくて電話、それでも来ませんでした。仕方なく、あれやこれや格闘しやっとはいることができました。フロントが悪いのか、スタッフが悪いのか！日中出掛けて、部屋に戻ってみると、トイレットペーパーの予備が置いてありませんでした。使いかけは半分弱になっていたので、風呂のけんもあり、スタッフに言ってもダメだろうなと不安でした。翌日は補助を置いてくれるように、チップと一緒にメモを置いておきました。,Sep 10| 2019,2

La habitación que nos tocó era muy grande| con una cama extra y super cómoda| el baño con una ducha enorme y muy limpio| al igual que la habitación muy limpia. Las vistas no eran increíbles pero estábamos en una planta alta y se veían todos los edificios de alrededor  desde los grandes ventanales de la habitación. Ubicación inmejorable en el Midtown| super cerca del metro| para poder ir venir del aeropuerto sin problemas y moverte por la ciudad. A un paseo super agradable de Central Park| de Times Squeare| del Rockefeler| de todo! Ojalá pudiera repetir una y mil veces en este hotel.,Aug 24| 2019,5

ニューヨークは4回目、ヒルトン滞在は2回目でした。過去、他にも2つのホテルに滞在したことがありますが、やはり安定のヒルトン！という感想です。キングサイズベッド1台のお部屋でしたが、大きなトランクを同時に2つ開くことができます。現地ツアーの集合場所がホテル内1階であり（JTBオフィスはホテル内、HISも徒歩15分くらいの距離にあります（直進、1回左折、また直進で到着））、ホテル内の売店ではサンドイッチ、サラダ、スープやフルーツを好きな時間に買うことができ、NHKを見ることもできます。また、ブロードウェイやMETオペラは徒歩10分、ホールフーズやフードコートには徒歩10分かからずに行くことができます。地下鉄もいくつかの路線駅がすぐ近くにあるため、移動するにもとても便利です。次からは、迷わずヒルトンを選ぼうと思っています。,May 18| 2019,5
Hotellet er rent| men fremstår slitt. Hadde forventet mer ift. prisen. Det som irriterte meg mest var alle tilleggsutgiftene som det ikke ble godt nok opplyst om på forhånd. Jeg måtte betale 120 USD i resortavgift i tillegg til bestillingsprisen. Det er tilleggsavgift for wifi og for at de skal oppbevare bagasjen i noen timer (5 USD per item). Hotellet ligger sentralt. Vil virkelig anbefale rom høyt oppe ettersom det er mye støy fra utrykningskjøretøy døgnet rundt nærmere gateplan.,May 16| 2019,1
Extrêmement bien placé (Transports| restos| lieux à visiter)| propre et moderne.Si je reviens à New York| j'irai de nouveau au Hilton Midtown...,May 14| 2019,5
ホテルは多少古い感じはするものの、部屋は清潔です。部屋にはドライヤーはあるものの、日本のように冷蔵庫やアメニティはありません。場所はセントラルパーク、５TH Ave.、タイムズスクウェア等へ徒歩圏内で、アクセスが非常に良いうえ、ホテルの裏にはデリもあるので、ちょっとした食事も可能です。またNY旅行の際は利用したいと思います。,May 13| 2019,4

Questo Hilton non è buono! Altri forse si ma questo lasciamolo stare. Si capisce che| siccome è troppo grosso e ci sono un mare di clienti non riescono a curarlo come si deve| non riescono a gestirlo da 4 stelle. Tra l’altro cara Expedia (e questo mi è già accaduto in altro hotel e non solo su questo Hilton)| vorrei capire come mai prenoto camere per tre persone (adulti e bambini) e mi ritrovo dei letti per due persone (in questo caso addirittura per 1 persona e 1/2 nel letto queen). Dovevo avere letto King e vi ho anche telefonato per assicurami che ci fossero i letti sufficienti perché mi era già capitato questo problema e mi riferite di stare tranquillo e poi dopo un viaggio di 15 ore dobbiamo dormire in 3 persone in un mezzo letto? Poi all’Hilton mi raccontano che forse non ci faranno pagare una camera. Ma come siamo messi?,Apr 27| 2019,2

관광하기 좋은 위치와 여러가지 편의시설로 사용하기는 편하다.하지만...호텔 숙박비 이외로 어메너티 사용을 해야 하는데...총 세금포함 30달러를 일박에 내야한다.물론 n.kitchen에서 10달러| 로비라운지에서 15달러 사용할수 있는 티켓이지만...라운지와 바 이용시간은 한정되어 있고...(특히 일요일)아침조식하고 나면 여행을 하기 때문에 사용할 시간이 없어서...2박을 한 우리는 고스란히 60달러를 그냥 낭비할 수 밖에 없었다.,Feb 14| 2019,3
Apenas a lamentar que não haja um lounge. Nenhum lugar pra sentar| esperar ou mesmo ficar depois do check out,Feb 13| 2019,4
La habitación que nos asignaron era pequeña pero lo suficientemente grande para dos personas. Las personas de intendencia son un poco descuidadas y dejan objetos de mas o no te dan lo necesario (jabon| shampoo| etc).

Viajamos em família e no momento do check in fizeram uma bagunça geral por conta de nosso sobrenome. Quartos reservados por outro aplicativo vieram parar com a gente que fez pelo hoteis.com. Mesmo mostrando a reserva e o número da mesma. Muita gente para check in e a atendente simplesmente mandou a gente sair da fila pois nao poderia autorizar nossa entrada pois pra ela a diária nao aparecia como paga. Somente com muita espera entramos no quarto e na hora do check out ainda foi outra confusão mas tudo resolvido. Fica nosso descontentamento por conta da recepcionista que nos atendeu no check in e não entendeu nossa situação e foi grosseira conosco. Uma reserva totalmente paga e o horário de entrada no hotel respeitada por nós que era pra ser as 15 horas foi perto das 21 horas. Descaso e falta de consideração. O quarto é excelente porem nao conseguimos entrar de manhã no hotel e ficamos ate 21 horas para poder tomar um banho e descansar.,Jan 1| 2019,3
personne ne parle français à la réception ! un hôtel de cette catégorie devrait avoir du personnel parlant plusieurs langues. Si je n'avais pas cherché moi-même j'aurais payé le wifi alors qu'il était inclus dans mon tarif. Compte tenu du montant journalier| ça fait une dépense non négligeable. Quand au petit déjeuner| l'interprète m'a assuré qu'il était compris dans mon tarif| or il ne l'était pas... cependant l'hotel n'a pas facturé le premier (et unique) petit déjeuner (et heureusement). A part cela| hôtel propre| chambre spacieuse et prestations/services parfaits.,Jan 1| 2019,3

Das Hotel liegt optimal in der Nähe vom Times Square und vom Central Park. Die Zimmer sind für New Yorker Verhältnisse relativ groß. Dass man zusätzlich 25 Dollar pro Tag zahlen muss| ist etwas ungewöhnlich und wenn man nicht direkt genau liest unangenehm| aber immerhin bekommt man das an der Hotelbar bzw. im Shop als Gutschrift (15 und 10 - man muss das System nur verstehen| dann passt das.

ロケーションは抜群ですが、施設は老朽化していて施設もサービスも高級感はありません。室内にはポットやコーヒー、ミネラルウォーターのボトルなども無く、備品は最小限です。低層階の部屋で１泊45000円以上したため、期待していたのですが残念です。このレートには見合わない施設です。あとでわかったのですが、１泊25000円程度の時期もあるようで、それならばこの立地を考えれば、お得感があると思いますが。,Nov 20| 2018,3

El hotel es un típico edificio de la cadena| con lobby| bar| y habitación muy similar a los de la cadena.El detalle fundamental es la ubicación: está a pasos de Central Park y a pocas cuadras de Times Square.Las habitaciones prolijas y limpias (aunque el día que llegué| tenía el cesto de basura lleno de cosas ¿?).Las pocas veces que me acerqué la Conserjería o a mostrador| me atendieron muy cordiales.Respecto a las propuestas gastronómicas| cuenta con un bar en el lobby con muy buena atención.Y detrás de los ascensores| cuenta con otro bar... pero con no tan buena atención...Salvando esos detalles| muy recomendable!,Oct 17| 2018,4

La ubicación es inmejorable para recorrer Midtown a pie| a una cuadra de la 5a Avenida. A 2 cuadras de Rockefeller Center. A 5 cuadras de Central Park| a 5 cuadras de Times square| de Bryant Park y de los teatros.Para distancias mayores hay estaciones de Subway a 1 y 3 cuadras.El hotel es muy grande| muy bonito y funcional. Las habitaciones son un poco pequeñas y sin mucho lujo| pero tiene lo necesario para descansar.Tiene express checkout que es sumamente práctico.Vale la pena. Mi próxima estancia buscaré este mismo hotel.,Oct 10| 2018,5
Anika nos recibió y nos entregó la peor de las habitaciones del hotel| polvosa| con moho en la parte baja de la cortina del baño y muy estrecha. Bajé a la recepción ese día y esta persona nos dio a entender que era lo que teníamos contratado directamente con Expedia :( Que no tenía otra habitación y que si quería fuera al día siguiente después de las 3 de la tarde a ver si tenía otra habitación para cambiarnos. Después de una terrible y alérgica noche (por el polvo)| bajé a la recepción y Sanjay me atendió con MUCHA amabilidad y disposición y nos cambió a una habitación limpia y sin moho. La actitud y disposición de quien nos atendió fue muy distinta| por lo que a Anika la evaluaría con un 1 y a Sanjay con un 5!!!,Oct 9| 2018,3

Vi hadde en fin opplevelse| oppgraderte rommet når vi kom tidlig for å få sjekket inn på et ledig hjørnerom. Utsikten og komforten var ikke verd oppgraderingen| da rom over 17 etg var nye og fine. Liten forskjell i størrelse. Gode senger| håndkledet og renhold på rommet. Frokosten var noe dyr| holdt den beste standard og utvalg jeg har opplevd i USA| men renholdet og servicen her kunne vært bedre. Lang kø og mye venting etter kl 0830.,Oct 9| 2018,5
Espera mais. Chuveiro ruim e toalhas sujas. As despesas incluidas nao foram claramente descritas... tipo café da manhã que paguei e não sabia...,Oct 8| 2018,3
部屋の金庫が壊れていた。Ｓｅｃｕｒｉｔｙの人が来たが、道具がないから後で、と言ったきり来なかった。たんすの引き出しも壊れていて開きっぱなしだった。部屋の割に料金が高すぎる。,Oct 7| 2018,3
商务出差，位置不错在纽约市中心，去哪儿都挺方便的，步行距离可以到中央公园等地方。大楼年代比较久了，设施设备略显得陈旧一些。酒店房间数量很多，所以房客也比较多，什么人都会有，清净就谈不上了。总体来说算希尔顿品牌连锁中等水平吧。,Oct 4| 2018,4
清掃が行き届いてない。(リビングの埃、洗面所の汚れなど)バスにお湯を入れたら茶色い水が出た。何度入れ替えても色がついていた。酷いです,Oct 4| 2018,2
호텔이 너무나도 크기 때문에 그저 스쳐 지나가는 것처럼 보일지언정호텔에서의 서비스는 받기 어렵습니다그저 내 몫을 챙겨야 합니다리조트 이용요금을 받지만 그것은 다시 사용할수 있기에못 알아보거나 못쓰면 돈만날리는 경우가 됩니다엘리베이터 는 층별로 나눠져있고 빨리옵니다좋아요,Oct 1| 2018,5
O HILTON MIDTOWN TEM SIDO A NOSSA ESCOLHA E NYC. É UM HOTEM IMPESSOAL MAS EFICIENTE. OS QUARTOS SÃO ESPAÇOSOS| O CAFÉ DA MANHÃ É BOM| AS INSTALAÇÕES SÃO MODERNAS. TUDO FUNCIONA BEM. A LOCALIZAÇÃO É A MELHOR. PERTO DE TUDO| MAS SEM OS TRANSTORNOS DA BROADWAY E CONGESTIONAMENTOS DA QUINTA AVENIDA| O PREÇO É COMPATÍVEL COM OS PRATICADOS PELOS HOTÉS DE MESMA CATEGORIA NO LOCAL. RECOMENDO !,Sep 29| 2018,4
Ótimo hotel| as acomodações atenderam plenamente as  minhas necessidades.,Sep 28| 2018,5
Hotel in posizione ideale in Midtown!!!... da ritornarci assolutamente!!!,Sep 28| 2018,4
Instalações impecáveis| atendimento muito bom| localização privilegiada| pode-se ir caminhando tanto para o Central Park como para a Times Square. Único ponto negativo é uma taxa compulsória mas consumível de $25/dia nos restaurantes do hotel. Os preços até são justos| mas não queríamos ter essa obrigação de fazer algumas refeições dentro do hotel para não perder o valor.,Sep 25| 2018,4
5min zu Fuß vom Timesquare weg... gut vom Flughafen erreichbar,Sep 25| 2018,4
El hotel está muy bien ubicado.  Habitación amplia y sin ruidos.El personal en general atento,Sep 24| 2018,4

My worst stay in NY! The service it is terrible| waited more than 1 hour to make the check in| the front desk extremely incompetent| nobody helped my to connect the internet| first I called| second went to the front desk and ask for help| they just gave to me a paper with instructions that didn't work!The only that is good| it is the location of the hotel but for the price that I paid we can find a better hotel around the area.,Sep 21| 2018,2

Veldig sentral beliggenhet.Helt greit rom for prisen.,Sep 15| 2018,4
Hotel com aspecto velho| carpetes e quartos precisando de reforma. Havia uma fila diária de quase 30 minutos para conseguir sentar e tomar café da manhã. Inacreditável a displicência do hotel e a falta de respeito com os hóspedes. Nunca mais me hospedarei lá.,Sep 15| 2018,2
buen hotel,Sep 12| 2018,5
albergo in ottima posizione ma un po' troppo dispersivo e affollato| buona la pulizia,Sep 10| 2018,3
立地がとても良かったです！お部屋も大変綺麗でしたが朝食の種類が少なく残念でした💦,Sep 10| 2018,3
口コミではトラブルがあった時の対応が悪い、など書込みがありましたが、２ベットの部屋はキレイで広かったですしアメニティの交換もハウスキーピングも行き届いていて困ることは全くありませんでした。何より、ホテル前で常時タクシーをつかまえてくれることもあり、歩くにしても、活動するには本当に立地はベストだと思います。シーズンによってはなかなか手が出ない金額になりますがやはりヒルトン。特にこのミッドタウンは安心して宿泊できるホテルだと思いました。,Sep 9| 2018,5
好立地なのが何よりの魅力でした。時差のため　昼過ぎに疲れが出やすく、その時に　ホテルに帰り休憩をとることができたのがとても良かったです。,Sep 6| 2018,4

Very dirty| bathroom was smelly| shower was horrible| way to loud at night. No valley parking,Aug 17| 2021,1
The hotel is clean and the front desk staff were pleasant. The employee at the rooftop bar was rather rude to us but another person noticed and tried to apologize on his behalf. Would not recommend it.  The air conditioner in the room could not keep up and would not cool less than 76 degrees. They could not give us ice and the room did not even come with cups or a fridge. Instead we had a vending machine in our room that was empty. We even asked for water and they basically told us to go down the street to get water from a local store. We understand some things are necessary to help stop the spread of COVID but not even being able to sell water bottles? The shower door in our small room opened in so you have to get sprayed in the face and soak the bathroom floor in order to turn it on.,Aug 17| 2021,3
Location| friendliness of staff,Aug 16| 2021,5
Great customer service from the morning to afternoon staffs but not so much from the night crew. Air quality of the room is so bad my eyes and throat started hurting every night. Really should consider using air purifier or clean the a/c.,Aug 16| 2021,3
Overall it was nice stay. Personnel was friendly. Room was clean and comfortable. Good location if you planning to spend time in Chelsea or Fashion district.,Aug 15| 2021,5

Great staff at Check-In. Very friendly and efficient. Was greeted as soon as I walked in,Aug 15| 2021,5
The AC in our room was not functioning or cooling. We called to see if it can be repaired. It didn’t really do anything. Next day I called again and they provided us a fan.,Aug 14| 2021,3
Overall property was nice but the surrounding area was ran down and trashy.It is close to all subway entrances which is a plus and Times Square is a 15 minute walk from property,Aug 12| 2021,3

I absolutely loved my stay here. The hotel is situated in a perfect location. Really close to subway stations. The staff are lovely| would always greet me by name and were always happy to assist me with extra English breakfast tea| sugars and creamers. I loved the rooftop bar too. I will definitely be coming back to New York and I will certainly be staying here! Thank you New York Hilton it’s been such a pleasure!,Jul 27| 2021,5

Liked the location and our view was not bad.  Shower in room 2004 overflowed.  But really it was a great stay for us.,Jul 21| 2021,5

Staff was very professional| helpfull and nice. Hotel was ok| didn't have ice machines available due to COVID restrictions. Kind of expensive but well everything in NYC is expensive. A/c in room not that great but everything was clean and in good conditions.,Jul 19| 2021,4
The service was amazing the people at the front desk were awesome. Everything about this stay was awesome!!!,Jul 19| 2021,5
Great staff - always very kind and helpful! Clean| quiet room (14th floor alley side) with actually comfy beds! A fridge would’ve been helpful| but I didn’t think to check on that before my arrival. I would choose this location again.,Jul 19| 2021,4
Horrible. Shower and bathroom was disgusting & I was forced to shower in another room due to the broken shower. Had to fight for somewhat of a refund| disgusting.,Jul 19| 2021,1
Hotel is very unremarkable. Room is fine.  Bathroom is fine. Front desk staff a bit on the “sassy” side. Wouldn’t make a point to stay here again.  Neighborhood feels more “just off Times Square| than cute And Cozy Chelsea.  But all was fine,Jul 19| 2021,4
We would absolutely stay here again!! Location to subway is great but so not unreasonable walk to Broadway/Times Square,Jul 18| 2021,4
The room was fine; however| cleaning wasn't available until the third day.  Had to request a coffee Kerrigan machine and an iron which was missing from the room.Ice/ Ice machine was not available at all.,Jul 18| 2021,3
No real amenities for such a high price,Jul 17| 2021,3
Great location. Clean rooms. Overall very pleased.,Jul 12| 2021,5
Comfortable and stylish hotel with a great bed and location. My only issue was with the broken or restricted air conditioning system. It was a terribly muggy weekend and I couldn't believe the ac was staggered to not go below 74-75 degrees. Please fix this issue as summer drags on. Cheaper hotels can manage to have properly cooled rooms during the summer| so should you.,Jul 12| 2021,4
Nice| clean| and friendly staff. The room has all you need for a NY stay. The location was perfect for the fashion district and 7-minute walk to Penn Station and Amtrak. Good TV and comfortable bed. Shower had great water pressure. Enjoyable.,Jul 11| 2021,5

We had a generally pleasant 4-night stay at this conveniently located (just off 7th Ave. near the subway and a few blocks from Penn Station) hotel in my favorite town.  We were out most of the day and pleased to rest in a comfortable bed in a cool room. Due to pandemic regulations| there was no ice available and room cleaning was only every 3 days.  We put out our garbage outside the door which was collected daily.  The room was very compact (NY size) and the bathroom was serviceable| but needs more hooks to hang towels.  Note that there's also no fridge and not all the elevators were in service.  There's also construction going on| as the front of the hotel was protected by scaffolding.  Reception was friendly and any requests for towels| etc. were delivered promptly.  After checkout| it was so convenient to be able to leave our suitcases at the front desk for a bit.,Jul 7| 2021,4
The Hilton is very centrally located in the city with good food close by. The rooms are a little small but to be expected for NYC. The staff is great and the wifi is very reliable,Jul 7| 2021,4
Good.,Jul 6| 2021,5
Just the best. Great location. Exceptional staff with excellent service from the front desk to the cleaning crew. Our every want was met immediately. Location near everything in the mid-town area. Great knowledge of the places to eat and see in the area. People always smiling and ready to help. Three elevators so no waiting and no lines.,Jul 6| 2021,5
The staff was very nice and accomodating. The room had a few stains on the wall| looked like spills or splashes of some sort. There was a crouton on the side of the bed. I  loved the location. Overall was a good stay| the cleanliness details need a bit more attention.,Jul 6| 2021,4
Hotel failed to mention they were still following C19 rules with no housekeeping. That restaurant were under construction.,Jul 5| 2021,3
Most inconspicuous Hilton I’ve seen. Views were okay. Elevators are slow.,Jul 5| 2021,4

Originally stopped in to drop off our luggage because we were a little early but Sid took care of us as soon as we walked in and we were able to actually check in earlier. So that was awesome in itself. Just a few minor things seemed to be a little out of date and our shower was a little small but the room was spacious and clean. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel. Sid really took care of us with whatever we needed as well as the rest of the staff. Every staff member was polite and welcoming.,Jul 4| 2021,5
This hotel was just okay and did the job,Jul 3| 2021,3
Close to downtown and easy to access the stores.,Jul 3| 2021,4
Excelent staff,Jul 3| 2021,5
I liked the rooftop restaurant. The hotel parking was terrible and VERY expensive. I had to sit and wait two hours to check in at 6PM. Overall bad experience,Jul 3| 2021,1
It was pleasant…..finding parking was the main issue,Jul 2| 2021,3
I overall had a decent stay but there aren't any refrigerators in the rooms and also no on site restaurant so that was inconvenient,Jun 30| 2021,4
Very friendly staff and attentive. Very good experience and would stay here in a heartbeat.,Jun 30| 2021,5
Good property for money,Jun 30| 2021,5
My guest and myself got stuck in the elevator and management showed no concern they reacted as if that has happen before the stated let me take it down dismissing us rude bad experiences,Jun 30| 2021,1
When I first arrived my room sheets were dirty and there was blood on the bathroom floor. Hotel changed my room which was great. There are no amenities. No refrigerator| microwave| ice machine| just nowhere to get a drink of water unless you leave the hotel. Big inconvenience for me.,Jun 30| 2021,2
Under renovation but great service & area.,Jun 30| 2021,5
The most disappointing Hilton we have ever stayed at. They didn't clean the room the entire time we were there!! 4 days with no clean sheets or towels!! No ice machine! We had to walk a couple blocks for ice. The included breakfast was not available and they did not compensate for this. The room was much smaller than the pictures online. No microwave| no fridge and the in room bar was empty. They only good part of the room was the shower. Overall this was a terrible room and I would look elsewhere for a hotel.,Jun 29| 2021,1
Our experience with this hotel was very very disappointing. Especially for a Hilton. The room was not cleaned one time during our 4 night stay. Not once! We even asked for it to be cleaned including fresh sheets but they never came. The air conditioning was not very good. The room was very small compared to the pictures online. No refrigerator| no ice machine| no microwave| the in room bar was empty and the parking was down the street. We had to walk a few blocks for a bag of ice! There is also a $50 per day charge that's extra. There was 3 of us in the room and we had to ask for clean towels everyday and every time they would bring only 2! It was overall a terrible disappointment. I would not recommend this Hilton at all.,Jun 28| 2021,1
We really enjoyed our stay at the Hilton. It was very reasonably priced and had a great location - we were able to walk almost everywhere we wanted to (we mainly stayed in lower Manhattan). The WiFi was also excellent| especially for a hotel. FYI: the fitness center is closed. I didn't know this in advance| but I am glad I had packed a travel mat and was able to use my class pass credits are nearby studios. My only other complaint was that there could be better lighting in the room and a fridge!,Jun 28| 2021,5
Service was great !,Jun 28| 2021,5
We we disgusted and disappointed in the overall quality of this hotel. It was not at all in the condition as displayed on the internet. The lobby had visible dust on the check-in desk and the keyboard was so filthy it needs to be thrown away. Initially| we were assigned to room 712: it was as dusty as the front desk| some visible fluid marks were on the headboard| night stand| wall paper peeling off the ceiling and walls| and the room had an awful stench. So| I called and spoke with Zorabell and she assigned us to 1103. Well| it was the same as 712. So| after a long day of travel| we found dinner and walked the streets to find clean and well kept hotel. A must have in this age of COVID. Zorabell and Caroline are the best part of this establishment.,Jun 28| 2021,1
Friendly staff| room size is k| But not cleaning every day an room does Not have microwave| or mini fridge,Jun 28| 2021,4
Lots of pros:  great location for public transit| nice size room| good bathroom.  Cons:  Fridge is full of chargeable items with NO space for your own drink or leftovers| I appreciate the nod to using recycled toilet paper but switch to sustainable bamboo| and please have ICE!!!,Jun 28| 2021,4
Good value for the cost.,Jun 27| 2021,4
Good stay. Hotel was clean| check in was seamless. The only drawback was the $60 fee that I had to pay for the overnight garage.,Jun 27| 2021,5
I loved the water pressure in the shower and the AC worked swell,Jun 27| 2021,5
I wish the room was a little bit bigger and that the beds were bigger. NO ICE MACHINE was a drag. Nice restaurant and rooftop cafe within hotel| but they were really expensive. Overall though| it was a nice stay.,Jun 27| 2021,4

First time to NY| hotel was nice and clean. I didn’t get a chance to hang out at the roof top bar| which I think should be open to folks staying at the hotel without reservations. I was told you had to make reservations. Only thing I would’ve added was a fridge and access to ice. I enjoyed the stay. Great location as well.,Jun 22| 2021,4

We were told the in house restaurant and bar were closed so we received our $50/day resort credits at a convenience store down the street.  The first day it was fun but no one wants to eat there for four days.  At least we never ran out of bottled water.  Also there was no housekeeping due to covid but they don’t tell you that until you arrive.  The staff was amazingly helpful but with the lack of housekeeping| the mess outside (construction)| the only one working elevator removed the glamour of my first trip to NYC.  It wasn’t horrible but I wish I had stayed somewhere else.,Jun 15| 2021,4
One of the very slower elevators was out of service. They didn’t have air conditioning turned on for the hallways and with the heat| it was uncomfortable to wait for the elevators. I arranged to have room service come in to clean my room and that wasn’t done. I tried to get a cocktails on the rooftop bar and was turned away even though they were accepting walk ins and appeared to have plenty of room on a Tuesday night. The downstairs bar was never open.,Jun 15| 2021,3
Hotel was under construction/ renovation. Fitness room was also closed for renovation. No microwave or fridge in the room. Only a small locked fridge to dispense their own merchandise. No drinking water available: only Hilton honor members could get 2 bottle water a day. I was at many Hilton hotels before and this was the worst. Front desk people were friendly and polite.,Jun 15| 2021,2
This is a not a 4 star hotel. It was the perfect example of when hotel companies strip services. No ice machine. handicap stay away. You cannot make an ice pack.  No refrigerator it’s not what I expected.,Jun 14| 2021,1
Great service| comfortable room| nice location. I lived in NY for 5 years and just came back to visit and Hilton is definitely worth returning to!,Jun 14| 2021,5
The room,Jun 14| 2021,1
Our experience was terrible| especially considering that it was our first time traveling after Covid. This is a Hilton? The front of the building is covered in unmarked scaffolding with the only barely noticeable| unlit Hilton signage set way back and printed on the temporary "plastic" entry doors that can only be seen when you walk by and look really hard. Our room was dark and depressing with very dark blue carpeting| dark brown (almost black) dinged up furniture| and a dark blue photo wall (of abstrated "trees"?) The carpeting was dusty| the TV remote was dead and when we took it down to the front desk (we also requested an extra pillow)| we never heard from anyone again| and never got back the remote - or the pillow. The bed felt really old and soft| the outlet next to the bed was dead and didn't charge my phone| and the room phone was dead (and filthy). Also| the fitness facility was still closed with no mention of that on Expedia or in the hotel notes| and there was dirty laundry - stained towels and sheets - left on the floor hallway outside our room for hours. Someone spilled candy in the hall that was crushed into the dirty carpet and stayed that way for two days. UGH| Hilton| never again. Our son just moved to the neighborhood and we plan to be there often but there are a lot of other options - we won't be back.,Jun 14| 2021,1
No ice machine on premises. Elevator wasn’t reliable. Having to spend $200 on hotel or bodega credit and not being able to cash it or take it off bill.,Jun 14| 2021,3
Price I paid was reasonable but the overall size of room and bathroom was okayNo freeze for your personnel drinks,Jun 13| 2021,3
I liked the convenience of the location.  The staff was very friendly and informative. I didnt like that there was no microwave or refrigerator.   It would have been nice to be able to reheat some food if we wanted to.,Jun 13| 2021,5
Not clean,Jun 13| 2021,2
Front desk young lady was rude. I checked in amd asked her for my bag we usually get at all double tree/Hilton. She said that is only for Hilton members. Told her I am a member. She said well you won’t get point for your stay cause you. Poked through a third party. Had nothing to do with the question of the bag but decided to humiliate me without looking at computer and verifying my honor member. On the Property no elevator was working or one out of the three with linea backing up downstairs and upstairs. Ac didn’t work properly. Hilton brand is going down hill. Next time we staying at Sheraton or Holiday inn express .,Jun 12| 2021,1
I enjoyed staying| I will sure come back| the location| the quick response of staff| the cleanliness| everything was great,Jun 11| 2021,5

Good experience.,Jun 11| 2021,5
I was happy with this selection.  The only glitch was that of the three elevators| one was down for scheduled service and one was broken.  That left only one elevator for all 22 floors| which was not nearly enough.  I walked down the stairs a couple of times| but they exit directly outside.  Then| I'd have to come back in the lobby to go to the front desk.,Jun 9| 2021,5
Great location! Staff was very accommodating and friendly .,Jun 9| 2021,5
Hotel in a great location. Close to transportation| Empire Stare bldg and shopping. Easy walk to Times Square and #1 subway.,Jun 9| 2021,4
The property was not to my liking the pics online have been enlarged because the room was very very small. Stayed on the 21st floor and the elevator was broke had to walk up all the steps one night. The A/C unit in our room was broke it would work one min and stop the next. The city room they gave us was not a city view AT ALL!!! No need to open the curtains. The sheets had a weird smell to it. The staff was nice that’s the only thing I can say good about this hotel. Overall I would not suggest this hotel,Jun 8| 2021,1
This hotel was at the perfect location for all the activities I had planned. Everything was walking distance. The staff was great and friendly. The rooms were perfect with a great AC!,Jun 8| 2021,5
Muy mal servicio en front desk| nunca me ayudaron. Las llaves se desprograman. El cuarto estaba maltratado. El aire acondicionado nunca lo arreglaron. Olía todo el tiempo a comida El peor Hilton donde me he quedado,Jun 7| 2021,2
The front desk was able to get us an early check-in. It was a nice stay at a decent price. Easy to walk to the village or midtown. My only complaints are 1 elevator was out the whole time which made waiting to ho in/out a hassle. And the shower door leaked A LOT. It was a bit dangerous.,Jun 7| 2021,4
The location was great!,Jun 6| 2021,4
Don't go there!!!They decided to save money by not providing housekeeping and didn't open the fitness center. They said it is due too Covid 19 restrictions| however all their neighboring hotels are providing these services (I went there and asked).It was like staying in Airbnb! Had to clean the room| take out the trash replace sheets and towels by myself. Worst experience ever!!!,Jun 6| 2021,1
Loved our stay!,Jun 6| 2021,4
Hard to find| since hotel is under renovation| there is no sigh outside| we missed it at first and had to come back.,Jun 6| 2021,4
First I called the hotel before booking to make sure they were not under construction.  Showed up and scaffolding was all over the building.  I asked for a quiet room to avoid the noise and was put next to the stairwell.  7 am and doors were slamming and staff was talking loudly outside the door.  No service due to covid but no real system for clean towels and trash pick up.  Had to call twice for towels and leave trash outside the door. Room was very small and a little dated. The elevators did not all seem to be working.  On a positive note the front desk staff was nice and very helpful.  Overall the room was clean.,Jun 5| 2021,3
The hotel staff were extremely friendly| helpful and professional. They even remembered my name and greeted me each time I passed through the lobby.  My first hotel stay  emerging from the pandemic could not have been better!,Jun 5| 2021,5
Everything was great. The only real problem was the elevator. Only 1 of the 3 worked reliably. Not having a mini fridge was not great either but the room was nice. Great location for getting all around town.,Jun 3| 2021,5
My room had a leak in the ceiling. Had to move| then moved to a much smaller room that I could not control the temperature and shower head did not work.,Jun 2| 2021,2
Elevators were not working. Staff is definitely not customer service oriented.,Jun 2| 2021,2
Was not made aware the hotels was Under construction ...no restaurant...no food ...no ice even. Rooms outdated.. had to change rooms several times...,Jun 2| 2021,2
Some of the rooms  had coffee machine  we asked for one and they said they were going to drop it off the next day but they never did As well as we asked for towels and we have to go again and asked for them,May 31| 2021,3
The beds are very comfortable| great sheets| absolutely wonderful pillows. And the water pressure was wonderful. I unfortunately had to be in New York City at the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic| the staff was so helpful and informative and I appreciated their relaxed demeanor| I saw no paranoia while the rest of the city seemed apocalyptic!!,Mar 17| 2020,5
Overall a very uncomfortable stay. The hotel itself is not as advertised,Mar 9| 2020,2
Room was clean and the hotel is located in great location. Some people at the front desk are not friendly at all.,Mar 9| 2020,4
We stayed for one night because our hotel was centrally located for our activities and travel.  We were happy with the room.,Mar 9| 2020,5
Overall the experience was good. Only feedback is would’ve been nice to have a fridge to put our drinks in. The fridge is designed so that it is strictly a mini bar. The gym is also small and dated. But for the amount we paid the hotel was clean & staff was friendly. I would stay there again.,Mar 7| 2020,5
Nice clean property.  We were on 8th floor very noisy street,Mar 2| 2020,4

i signed up for king bed but they gave me a double bed,Feb 15| 2020,3
The room was small and dark furniture.  My bed faced the bathroom.toilet.I was VERY disappointed that my bathroom did not have a wall mirror so I can do my make up!!!!   You can not do your makeup with the mirror on the top of the sink.  It is too far.     I tried to use the mirror on the door and there was not good lighting.I could not eat in the hotel.  Restaurant in construction. I did not enjoy my stay. Jackie,Feb 14| 2020,3
Great location| fast checking and staff is so friendly and helpful.  Room is large for a NYC hotel.,Feb 14| 2020,5
Location was great| staff was friendly| room was clean,Feb 12| 2020,5
I liked how secluded the hotel was| did not like how the restaurant/bar was under renovation,Feb 12| 2020,5
The room was clean and comfortable. The shower had great pressure! And the staff was friendly and professional.  My only complaint was the absence of a mini fridge for food storage.,Feb 2| 2020,5
Small room. I don’t like the decoration. Noisy neighbors. Close to elevator.,Jan 31| 2020,2
Clean and comfortable rooms. Nice bathrooms. Convenient location. Friendly staff.,Jan 29| 2020,5
The location is great as a central place to see every tourist site of Manhattan,Jan 28| 2020,5
Nice hotel| with a comfortable bed in a pretty standard room.  Convenient location to out of town bus drop-off and pickup| and pretty central to several of the things I wanted to do in the city.,Jan 21| 2020,4
Only one attendant at check-in| debating prices with another customer| so we had to wait (and wait) to check in.  We then learned the bar/restaurant was closed for renovation| which meant a trip out side for morning coffee on the coldest days of the year (Keurig isn't really coffee.)  Decided that since bar was closed I'd bite the bullet and get a beer from the Mini-bar - which was empty.  To get ice you need to go to the lobby and request it - but they didn't have an ice bucket to put it in. Hard to believe this is a Hilton property.,Jan 20| 2020,3
There were no water bottles available on premises. Staff suggested I walk to a 24/hr corner store if I wanted one as they had run out and would not be getting any until the morning.,Jan 16| 2020,2
We love this location. Easily Accessible to midtown and downtown area. It is our go to hotel when in the area. The hotel rooftop bar is awesome. The rooms are clean and fairly large for a NYC hotel.,Jan 14| 2020,5
Great location and close to lots of food options close to MSG and Grand Central Station.,Jan 12| 2020,4
Smell of marijuana in lobby and elevator at night. Overall good experience.,Jan 9| 2020,4
Good Hilton hotel. Good location| subway is a couple of blocks away but no big deal. Restaurant and rooftop were closed for remodeling. Clean| small rooms but ok size for New York. Good service. No Hilton points if booked on expedia.,Jan 8| 2020,4
Great location and walking distance to many landmark attractions,Jan 8| 2020,4
Very disappointing stay. Checking in staff was not friendly and had no connection with guest. My room was very cold. Had to call downstairs twice to have engineering come up to the room for the heat. It was placed on auto and came on once then stopped. No room move or extra linen was given. I checked out early that morning for another hotel. Nothing was memorable from staff| location or room/amenities.,Jan 6| 2020,3
The staff was very friendly| room was clean and comfortable. Had no issues with my stay.,Jan 6| 2020,5
Ok I we’ll come back next time but the room no water drink i hope next time have’s,Jan 6| 2020,3
Wonderful... Highly recommend staying at this hotel.,Jan 6| 2020,5
Just what the doctor order,Jan 3| 2020,5
Hotel was great. Great location.,Jan 2| 2020,5
There wasn't a in house restaurant| and they said they'll charge extra for drinking water as it wasn't part of the package.,Jan 1| 2020,3
Great room. Friendly staff. Convenient location.,Dec 30| 2019,5
Quick and easy to check in and out| happy they had valley parking| cool simple clean bathroom. Comfortable bed Can I prove snacks in the room.,Dec 30| 2019,4
The hotel was clean| modern and comfortable| away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square but only a 10-15 minute walk away.  A convenient subway station is only three blocks away.  Good selection of TV channels.  Pouty children in the adjoining room could be easily heard. Main complaint was with their so-called “room service”.  At check-in the receptionist said the restaurant was not operating but that we could order “24 hour room service”.  It turned out their “room service” was an 800 phone call to an outside operation that sent half warm food from who knows where by delivery boy.  Being Christmas evening when calling to order and discovering the true nature of this “service”| we had no Plan B.  Maybe this is a new fad employed nowadays by hotels?  Don’t know. But we felt the receptionist was purposely vague| if not outright misleading| in saying they had “room service”. Also we did not like the motion sensor light in the bathroom| but that was easily foiled by placing a towel over the sensor.  All in all| a quite suitable hotel.,Dec 28| 2019,5
Room a bit small but clean and quiet.  Good price.,Dec 27| 2019,4
Great location but a standard hotel .Nothing special or luxury,Dec 27| 2019,4
My family stayed Hilton NYC fashion district last two days. We visit NYC every year and we pick Hilton again because we had really good memories at other Hilton hotel last 5 times but not this time. Very friendly staffs and we were exciting when we enter the room - pretty big size room and good location| good start.We all exciting so we left hotel for trip right after use the bathroom| but we find somethings wrong when we were back. We only leave luggage and use bathroom and left hotel room which is we didn’t do anything but a lot of paper pieces and little dust balls around room. In the bath room| only two pairs of towel sets so I have to ask people for get more. I tried use hair dryer but a lot of hairs on that shelf and on the hair dryer. And we try to make some coffee but they ready 1k-cup tea| 4 k-cup coffee| 2 creamers| and one sugar and creamer bags. Which is one of my couple have to give up use sugar - because we do not use fake sugar. So| me and my husband clean up the floor(we don’t want our kids touch that dirty things) and I asked people for extra towel sets| that’s okay.Next day| I leave message on the bed - Please ready 4sets of towels| 4 coffee cups| and 4 creamers and 3sets of sugar packs. Thank you.We were back to hotel room around 8pm and my husband and  youngest kid go to bathroom and try to take shower but they can’t because no towels on the shelf.Unfortunately| they didn’t vacuumed room and they didn’t leave coffee cups whatever I asked them. Fro,Dec 25| 2019,2
Perfect place to stay. Would recommend to anyone. Good parking on the side of the street.,Dec 21| 2019,5
We would recommend the Hilton Hotel in the Fashion District. Great location| friendly staff| and the quality of the rooms were high as you would expect at the Hilton. Unfortunately| there was no bar| restaurant or anywhere in the hotel to go for some "downtime" due to refurbishments. That said| this is New York! It didn't spoil our stay there are plenty of bars| restaurants and cafes near the hotel.,Dec 20| 2019,5
Convenient location and good value for price.,Dec 19| 2019,4
A banana was find under one of the beds also the rug near one of the beds had an odor. I look under the bed but I didn’t see anything,Dec 17| 2019,4

Being originally from NYC we booked this hotel while in town visiting for a show. We are New Yorkers so for us this hotel was very nice & conveniently located literally steps from F.I.T./ 34th Street. Conveniently located walking about a minute distance from the #1 train. Employees are very personable. Our room was sufficient enough for us as a couple & I did enjoy being on a high floor away from noise. I appreciate that without a room key you’re unable to move in the elevators; I feel this prohibits a lot of unnecessary people lingering in the hotel and made for a VERY peaceful & restful stay. My only bummer was that it does list a refrigerator as a room amenity but there’s only a refrigerator that holds items that you MUST pay for if used. This was only a bummer because we were hoping to keep our leftovers. Overall| I enjoyed my stay & I’d definitely stay here again.,Oct 22| 2019,5
I loved the fact that the hotel is so close to all the action in Manhattan.  I did not like that there was no available parking at the property and i psid extra for a high floor room based on the views shown on the website.  My view ended up being tge back wall of another biolding with water towers| definitely not worth paying extra for that view.,Oct 16| 2019,3
The rooms were clean and cool.I was very disappointed though- I booked here because of the roof top bar and restaurant. It was closed for renovations. We were told that there was 24 hr room service at check in| later were told it was not currently available.,Oct 16| 2019,3
My stay was pleasant. Staff was friendly and helpful. The rooftop and restaurant was closed for construction which I do not believe was mentioned anywhere. Location is good.,Oct 8| 2019,4
I've been choosing between several hotels and picked this one because of the rooftop and nice views. However| I haven't received either of these and was disappointed.I asked for the room on the higher floor to have some view and was given the room on the 5th floor. It was quite noisy| so I couldn't sleep well. The alarm on the room clock was set at 6 am. I didn't set it and didn't plan to wake up at 6. Rooftop bar was closed and it will be closed for a few more months| quite disappointing as well.The room was also very dark| not enough lightning.,Oct 8| 2019,3
I didn’t know the hotel was under renovations. Also the room fridge is not available for personal items which is unfortunate. I felt these things should’ve been communicated more clearly,Oct 6| 2019,4
The staff was rude upon arrival| booked a top floor room with a city view. But got a room facing construction end wall| The most unpleasant 5 nights stay. Feel like entrapment. Never again will I book this hotel.,Oct 6| 2019,1
I booked this location for the amenities| just to arrive and find the the amenities unavailable. Had I known this prior I would have selected another location. Perhaps a disclaimer noted the fact that the restaurant as well as the rooftop bar are under construction or whatever the reason.Thank You.,Oct 5| 2019,3

Had a great visit....my second time and will visit again. Although| another guest on the 14rh floor with a restless infant felt compelled to often bring their screaming and annoying infant (and| I’m a parent) to the 14th floor elevator corridor and let the infant scream there. Highly inconsiderate | ignorant and ludicrous!,Aug 30| 2019,5
one of the best hotels I ever stayed at | everyone was fun & sweet to us thanks again!!,Aug 27| 2019,5
Awesome hotel convenient location,Aug 27| 2019,5
The hotel was close to transportation. It had a rooftop bar that seemed to appeal to young people. Our first room was not clean at all. We were moved to another cleaner room but it had a queen bed. Our reservation was for a king size bed. The girl expained that this room was more expensive than the king on a lower floor but they would not charge us more. Head scratcher! There was no fridge| not even a mirror outside the bathroom. Did not live up to Hilton standards. I just feel that they took advantage of us. We did not get what we paid for. How can you help us Expedia?,Aug 24| 2019,2
Room was very nice and clean,Aug 24| 2019,5

The buffet breakfast is disappointing Such as the oak meal was gone Down to the bottom and they never replaced it with a new potAnd we were there from 9:30 am to 20:30amFor three times. Aug 17 to aug 19,Aug 20| 2019,3

Room is small and air conditioner  is noisy.  Roomservice phone number is not function and take long time for them to respond. Location is very good,Aug 9| 2019,2
The worst experience!   The sheets and pillows had been sprayed right before we checked in| the smell was so potent that it made me physically ill.  The hotels resolution was so give me 5|000 points.  This is unacceptable however the hotel manager was rude and  informed me they would not be compensating me any further|  I am an Hilton Honors member and I will NOT be staying at Hilton Hotels any longer!,Aug 8| 2019,1
Property is well situated between Midtown and lower Manhattan| with transportation and nearby shopping| this property is a great place to stay.,Aug 6| 2019,4
I was asking for a taxi| then they offer their own driver for $50 ( include tip) to LGA airport. I took the deal| when we arrived at the airport| the driver asked  $53. I gave him $50 because it was the deal with the front desk woman. I’m not sure even $50 deal was still good. It took just 15 minutes to get there.,Aug 5| 2019,3

The location of this property is great. The beds were smaller than "queen size" as advertised. My room was located next to the supply closet and it was very noisy as the cleaning staff began their work and continued through the night. There were no places to hang wet towels in the bathroom or hand towels. The bag checking system was easy and helpful| as were the attendants.,Jul 3| 2019,3
After a long day of walking around and going back up to the room the key did NOT work. Went back down and got new keys and back up to the room again and they didn’t work either. Had to go all the way back down to the front lobby. It took about 30 minutes of time wasted trying to get access into my room. Will not be staying here again.,Jul 3| 2019,3
Location was perfect - a couple blocks from subway; and walkable distance to the Greenwich Village and midtown Manhattan.,Jul 2| 2019,4
I did not like that check in was so delayed for such a time-pressured day. We came for pride and I had requested an early check in weeks prior and then the day of I called at 12 pm and was told a room would be ready by 1 pm just to find out that no room was ready and we waited 2 and a half hours for a room to open and went past the normal check-in time. We missed half the parade.,Jul 2| 2019,1
I like this place is very clean and price is reasonable in NYC.,Jul 1| 2019,4
Wish there was an ice machine as we couldn’t have any cold water/drinks. Also wish the fridge wasn’t completely pre occupied with drinks you had to pay for. We had brought drinks that needed to be in the fridge but had to just get over that. Besides that the front desk people were amazing in making our world pride trip a success and letting us know how to take the subway when all streets were blocked. It was a life saver.,Jul 1| 2019,4
Excellent room per price Very neat |clean and comfortable Nice front in service at reception,Jul 1| 2019,5
Stay and room were great. I will definitely be returning.,Jun 29| 2019,5
Very comfortable and accommodating,Jun 28| 2019,4
Customer Service was exceptional.,Jun 27| 2019,5
The property is nice. Room is good. Bed is comfortable. The staff was great. The young man who checked me in and out went out of his way to help me.,Jun 23| 2019,5
Customer service was great both in the hotel and restaurant!,Jun 22| 2019,5
Went to New York with my girlfriend for the weekend it was a lot of un and the hotel was clean and modern.,Jun 21| 2019,5
It’s not a “Hilton”. They just slap the name “Hilton” on it.,Jun 17| 2019,2
Hotel had a dirty sock that did not belong to us next to the bed. Otherwise room appeared clean. Bellhop was nice and helpful and so was the receptionist. At night we had friends over at the rooftop bar. Before they left we were having a conversation in the lobby for a while.  We were approached by a staff member who asked if we were guests in the hotel| to which I replied that myself and my husband were but not the other 3 people. He then demanded to see a room key which my husband was looking for. He then demanded more aggressively that we show him our key which I produced. We all understand that safety is key and that he was within his rights to ask to see it| however as a group of black people being approached by another black man that was sent by the white man over to us and being spoken to so inappropriately| we took great offense. This was around 1:15am on Sunday morning on 6/16/19.  Teach your staff that they are working in the hospitality industry (which I have a degree in) requires addressing guests with the utmost respect,Jun 17| 2019,2
Comfortable clean Will definitely stay agAin,Jun 15| 2019,5
Overall my stay was fine but didn’t really feel that 4* quality. Room didn’t seem to be as modern or thoroughly cleaned as it was made out to be. I’ve stayed in better 4* hotels which felt like they actually were 4 stars. Service was slow| it took ages for someone to bring up a small bucket of ice - had to call reception multiple times. I would recommend staying at a more reputable 4 star hotel.,Jun 12| 2019,3
Nice hotel. Great location. Friendly staff. Room was clean and comfortable.,Jun 10| 2019,4
I expected the King size bed to be bigger. It seemed a queen size to me.,Jun 10| 2019,4
Location is ok  | property not newStaff helpful| location is great,Jun 9| 2019,4
Good location| good price| really comfortable bed| big room. Would definitely recommend,Jun 8| 2019,4
Very nice hotel. Great location,Jun 3| 2019,5
A very comfortable hotel in a good location off of 7th. avenue. Rare| a restaurant connected to the hotel has the best hamburgers around.,Jun 3| 2019,5
View and location cool. No fridge no microwave no ice machines. Asked for ice from room service but never received. Just a bummer can’t keep any drinks or leftover food since no fridge or ice so ends up being a more expensive stay.,Jun 2| 2019,3
Great place to stay. Very convenient| friendly staff.,Jun 2| 2019,4
Great property. Near to the subway and great staff!!,Jun 2| 2019,5
Convenient location| staff very nice| clean and quiet rooms.,Jun 2| 2019,4
Good place| recommend place| everything was good !,May 27| 2019,4
Room was old and very dark. Bathroom sink's water strim was very weak.  Good location.,May 26| 2019,3
Nice hotel and well located. The hotel is clean and staff are very friendly.,May 26| 2019,5
Nice accommodations| little pricy for the value as the room was on the smaller side and the dark blue wallpaper made the room a lot darker than necessary.,May 20| 2019,4
i happened to get a room that had a broken door. they knew this when i checked in but instead| were far more concerned on my ID and my youth. as a youthful looking professor| i am used to this so i would not have minded so much if they had - instead of sending me into a room with an obviously broken door after a temporary fix - switched my room. that did not happen so i had to wait for 30 minutes at 3 am to be switched to an open room WITHOUT access to my luggage (change of clothes| pajamas| etc). the other managers/staff and the maintenance staff were very kind though and tried hard to accommodate me.,May 13| 2019,1
Great hotel and staff and good position for us thank you very much. Also staff were so helpful when we asked to extend our stay.,May 11| 2019,4
Everything was fine...Location was good. Very comfortable beds and clean bathroom and all.,May 10| 2019,5
This hotel was a decent NYC Hilton. The location is very central to everything in midtown Manhattan and the 28th St. 1 subway stop. The rooms are not tiny and there is a restaurant downstairs that has some pretty affordable items on the menu. The beds were comfortable as well. My only gripe was that they wouldn’t let me up to see the rooftop bar with my six-year-old. I didn’t even want to get a drink| just to check it out.,May 7| 2019,4
Very nice place clean and neat Kindly people warmly welcome,May 6| 2019,4
Had to pay for ice to be delivered several times per day. No ice machines. Had to use mini bar for soft drinks as there were no soft drink machines. Need more of a menu variety. Everything in mini-bar was always hot.,May 5| 2019,4
Good location with friendly staff. Rather non-descript hotel and rooms.,May 1| 2019,4
Comfortable,Apr 30| 2019,5
The hotel is in a centric location| walking distance to mayor attractions; rooms are small| but perfect for sleeping at the end of a night out. The elevators are a bit slow| you can hear noise from the corridor into the room| not properly insulated. The shower was very narrow| about 30” w| the shower glass door swings in - making it hard to maneuver | and the water stills out. You will need to have a towel from preventing a pool to form.,Apr 30| 2019,3
The hotel was clwan and nice.  FIT University and Korean Town were also nearby. But I was a bit loud as to whether to work at dawn.,Apr 29| 2019,5
Location| quality and friendly staff -- overall great stay.,Apr 29| 2019,5
small room| no its own parking lot. arrived late and nobody was there to handle the parking. Not a 4 star hotel| at best 3 star. small boutique hotel. not the hilton you may think,Apr 23| 2019,1
There was no menu nor a kettle in the room. I guess I just had higher expectations as it was a “Hilton” hotel. However| my stay was pleasant otherwise. Food was good.,Apr 23| 2019,4
Knowing how expensive the cost of living is in New York and the not-so-expensive cost of our hotel room| I was expecting the room to be smaller than normal with less amenities.  It was a great size with good amenities and the staff was quite friendly and accommodating.,Apr 20| 2019,5
Clean rooms....Rennovated restrooms.....Front desk staff was very nice,Apr 19| 2019,5
We were staying just one night  We got a great rate| location was ideal for what we were doing.  Friendly and helpful staff. Clean comfortable accommodations,Apr 17| 2019,4
The staff were wonderful and helpful. I thought the location was okay. But it was a respectable and nice place to stay,Apr 17| 2019,5
Great hotel| Great location.,Apr 16| 2019,5
I know that most NYC hotels are small| but this is very small and overpriced,Apr 16| 2019,3
Staff were very kind and welcoming. Held our luggage when we got in early and even got us a room 3 hours before their check in time. Location was awesome and close walking distance to a lot of attractions. Would stay again,Apr 16| 2019,5
Easy check in. Comfortable. Nice roof top bar with coty view.,Apr 9| 2019,5
Only one of the three elevators was working. There was up to an hour wait and I was on the 19th floor!,Apr 9| 2019,2
2 days with a single elevator half an hour to go up and down very unpleasant,Apr 9| 2019,4
Very Cute and Compact - They had a bar available and food nearby. Only thing was only one elevator was functioning,Apr 8| 2019,5
Parking in the area and central manhattan easy to navigate,Apr 5| 2019,4

The staff was great| the food in the restaurant was excellent as was our waiter and I loved the bar.  Great room| great location.  Overall excellent,Mar 18| 2019,5
Proximity| cleanliness and great restaurant and rooftop,Mar 18| 2019,4
Great location and no issues with the room either. The only issue was the elevator would take forever to come| that needs some updating specially for the money that is charged per night.,Mar 18| 2019,4
The hotel itself and the Hotels.com wasn’t accurate regarding the price of valet parking. Once checking in| I was told that the valet price was $60 though Hotels.com stated $55.,Mar 14| 2019,4
I really liked the cleanliness and everything was great| but I think if they could care a little more on sound proofing| then it would be excellent.,Mar 12| 2019,5
We had a great little weekend getaway and the Hilton was a big part of that. Perfect location for us to hang out in Chelsea. Loved Crompton Ale House directly across the street.,Mar 11| 2019,5
Staff was very nice at check in and we were surprised to find out there was a rooftop bar upon arrival! Great location and stay overall,Mar 11| 2019,4
Everything was great!,Mar 11| 2019,5
Hotel was great. And the room.  However| not for over 250.00 a night for sure.  Trust me.  Restaurant needs a pick me up in the decor. Food was good.  Front desk great.  Bathroom very nice.  Will come again but not the inflated prices.  Not there.,Mar 10| 2019,4
I like the location and the surrounding places to eat but for the hotel being a Hilton I expected it to be a bit cleaner.,Mar 10| 2019,3
We had a great stay at this hotel. Check in was really easy| the staff was friendly enough| nothing stellar but not rude so that was good. The staff in the attached restaurant was wonderful| very friendly! Food there was good. Room was really nice| it has plenty of space. Bed was super comfortable.My only critique is that there is a minibar instead of a fridge. We brought beverages with us so it would have been nice to have a fridge or at least an ice bucket. During checkout they said I had taken something from the minibar but I hadn't. They had no problem removing the charge from my bill which was really really nice. Just make sure when you check out you ask for your bill so that you don't get charged for anything. Overall I would definitely stay here again.,Mar 4| 2019,5
Great location. The property is in a very good condition. Nice restaurant on premises. Personnel is friendly and helpful.Heating system is a little noisy| as well as other guests walking by our room and talking loudly at all hours.,Mar 3| 2019,4
Clean quiet and comfortable,Mar 3| 2019,5
Small rooms| but otherwise very pleasant and clean| and the staff are wonderful and very accommodating.,Mar 2| 2019,5
Check in and check out was so fast! Room was as expected. The only thing that sucked was that there was a couple next to our room and all you could hear was all the fun they were having(if you know what I mean). Good thing me and my friend had made other plans to hang out in the city so we didn’t hear too much of anything so overall it was an okay experience!,Feb 21| 2019,4
We stayed at the Hilton in the Fashion district on the President’s day weekend of 2019.The location was excellent because it was centrally located and close to the subway.  It’s a nice neighborhood between Chelsea and the Flatiron district. There are cool restaurants and bars for a dinner or nightcap. Parking on the street was available. The hotel is modern with a classy lobby. Our room was small by most suburban hotel standards but for the location and price| it was a value.,Feb 21| 2019,4
Fantastic stay- very accommodating in moving my room when I requested a king bed instead of 2 is.,Feb 19| 2019,5
This property is located in a convenient location close to public transportation. The room wasn't huge but it was a comfortable size for a NYC hotel room. The staff was very helpful and friendly. It was a great hotel for the price.,Feb 12| 2019,5
Everyone was very friendly and helpful| the hotel bar staff was great! I felt like for the money it was a great deal| but mostly I would stay there again just because of the people that work there!,Feb 12| 2019,5
Everything was great. I had no complaints! The stay was great. Location was great.,Feb 11| 2019,5
Had so many issues with management about their key system. Asked several times for our room to be cleaned and was missed twice.,Feb 8| 2019,2
The staff was friendly and helpful. Gave me tips on what was around. Location is in walking distance to major shopping but far enough away to get out of the crowds.  I would have liked free bottled water in the room as well as a small refridge. to keep my own water and snacks cold.  The only fridge is a pay if you take...,Feb 6| 2019,4
The rooms were so close together. Should be signs posted to say please be condesent of of others when it comes to noise level. Bathroom had hair in shower and it clearly wasnt mine. Room was not pictured as description i selected.,Feb 4| 2019,3
Mostly a good stay. Heating broke down the night temperature dropped to -15c .,Feb 4| 2019,3
Its location was perfect for my needs.  My daughter attends FIT| and it is a very quick walk to FIT.,Feb 2| 2019,5
We stayed at the Hilton during the polar vortex. Staff was wonderful and checkin was super fast. However| both me and my wife got bedbug bites all over our back! We had a short stay and on the morning of our flight back home we noticed we were itchy and my wifes back is covered in red bumps. Im grossed out. The hotel is in an excellent location. The room was small which is normal for nyc| but the thermostat was so dry i kept waking up to drink and hack a lung. It was the dryest hotel I've ever stayed at.. again it was the polar vortex so maybe not their fault but im wondering about their filter systems and such. The bed was comfortable but soo hot. I would unfortunately not stay here again :( we like the cambria and ace. Im sorry to write this but I wish i had read a review about the bedbugs prior to booking :(,Feb 2| 2019,2
Everything was terrific - very clean and comfortable| service was great!  Love the rooftop bar as well!,Feb 1| 2019,5
Location was ideal for my 2-day stay in NYC. Room was small but bed was very comfortable| bathroom was clean and relatively spacious| TV options (including HBO) were good. Quiet except for street noise that died down by midnight. I didn't patronize the restaurant/bar but menu looked good and it was an attractive space.,Jan 31| 2019,4
I had such an awesome time. Professional service thru out .,Jan 29| 2019,5
The hotel is nice and has a great rooftop bar. However| drinks are very expensive and kids are not allowed up to look at the view. Our room was very small and crowded for 4 of us but we made it work. And the room did not have a refrigerator or ice available| we did not like this at all. The mini bar should be replaced with a refrigerator.,Jan 28| 2019,4
It was absolutely freezing in the hotel during the coldest two days of the season. The thermostat on the wall was useless. I turned the heat up and the fan yet there was no change in the heat in the room. It wasn’t just my room either. Colleagues of mine had drinks at the lobby bar and had to wear their jackets to be even remotely comfortable.,Jan 27| 2019,2
I. am disabled and I had difficulty maneuvering with my walker.  I had the occasion to fall twice in my room and service came to help me up.  Fortunately I wasn't hurt.  They saw I had a problem with my walker so they provided me with a wheelchair| which help tremendously. When I left two employees from the desk assisted me in getting to my car service.  I call that service beyond duty.  I highly recomend this hotel.,Jan 25| 2019,5
Great location and hotel,Jan 23| 2019,5
Nice place| had everything I needed.   Great central location.  Will stay there again.,Jan 22| 2019,5
Great location| room was clean and staff was friendly.,Jan 22| 2019,5
Nice clean room for two nights in Manhattan. Close to the Chelsea Art Galleries| and a short uber ride everywhere else.,Jan 21| 2019,5
Everything was good. My only complaint was the lack of a towel bar by the sink in the bathroom.,Jan 20| 2019,4
Excellent check in| nice room| high floor| not much of a view| no bathtub but excellent shower-Parking on street around the corner-no complaints!,Jan 11| 2019,5
Great location and it was quiet at night. It needs some interior renovation. Finishes are outdated.,Jan 11| 2019,3
Check-in at this hotel was terrible. The person at the front desk kept glaring at me and my friend through the whole check-in process. She made us feel like we were a waste of her time and energy. She kept rolling her eyes and sighing the whole time. On top of that| none of the additional charges (ie. the room security) were explained to me when I saw that my total went up. Luckily| I did find someone the next day that explained the rules concerning the charge.,Jan 9| 2019,3
The view was the best part I found myself sleeping with the window shades open so I could see it all as I fell asleep. I was on the 20th floor definitely recommend!! You could still hear sounds of the city but it just added to the experience. The room was nice and decent sized very comfortable bed and pillows.,Jan 9| 2019,5
Friendly helpful desk service,Jan 6| 2019,5
I chose it for the good location and price.  The room was small but well-appointed and efficient.,Jan 6| 2019,5
Beautiful room & hotel. Great Price Will definitely stay here again if I need to stay in the city,Jan 5| 2019,5
The hotel was clean| however I paid for bath robes included with my stay| when I asked for the bathrobes they told me "someone will bring them up. However| no bathrobes were brought to my room and when I asked again they said they did not have any. There wasn't a fridge or a microwave in the room. The morning staff and early afternoon staff are very pleasant and knowledgeable about their job duties and what they hotel offers. The late night staff aren't as pleasant| they do their job but make you feel as if you shouldn't have asked or you would rather do without. For example getting ice and my bathrobes. The overall experience was great no one bothered us and house keeping was very respectful. I would return again and recommend this hotel. The restuarant was clean and the food was good. We didn't get to enjoy the rooftop area| but I truly believe it would have been fun. Although I wasn't informed about the rooftop being closed during my stay before I paid for it. We just went to another rooftop bar/lounge.,Jan 5| 2019,4
LOCATION WAS KEY. EASILY GET TO ANY PART OF THE CITY,Jan 5| 2019,5
Always enjoy staying at this hotel and love the location,Jan 4| 2019,5
The rooms are cozy but well laid out with large flat screen TV| K-cup coffee and and outstanding shower with hot hot water. Nice view of empire state building and a great location near the action in mid town Manhattan but not in the middle of the action (i.e.| not too close to Times Square),Jan 4| 2019,5
It was a very nice trip. Would stay again however at 6pm when we got into town our room wasn’t ready and we had to wait for it to be cleaned when we were told checknin was at 3,Jan 3| 2019,4
Nice hotel | small rooms . Shower floor was dirty .,Jan 2| 2019,4
Very pleasant staff!  Room was small but just was we needed 😊,Jan 2| 2019,5
Front desk amazing customer service.  Rooms great size and very clean.  Room service fast and sweet.,Jan 2| 2019,5
The room was very big unlike the ROW. WE WE went on rooftop for New Year’s Eve party. The party was good and played good music. Many people cane casual. I wore a gown. I was more dressed up. I think there should be address code in a 4 star hotel for NY eve.,Jan 2| 2019,5
Honestly no comments it was ok nothing big about this parking fee way too high for the price you would expect breakfast or something. Snack overpriced smh,Jan 1| 2019,3
I loved the neighborhood| Chelsea| and how easy it was to get everywhere on the subway. My favorite part was all the great places to eat around here.  Nice people too.,Jan 1| 2019,5
good location and rooftop bar was cool but quiet. Staff gave no attention to anyone and rooms were small Typical for NYC. nothing made this a unique hotel.,Dec 30| 2018,3
We stayed at the Hilton for five nights.  Overall| for the price point it was a great choice.  And we liked the midtown location.,Dec 29| 2018,4
Location is ideal for shows and events at Madison Square Garden and Rockefeller Center| which we took in on this visit. The hotel is clean and compact| like others we've used in Midtown. Staff were friendly and helpful. Restaurant was good for the one meal we ate there. But the room| though no smaller than those in competing hotels| had tired| gloomy decor.,Dec 29| 2018,3
Very clean and great location.  Stafff was friendly and very helpful,Dec 28| 2018,5
The check in was very lackluster. The front desk staff made us feel as if we were a burden to them when we were checking in. The room was alright nothing special at all. I was disappointed with the overall experience being a Hilton.,Dec 28| 2018,3
The staff was very professional and thoughtful. They made us feel welcomed| they were very helpful and approachable.,Dec 28| 2018,5

Staff was EXCEPTIONAL!! Very helpful and friendly. Very cool rooftop bar but have to be 21 to go up there. Rooms are small but that’s too be expected in NYC!!,Dec 23| 2018,5
We enjoyed every bit of our stay Had to get used to being in such a small room| but this is NYC| right? That aside| everything was great.,Dec 23| 2018,4
Such a great stay. Staff  was amazing. I go to basketball games every year. I will now call that place my new hotel.,Dec 23| 2018,5
Great location| friendly staff. Rooms were very clean!,Dec 16| 2018,4
Room was much smaller than I expected but it was clean and cozy. It was inconvenient to have to call the front desk for ice since there was no ice machine on the floor.,Dec 14| 2018,4

Very clean and comfortable Beautiful hotel| just a little too cold for my personal preferences.,Dec 10| 2018,4
The hotel was in a great location| service was great| and beds were comfortable.,Dec 10| 2018,4
The lighting in the room was extremely poor| the bathroom's was better. The hotel met our basic needs for one night| nothing outstanding about it. The bathrooms of the restaurant in the lobby were in deplorable condition. The front desk staff was very attentive| helpful and nice.,Dec 9| 2018,3
This is my second time staying at this hotel. The staff is friendly and accommodating. The elevators are pretty quick and parking and finding an Uber is easy. The rooms are clean but the lighting is bit dim in the room. Other than the lighting| I would deff recommend this hotel.,Dec 9| 2018,4
The property is very nice and conveniently located. Check in was flawless and the room very nice with a comfortable king bed. My only disappointment was that there was not a complimentary water| everything in the mini bar was a charge.,Dec 8| 2018,5
Contemporary  look...and convenient  location to everywhere....awesome pillows.....clean restrooms......you made the block look good because it could look better,Dec 5| 2018,5
Just very easy. Smooth to check in| left luggage there all day| easy to check out.,Dec 3| 2018,5
Small rooms| not a lot of amenities| not the best neighborhood,Nov 27| 2018,3
I wish I had the time to check out the rooftop bar.,Nov 27| 2018,5

It was in a location easy to get transportation and centrally located to all of the places we planned on being.,Nov 5| 2018,5
Close enough to midtown to be easily walked yet far enough from the action to be quiet and charming.Great service| good accommodations| overall very satisfied.,Nov 5| 2018,5
Nice hotel close to where we needed to be.  Our only complaint was that the mattress was uncomfortable.,Oct 30| 2018,4
We checked in on Saturday evening for a one night stay. This full-service hotel is very well located| just a few short blocks from Madison Square Garden and many other NYC places to see. The front desk staff were AMAZING and went out of their way to make sure we were quickly checked in and settled.  Our room was clean| neat and comfortable. The one downside was there was no hot water in the shower the next morning.  At checkout| we reported this to the front desk staff and they were extremely apologetic| assured us that this would be looked into| and bought us breakfast so to make up for this issue.  We gracefully excepted the free meal and went on our way.  I would stay here again for sure| but will be sure to check the hot water before settling in!,Oct 29| 2018,4
Very comfortable and conveniently located to the train and sightseenig stops we planneds for on our trip,Oct 28| 2018,4
The hotel was centrally located for what I wanted to do. It was perfectly located. Check in with efficient and friendly; the room was clean and check out was efficient as well. Very satisfied with our stay there.,Oct 27| 2018,5
The hotel room was adequate| a bit noisy. They moved me to another room on day 2| then I woke up with no hot water in the building (overnight) with no ETA before I checked out.,Oct 25| 2018,4
Only problem was the thermostat in the room. Could not get the room below 77. It was hotttttt,Oct 24| 2018,4
Great locationClean and comfortable Staff were very customer oriented,Oct 16| 2018,5
No hot water for 2 days| my keys to my room didn’t work for 2 days| at times only 1 elevator worked| room service (breakfast) was awful.,Oct 13| 2018,1
No hot water for two days of my stay. Had to escalate the issue to Hilton to get a room transfer and refund| local management said it was 'hard' to do a refund when paid in advance (through Expedia) and they had no other rooms availability. Both of these things magically changed after the mother ship called them on my behalf. Very poor service| full of excuses and no action.,Oct 13| 2018,1
Much smaller than expected.  The 1st day we had a problem with the shower pipe| the water wouldn't go down and nasty black water came back up| luckily they fixed it fast| but still it was very nasty.,Oct 12| 2018,3
Great location| super clean and friendly staff. Can't wait to stay there again in a few weeks.,Oct 12| 2018,5
Nice enjoyed this location and the staff.  Central location in Manhattan close to everything,Oct 9| 2018,5
Rooms were very nice and clean. Beds very comfortable. The hotel lobby small and loaded with bags/suitcases being held for people. Check in and valet for car a breeze. Early check-in accomodated. All in all a good experience and a do-over.,Oct 8| 2018,4
Great location| we were only in the room to sleep.,Oct 7| 2018,4
the bed in the room wasn’t at all comfortable and there were tiny bugs in the room!!!,Oct 4| 2018,2
Outstanding! Every staff member we met went above and beyond in friendliness and professionalism. Hotel was immaculate and comfortable.,Oct 2| 2018,5
The location is awesome the hotel is clean the staff was friendly,Sep 30| 2018,5
Great NYC location. Just Two blocks from Penn Stattion.  Room was pristine.,Sep 26| 2018,4
Really really nice! Great staff| came in to laughs and smiles. The bed was INCREDIBLE| I had trouble leaving the bed. Loved it,Sep 23| 2018,4
Arrived early am on redeye. No room available at about 8 am.  I understand that. Checked bag at Hotel and left - received call around 10 am from front desk while walking around NYC that a room became available. I said great - assumed they’d bring my bag to it. Was told there’d be a separate $25 charge for early check-in. Never experienced this before. Ridiculous concept.,Sep 21| 2018,3
New York was nice. The night views were amazing but there was a very strange and uncomfortable smell in most parts of Manhattan- I found that quite displeasing. The smell would hit you as soon as you walked out of the hotel. But overall amazing experience.,Sep 20| 2018,4
Location of the hotel is very good but the room was too small. There could be welcoming gifts in the room especially for late comers.,Sep 18| 2018,3
The room was in front of elevator| lots of noise!Also it was cold and they don’t have heaters till November!,Sep 11| 2018,2
Hotel location is very good. Room is big and clean with good condition.,Sep 5| 2018,5
The hotel was decent. A little outdated but the rooms were clean and the staff was friendly. I wish there was more lighting in our room. Overall| not a bad place to stay for a short trip given the location.,Sep 3| 2018,4
I am all a out cleanliness and friendliness of staff! In  my grading card 4 **** :)  rooms are a bit small but okay and expected for NYC. Satisfied ...within walking distance of Time Square!,Sep 2| 2018,4
Nice and very quiet for Manhattan area.  Good hotel| great location.,Sep 1| 2018,4
Love the location.  We could walk to many places.Easy check in,Sep 1| 2018,4
Nice hotel| clean and modern room| great location to Penn Station and Comedy club| bars| restaurants.,Aug 31| 2018,5
Great location - decent room size . Friendly staff. Shout out to Mary at the Front desk . Clean safe area - used to love in NYC . Parking expensive and had a little issue with a broken side mirror but hotel and front desk manager were right on it . Look for special deals !!,Aug 29| 2018,5
Noise from street reaches as high as 8th floor. Not okay for family stay as the rooms are very small| bathroom shower is very small. No exhaust fan in bathroom. Okay to crash after a bar hopping night out. Weekends tend to be noisiest when mostly drunk people wander in the lobby.,Aug 28| 2018,1
Very quiet room| comfortable beds| courteous helpful staff.,Aug 28| 2018,4
Very convenient location| good rates| friendly staff| nice room.,Aug 27| 2018,5
Really bad hotel| to expensive| I’m a regular flying to the city and with less money I already stay in better hotels in the area.,Aug 27| 2018,1
Great location| and great staff. A little pricey for the extras but it's NYC so it's expected. Nice hotel,Aug 26| 2018,5
Good location|  nice roof top area  & restaurant!!,Aug 21| 2018,4
It was our 1st time in the Big Apple and in this Hilton Hotel. We stayed for 3 nights in 2 double beds room. Our first room on the 12th floor was small and has a weird| bad smell. We told the front rep gentleman (didn’t get his name) about the problem and he was very nice and moved us without hesitation to the 15th floor where the room was a little bit bigger and didn’t smell. Our room didn’t have a nice view of the Empire State Building which I was hoping for. But I guess you have to pay more for a higher floor in order to get a nice city view. We didn’t get to see the rooftop bar either because when we finally got the chance to go on a Friday night close to midnight| I was told they close at 12 midnight. I was hoping it would close later than that because it was weekend but they said it closes at midnight due to the noise. Overall| our stay was great. Beds are comfortable (except my mom was complaining the covers and the pillows smell)| and the bathroom was nice with a glass door shower area. Could have been better if our room had a nice city view. The view outside our hotel window was only a boring brick office building.,Aug 20| 2018,4
Our stay was great for our first time stay in a NYC hotel,Aug 20| 2018,5
Hotel staff was very judgemental as soon as you approached them not a very friendly vibe at all!,Aug 14| 2018,3
Staff are really nice| the room was clean and we were able to check in early| which helped us a lot since we had kids with us.,Aug 13| 2018,5
Very good hotel,Aug 12| 2018,5
Beautiful hotel right downtown| good service| easy access,Aug 12| 2018,5
My stay here was fabulous. The staff was friendly and accommodating as I had arrived early and needed a place to store my bags. When it came time to check in| the process was extremely easy. I would definitely stay here again.,Aug 7| 2018,5
Hotel is very convenient.  Easy walk to Chelsea art galleries| restaurants and to the theater district.   Transportation  is also easily available.  Room was small but the bed was very comfortable. Everyone we spoke to was helpful and friendly.,Aug 6| 2018,4
The Hilton Fashion District is a nice hotel. It's actually on 26th St in Chelsea| Manhattan. I say Chelsea because it is one of the coolest parts of NYC. The hotel is within walking distance to Greenwich Village and all the great things there. It's even closer to the Flat Iron district. It's also close to Penn Station and the 34th street shopping experience. On a good day| anyone can walk to Times Square and the theaters. This hotel's biggest asset is location| location| location.The hotel has 22 floors| and a rooftop bar that was closed during my stay due to the almost 100° F temperatures. The rooms are small but elegantly appointed and the AC is excellent. Now| the only negative; hair in the bathroom. Whoever cleaned my room overlooked several hairs in the shower as well as on the bathroom floor.  Other than the hair issue I found this Hilton Fashion District to be a very good hotel. It has a small reception area and three high speed elevators.,Aug 6| 2018,4
Nice| but very small rooms. For this price I would have expected more.,Aug 6| 2018,3
Excellent hotel in excellent location. A few blocks away from Madison Square Gardens.,Aug 1| 2018,5
Great place| unfortunately rooftop BST was closed but other than that it rocked.,Jul 31| 2018,5
it was a good location,Jul 31| 2018,4
Staff behavior was terrible. Basic amenities that should be complimentary are unnecessarily paid.,Jul 31| 2018,2
Good central location.  Quiet room.  I would stay here again.,Jul 30| 2018,4
We were given a room on a side of the hotel facing a set of high walled buildings and outside fire exits  it was extremely dark| to the point where the room needed lights on at all times day and night. The room itself was very nice. The hotel had a much trailed rooftop bar. We tried to go up and were refused access on all three days and nights . very disappointing; I guess we weren't the correct sort of people to get to walk behind the rope and the 2 bouncers and the roped- off lift in our hotel lobby| the hotel we paid good money to stay in. Left a very bad taste in our mouths.,Jul 28| 2018,3
Great spot one of my routine places to stay in NYC... great location walking distance to Penn Station... rooms a little small but Hilton quality.,Jul 28| 2018,5
It was not kid friendly. No pool for kids.   Our room is 2 nd floor with building wall view. We can’t go to roof top on day time or night time to see View| kids are not allowed.,Jul 28| 2018,3
It was overall good experience. However| the beds were not comfortable,Jul 23| 2018,4
This hotel is a great value. Comfortable beds and very quiet for being right in the city. The rooftop bar Rare is an awesome spot and a huge bonus.,Jul 17| 2018,4
The service of the entire staff but especially the Front Desk Staff is Fantastic!,Jul 9| 2018,5
Had a great experience| very clean and very friendly staff. For the price| couldn’t have asked for any better.,Jul 8| 2018,5
The hotel in and of itself is not bad however for the outstanding price little things like 3/5 days without a security safe| mini fridge or even a closet to store clothing is very disappointing.I understand that it's Manhattan and space is at a premium but there are basic expectations from a hotel and the above were very disappointing. Furthermore| the hand sprayer in the shower did not even work.On the positive| the staff was very good for what they had to work with and the location was good/very close to the 28th St. station and the Red-1 for easy access to uptown and downtown.,Jul 8| 2018,3
Nice hotel went for 4th of July close to fireworks on the bridge and close to Times Square...would like a refrigerator to be in the room and ice maker to keep drinks,Jul 6| 2018,5
Great location| wonderful friendly staff| super clean and comfortable. Highly recommended!!!,Jul 4| 2018,5
staff was friendly.Beds were comfortable.No problem as far as I know.,Jul 3| 2018,4
My stay was fantastic.  The room was comfortable| clean and quiet (the quiet part isn't that important to me but I know it is for others).  The neighborhood is vibrant and has plenty of nearby resources (restaurants| convenience stores| drug stores| etc).  The staff is friendly and helpful and they have a rooftop bar!,Jun 26| 2018,5
Clean| modern| great location.,Jun 25| 2018,5
Do not disturb sign at the door couldnt stop maids enetring the room 3 times !Noise level is very high from inside as well as from the streetHotel charged me 66.54 extra.for no reason whatsoever. I didnt use mini bar. Checked out on time. Accounting department is non existant. They dont pick up their phones and mailbox is full. No More Hilltons!,Jun 23| 2018,2
Hotel is not as close to Times square| gotta walk far to get to 42nd or 44th st.Hotel is also not close to Chelsea Pier.  Its still about a mile to walk.There is no refrigerator or microwave in the room.Staff were nice| helped me warm up food and necessities.Clean room.  Bathroom ok| water leaks thru the glass door though (when taking shower).Safe place to stay.,Jun 20| 2018,3
Close to Macy’s and all of the Fashion Districtis a short walk away!,Jun 18| 2018,5
Nothing to complain about! Excellent stay and magnificent view of the city from our 21st floor room!,Jun 11| 2018,5
Hotel is good for business or tourism with no frills. Functional rooms that aren’t the most comfortable but are sufficient.,Jun 10| 2018,3
The staff was friendly and very helpful! Thanks!,Jun 10| 2018,5
Location was great. Room was great. The rooftop bar was never open when we wanted to go. We tried to valet our rental car but the street was closed and the desk clerk didn’t mention it when I called to ask about valet pricing. Then offered street parking as an alternative. Very frustrating. We went 6 blocks away and paid an independent garage the $58.,Jun 10| 2018,5
Excellent| clean and comfortable.  Would definitely recommend.,Jun 9| 2018,5
Location is great. Close to Chelsea Market. Our bartender at Rare was fabulous! Natalie couldn’t have been more professional| kind and engaging. Made our last night in NYC even more special:),Jun 4| 2018,4
Nice room with clean restroom. Shower head placement/shower door is odd in that you can’t turn on the shower from the front of the stall| the opening is only at the back.,Jun 3| 2018,5
Good location| freindly staff| clean room. Room on smaller side and no ice bucket/machine.,Jun 1| 2018,5
Attentive staff| very responsive valet parking attendant. Great location Chelsea close to subways and Flatiron district.,May 29| 2018,4
Location is great !!! Staff friendly and polite. Cleanliness was terrible !!! Found hair in various places of beds| had to talk to the mañager,May 26| 2018,3
property was ok....walls are paper thin and a lot of noise from the hall way etc etc...location ok also..the breakfast| I would leave and buy elsewhere| otherwise ok to stay at.,May 16| 2018,3
This is a nice place to stay in NY without costing a fortune. The staff is very nice and the hotel restaurant is really good too. I would definitely stay here again.,May 15| 2018,4
This hotel was just what I was looking for. The location was perfect. Not to far from any of the tourist stuff but also not in the middle of it either. Felt like I could live there. The hotel staff was great and very helpful. The hotel was very clean and I was happy with the condition of the hotel overall. This is one of the best hotels that I have stayed at in my years of traveling.,May 5| 2018,5
My trip was average. This hotel is fine but definitely needs a facelift.,May 3| 2018,3
The room and the hotel overall was really nice. My only problem was the room was small and tight. The staff were wonderful and really helpful!,Apr 30| 2018,5
Good location allows you to walk to parks| shopping and restaurants. Subway| bus and train access is close as well. Nice amenities in the room and comfortable bed.  Really enjoyed the rooftop bar| that is a plus.,Apr 29| 2018,5
We have stayed 4 nights in double room. The room was very comfortable for 3 people. The staff was very attentive and always happy to assist. I my only suggestion is to arrange for better lighting as It was too dark in the evening.,Apr 28| 2018,5
Todo muy bien,Jul 24| 2021,5

El hotel es sencillo pero cuenta con todo lo necesario para una agradable estancia en NYC| cerca de 2 líneas de Subway y de lugares de interés. El restaurante-bar del Skyroof tiene una gran vista el Empire State y es super agradable. Limpio| en excelente estado y con un personal amable. Sin duda volveremos ahí.,Jun 21| 2021,5

Nära till pennstation så enkelt att ta tåget till och från flygplatsen. De renoverade på takterrassen så det va väl det som drog ner på renligheten lite. Bra standardhotell som ligger väldigt bra till.,Mar 10| 2020,4
Goed ligging| behulpzame medewerkers| goed bevallen.,Mar 2| 2020,4
Vi hade en bra vistelse på Hilton! Rummet var rent och fräscht . Inte så stort men det är sällan rummen i New York. Restaurangen var stängd för renovering| men det gjorde mig inget. Vi åt istället på något av alla små mysiga ställena i kvarteret. Kan särskilt nämna frukosten på Sunac Fancy Foods och kaffet på Gregorys Coffee. Det ligger mängder av matställen nära| och även en Whole Foods. Vi saknade dock ett kylskåp på rummet| det hade varit bra. Men läget är som sagt fantastiskt. Vi kunde gå till nästan alla de ställen vi ville ta oss till. Här kan jag absolut bo igen!,Feb 28| 2020,4
Great location with lots of restaurants and shopping nearby. Close to subway stations.Staff always warm and friendly,Feb 27| 2020,5
Utrolig imødekommende og venlig personale| som ønsker at gøre alt for den bedste oplevelse. Vi fik endda senere udtjekning på afrejsedagen uden meromkostninger. Vi havde nogle lækre dage på hotellet| med en storslået udsigt over skyline fra 22 etage. Det lægger perfekt i midttown| tæt på alt og området i sig selv er meget sikkert.,Feb 25| 2020,5
Struttura piacevole abbastanza pulita non all'altezza degli Hilton che ci sono in Italia| posizione comoda e tranquilla.,Feb 25| 2020,4

Estimados|Escribí en español mi inglés es no es tan bueno| me gusta Hôtel y está en buena ubicación y voy a regresar de vuelta| pero hay dos puntos importantes que quería resaltar: hisopo  si la persona anterior no usó el paquete completo no pueden dejar para otro huésped no es permitido por higiene| y otro punto: el cartel de no molestar que se cuelga en la puerta deben tener en cada habitación yo debería prestar a otra. Gracias,Feb 17| 2020,4
Me gustó bastante el hotel y creo que es lo que esperaba al ser un Hilton| no está ubicado en la mejor calle pero tampoco es la peor. La habitación mePareció cómoda. Solo ten cuidado con el Mini Bar| lo tocas por curiosidad y ya sacaste un producto que te cobrarán después obvio. En general le pondría un 9 de 10 👍,Feb 10| 2020,4

Nous avions pris etage supérieur| nous étions ainsi au 18 eme étage sur 22| avec vue superbe sur l’empire State building. Insonorisation bien| literie bien aussi. Pour le roof top| il faut bien penser à prendre sa carte de chambre et carte d'identité pour y aller| l’accès se fait depuis le hall de l’hôtel à partir d’un ascenseur dédié. Nous avons testé le restaurant| très bon ! Et agréable de rester sur place après une longue journée.Personnel à l’écoute et sympathique.Hôtel très bien placé| à pied de l’empire state building pour faire la visite de nuit  ç’était Top!Très beau séjour.,Jul 11| 2019,5
Die Lage vom Hotel ist super. Wir waren viel zu Fuß unterwegs. Subway ist in der Nähe. Supermärkte sind auch gleich um die Ecke. Straßen waren sehr dreckig und stinkig.,Jul 9| 2019,4
Das Hotel eignet sich gut für einen dienstlichen oder privaten Aufenthalt.Sehr zentral und eine Subway Station in der Nähe.Personal war freundlich und zuvorkommend.Sauberkeit ist ok| aber nicht perfekt.Der Standard entspricht dem US Hilton Standard| für mich absolut ausreichend.Für NY Verhältnisse große Zimmer| die Tür könnte besser gedämmt sein.Das Frühstück / Gym habe ich nicht genutzt.,Jul 6| 2019,5

28平米でダブルベッド二つの部屋を予約したのですが変形した部屋でスーツケースを2人分開くスペースが無いくらい狭く開放感のない部屋でした。エアコンはよく効いたので寒い思いをしなくて良かったです。フロントの対応はいまいちでした。4つ星クラスのようですが、総合的に見て3〜3.5レベルです。チェルシーマーケットに徒歩18分ほどで行けますし、Whole Foods MarketやTrader Joe'sも近くにあるので立地はいいです。,Jan 8| 2019,3
특별히 친절하지도 서비스도 없는 호텔입니다. 4박5일 머물렀는데| 잠만 자고 방에 오래 머물르지 않고 관광다니기에는 괜찮습니다. 방이 좁고 4층이라 전망이 좋지 않았지만| 매일 청소를 깨끗이 해주어 편안하게 있었습니다.  근처 첼시마켓과 휘트니 뮤지엄이 가까워 걸어갈 수 있는 거리고| 지하철역이랑 버스정류장도 근처에 있어 이동이 편리합니다.  바로 앞에는 편의점이 없고 조금 걸어 길건너에 whole food market이 있고 바로 건너 CROMPTON ALE HOUSE 가 음식이 아주 맛있고 맥주도 아주 좋습니다.,Jan 5| 2019,3

Room was dusty| we found medicine on the floor and informed the staff and nobody reacted. Service was weird| really really not a four star service| where you expect everything to be handled easily. Hotels.com there is said bathrobes| there were no bathrobes. We chose the hotel to have a sure quality (no fove star) hotel to have everything work out easily and because of the location. This was not it. I would not recommend this hotel in NYC.,Jan 3| 2019,2

Super zentrale Lage und sehr nettes Hotelpersonal. Es ist auf jeden Fall eine Empfehlung,Dec 4| 2018,4
Bra hotel med fantastisk utsikt fra topp etasjene. Rommene er kanskje litt små| men sengene er veldig god å ligge i. Dyr frokost.,Nov 24| 2018,4
Gute Lage. Leider sehr laut. Von der Straße aus| als auch vom Innern. Sehr laute Türen und sehr laute Heizung.,Nov 19| 2018,4
Conveniently located to many great restaurants and sight seeing places like the flatiron building. Service was good and the room was better than expected. Great views from the rooftop! I would stay again at this hotel.,Oct 27| 2018,4
Hilton sendo Hilton! Excelente atendimento| quarto excelente e muito confortável como sempre.,Sep 23| 2018,5
Bellissimo Hotel| bella camera pulita e con tutti i servizi| nei piani alti bellissima vista| comodo per la visita della citta.,Aug 28| 2018,5
Questa è la quarta volta che torniamo in questo albergo.Camere abbastanza ampie per essere a NY (pagando un extra)| personale molto gentile e soprattutto posizione ideale per muoversi per Manhattan senza bisogno della metropolitana.Purtroppo però devo dire che avrebbe bisogno di un po’ di manutenzione| perché in camera abbiamo trovato tende bucate e rotte ed evidenti segni di umidità in bagno.,Aug 27| 2018,3
The location was convenient and close to many attractions within walking distance. However| there were cockroaches in the room. We reported the issue| and no resolution. Additionally| elevator service was prolonged. We were waiting almost 20 mins for an elevator| and walking downstair with luggage from the 38th floor was not an option.,Aug 16| 2021,3
The location was perfect,Aug 16| 2021,5
Great Hotel| near to Battery park| Walstreet| 9/11 Memorial(One world Trade center). Front desk staff at the hotel is very professional.,Aug 7| 2021,5
Rooms and halls are too small. Front desk person not friendly.,Aug 3| 2021,3
Took forever to check in| they seemed to have lost our reservation| the next day our room keys were disconnected and no longer worked to open our rooms| and it always took forever for the elevator to come (3 elevators for 40  floors is insufficient),Aug 3| 2021,2
Elevators were very slow| no valet parking| lobby on 2nd floor| room was very very small| construction all around hotel| the only good thing was the staff were nice,Jul 31| 2021,2
Liked location but they lied about the price of room.,Jul 31| 2021,1
Not new but decent place to stay at the location if the prices are on discount. The elevators are always busy but acceptable generally for tourists. Room is nice and clean. Staffs are kind of friendly. Amenities are excellent!,Jul 30| 2021,4
I didn't like the elevator situation.  Very crowded and hard to get on.  The fees for parking were outrageous.,Jul 29| 2021,4
Everything with the hotel was fine and is beautiful| just the parking lot is not good.,Jul 26| 2021,5
Using COVID as an excuse to not do housekeeping is fabricated. Finally got housekeeping on Day 4 after requesting for three days in a row. More likely the property is struggling with staff shortages but tell me that at check in then I j set stand the problem,Jul 21| 2021,3
If you want a hotel because location this is good because is close to vessel| little island| statue liberty and color museum. If the hotel is for relax…. Noooo is terrible| dirty| staff can’t constantly clean your room because| not enough towels just 2 and we are 5| you call to guest service and you request something and you need to call again and again,Jul 20| 2021,5
This place was a mess!,Jul 20| 2021,1
The rooms were extremely small| could barely walk in there.,Jul 20| 2021,3
Great location| we love it.,Jul 20| 2021,4
Great Downtown location| close to main attractions| good food| and subway stations to explore everything around.I do believe in treating people well and you get the same back. The staff was friendly and attentive to the needs.,Jul 19| 2021,4
Was decent| very close to the subway and battery park| elevator wait was long at times| but was moderately priced so you get what you pay for,Jul 19| 2021,4
My AirPods were stolen and nothing was done about it.,Jul 19| 2021,1
The rooms were comfortable and clean. Large lobby. Registration was helpful and attentive.,Jul 19| 2021,5
What a disappointment!! Tiny room| uncomfortable No parking| we had to pay $77 per night for parking and you have to take everything out of your car with you! It was a pain. Never again,Jul 17| 2021,2
It was centric I did not liked the size of the rooms its a Double Tree not a boutique hotel! employees need customer service training because they are kind of rude.,Jul 13| 2021,2
This hotel was clean and very pretty| perfect for our short stay. Two minor details I didn’t like: there are only two elevators that were typically packed all the time. Also| the AC wasn’t cooling enough shared spaces and it was hot when waiting for the lift.,Jul 12| 2021,5
Stayed longer than planned because I get comfortable. That says a lot about this place.,Jul 12| 2021,5
Clean... Would be nice if breakfest was incld,Jul 12| 2021,3
The rooms are extremely small the hotels say the bed is a queen size but it is definitely a full so place accordingly. The hotel had 44 floors and Only two elevators. Huge inconvenience!!! There is a 30 to 45 minute wait for the elevator so please make adjustments.,Jul 12| 2021,1
Rooms are clean but extremely small| limited amenities| not high end| but satisfactory for a one night stay,Jul 12| 2021,4
NA,Jul 12| 2021,4
Amazing,Jul 11| 2021,5
Decent hotel| good prices for area.Poor elevator wait times for size of building.,Jul 8| 2021,4
This hotel was so small| it was obviously squeezed between two buildings. The rooms are absolutely tiny and the bathrooms are worse. The toilet paper was touching the toilet because there was no room!,Jul 6| 2021,3
Room cleaning is only on request. You must inform well in advance. No trash receptacles on floors. Only 3 small elevators for 44  floors. Be prepared for spending total of 30 minutes at elevators each day| if you go up an down more than a couple of times. Rent was okay| I was paying for the location.... the hotel by itself is not so much worth the rent.,Jul 6| 2021,3
The hotel was nice and close to things but they have issues with their elevators. We were on floor 26 and most of the time we took the stairs which was not convenient especially with luggage. The staff was nice.,Jul 6| 2021,3
Great location| nice staff.,Jul 5| 2021,5
We accidentally planned the trip during NYC Pride weekend| so we didn't have a lot of options for lodging. So here we are. The room itself was okay - beds were comfy and air condition worked well. Worth noting that the room was small - if we had big luggages there was no way we would have been able to open them without them taking up all the floor space. The location was great - near a lot of restaurants| battery park| Wall St and the metro. Starbucks and Gregory Coffee were right around the corner which was nice for the AM. Front desk staff was friendly. However| the bathroom was not as clean as it should have been. There was hair on the stall walls| dirt and stains in the crannies of the corners and across the walls| and one of the lights wasnt working. Another huge issue was the elevator. IT TOOK FOREVER. We were on the 33rd floor and it easily took us 15-20 min from when we pressed the button to go down to when we actually made it to the lobby. 45  floors and only three elevators and one was closed half the time we were there. Because of this| people PACKED into elevators and it was very uncomfortable.It's a good for a short weekend stay but I would not stay longer than two nights - there are better options around.,Jul 2| 2021,3
No blankets or comforters on site| so we were left qith only 2 thin sheets on the bed. The AC times out randomly| so the room temperature was never constant. The staff was not very friendly.,Jul 2| 2021,3
Very disappointed. The room assigned to me was not up to my expectation. Coffee maker|refrigerator not working properly. The bathroom plug was cracked needed to be changed. After several minutes of personal back and forth with front desk person in charge was finally offered an upgrade. I dont think there was any upgrade. Only a change of room to a much higher floor. I dont think this was an upgrade|the room and bathroom looked exactly the same except for the higher floor. The bed in the original room was not made| Later after complaining was told that because of covid 19 security no no one would enter room to make beds. The bright spot was the help we received from a staff person named Harrison which was very attentive to our situation and helped us with our move to our new room on the 42nd floor. Not happy with our stay !!!,Jul 1| 2021,2
Room was nice| even had a mini fridge.  Location is great| centrally located in the financial district and by some great bars and restaurants.  One of the few hotels downtown with rooms with two beds.  Check in line was long since it was a Friday but moved fast.  Front desk employees were very nice.,Jul 1| 2021,5
No AC in the hallways or elevators. 1 elevator not working so over a 15-20 minutes wait to go up or down. Paid breakfast was a granola bar and canned fruit.,Jul 1| 2021,2
Stayed for a surprise engage trip for my gf,Jun 30| 2021,1
We never had toilet paper or towels— every time we called they made us come down to the front desk to get them and then they would send us back upstairs saying they would send it up (which they never did). Then I saw small roaches everywhere— they never came to empty our trash or clean the room. The elevators were super slow and always crowded— they took 10 minutes to come and we still couldn’t get on.,Jun 30| 2021,1
Getting to hotel was a nightmare since the street was closed. I had to call hotel and the worker wasn’t knowledgeable at all about where I was located to help me. I was actually just around the block too| which makes me think she was just rude. When I arrived| she was not friendly| when I left there were additional| unfriendly to say the least workers. The shower edges need to be cleaned and recaulked. The beds didn’t really fit the double bedroom| very squishy. I’ve stayed in better hotels in New York| so I was very disappointed from the arrival to departure. And it was very expensive.,Jun 26| 2021,4
Hotel is tough to find. I lived in the Financial District| and I still found it difficult to locate. It was also pretty noisy. It seems like it would quiet because it's basically in an alley| but the restaurant/bar across the street means it's far from peaceful on a Saturday night. We also had to deal with drunk people coming off of the elevator around 2 am| and they were quite belligerent.,Jun 26| 2021,3
Great place to stay!  Our room had a great view!!  That was so unexpected but very appreciated!  Staff was accommodating as well!,Jun 25| 2021,5
we enjoyed our stay here.  We felt safe and did not have any problems,Jun 25| 2021,5
The elevators were horrible| there are only 3 for 44 floors. Wait times for them were up to 10 minutes. The rooms were very small and we heard doors slamming all night.,Jun 24| 2021,3
they always charge me a damage fee($350) even though I never damage hotel rooms. they hold the money for THREE TO FIVE days after the hotel stay| even though I have stayed there 5 times and have no record of destroying hotel property.,Jun 22| 2021,2
Because of COVID they didn’t clean the room which was fine but always having to ask for things and go from a high floor down to the lobby was a pain I wish they would make it easier to get supplies and not feel so bad. Also it’s the only Doubletree I’ve been to that doesn’t have cookies! Otherwise the hotel was great!,Jun 22| 2021,4
I was put-off charging me $30 for an early check-in of about 3 hours.  The desk clerk's attitude was one of not caring less.  There were many open rooms and available when we arrived so letting us in the room early was not an issue.  Just one to stick it to the guest.  They charged this fee but wanted to not provide normal housekeeping services to room unless specifically requested.  No credit was given for that lack of service.  Also the elevators are a huge bottleneck getting up and down from the rooms at this hotel| regardless of the time.  Many times we took the stairs from the 12th floor after giving up waiting.  Most likely will not stay there again.,Jun 21| 2021,3
The hotel was pleasant I enjoyed my stay there| the staff were very helpful. there were a lot of things to do in the area|  A lot of different dining.  It just got really noisy at night Outside..,Jun 21| 2021,4
This hotel Hilton was most disappointing and I felt I was roomed in less than a Motel 6 or 8.  I was there for 6 days on the same sheets and had to make my own bed in the mornings for a comfortable sleep the next night for the whole six days.  As a military wife and a professional woman| I don't believe I have bedded in a worst condition of a hotel. I was given fresh towels when requested and they were delivered to the door.  The coffee tasted per cup as if there was not a full helping in the envelope.  And above all| the view was horrible.  I did get a chance to watch repair on the building in close proximity.,Jun 21| 2021,2
Room was clean yet really small. Only 3 elevators for 40 floors. Great location! Bellman/ Junior was very helpful,Jun 16| 2021,4
Great location. I like the proximity to where I needed to go and there were many restaurants and a Duane Reade nearby. I didn’t like the very slow pace of the elevator when there was a big crowd. There was no social distancing being enforced| although people were wearing masks.,Jun 16| 2021,4
staff was terrible,Jun 13| 2021,2
Good overall| they need more elevators!,Jun 12| 2021,4
The staff was very pleasant and accommodating. The rooms were not too big| but very comfortable and had amazing city views.. The small convenience / microwave area in the lobby was very nice to have!,Jun 11| 2021,5
Your elevator problem is beyond terrible.,Jun 11| 2021,4
Elevator wait time was 10 -15 mins at times. Check in was 45 later than normal due to computer issues,Jun 10| 2021,2
Very convenient location.,Jun 9| 2021,4
I did not stay there I stayed somewhere else.I did not realize I had actually booked this until I saw a charge on my credit card.I tried to call expedia but was waiting on the phone for 45 minutes with no response.Very disappointed and will never use Expedia again,Jun 8| 2021,1
Reserved a specific room (King size bed with city view). Upon arrival was given a “ story “ about water damage “ allegedly “ on floor of reserved room.Instead of being provided a room equal in all aspects was given a down size (twin room beds| no city view) for as stated “ same price.”,Jun 8| 2021,2
I like it was near the ferry.,Jun 8| 2021,4
The check-in took a very long time. There were not enough people to check in guests. Also| there are 3 elevators for a 40-story building. It took 30 minutes to get up and down from entrance to my room. The toilet kept running and the water from the shower leaked out onto the floor.,Jun 7| 2021,1
Great location for the price . Room was very clean !,Jun 7| 2021,5
Stayed there for 2 nights. My favorite part about the hotel is that the area was very convenient for tourists. The staff was really helpful. Lastly| the room was clean.,Jun 7| 2021,5
The Stay was ok.... Parking was overrated especially if your paying good money to stay somewhere,Jun 7| 2021,3
Room was filthy| small and uncomfortable | had to wait on average 30 min for elevator,Jun 6| 2021,3
This is a nice place to stay,Jun 3| 2021,4
Awesome,Jun 1| 2021,5
I liked the channel selections and I like the design of the bathroom I also loved the big bed and the staff was very polite and the cookies are super delicious.,Jun 1| 2021,5
I pre-paid for breakfast each morning to find out there was no breakfast. Also| told there would be no refund. The elevator system was absurd! To have 3 elevators that served 44 floors is RIDICULOUS!!,Jun 1| 2021,2
For 4 stars hotel is very bad,Jun 1| 2021,2
After checking in| it took us 45 min to get the room process to get to the room.Because with a 30 floor building only 1 elevator was functioning.  So each time to go up or down the wait could be as long as 20 to 30 minutes. So after the long frustrating wait with elevators upon entering the room found out that there were no blankets or comforter or bedspread on the beds. We called front desk who after many calls picked up and said there was no housekeeping at night and she will have to see if she can find any. After waiting for half hour we called front desk many times ( about 10 times) and then she picked up saying she found one blanket but we will have to come down. We had two double beds and wanted obviously two blankets. But my husband and I were prisoners in our room as the elevators took half an hour to go down to front desk. After frustrating wait for the elevator of half hour to go down to front desk I got a comforter with no apology. Stood for another 20 minutes to get an elevator to get to my 14th floor and found that the comforter was blood stained! At this point it was 1:00 amTired and exhausted with our travel and cause we had to get up early to receive our moving truck we went to bed at 1:15.,Jun 1| 2021,1
Great hotel on a very friendly and relax area. Citi Bikes are right around the corner and Battery Park is a quick walk away! Highly recommend it and if you like coffee| 787 Coffee at Pearl St is your place to go 🔥,May 31| 2021,5
I didn't like the pillows on my bed. Small and cheap. Because of this| we didn't had a good sleep.,May 31| 2021,4
I booked a king bed with a river view and got a tiny queen bed with no view. Staff said i got what Expedia sent to them. So I’m not sure who to blame or where to get my refund,May 30| 2021,2
Clean place. Love the location.,May 29| 2021,5
It advertised Breakfast but there was not even COFFEE.... For a High rise Hotel with 44  Floors having 2 of 3 Elevators down is Unsafe and Definitely a health Risk...I wanted to call the Health inspector or Fire Marshal to report but reconsidered because of the Hotel staff's Composure and poise in handling the influx of frustration ... Our Room of Two double beds was Seriously cramped ...(My Honest opinion),May 28| 2021,2
Wonderful staff and a clean environment love the stay,May 28| 2021,5
I stayed here for 12 days. As a long staying guest I was expecting great service| (which I guess as a guest I should expect regardless) however| it has been my worst stay at a hotel to date. First of all| the staff here at the reception is the poorest| most unhelpful| RUDEST staff I’ve ever seen in the hospitality industry. The staff was not helpful in anyway and would reply rudely and abruptly to any request or question. Since we were staying at the hotel for longer| we could get our room cleaned throughout the stay| we asked 5 times until someone cleaned the room and trust me when i say “clean”| it was just taking out the trash. There were also no soap| or toilet paper in the bathroom that I had to get down and get because there was no staff to bring anything to the room.Anyway| I can stand pretty much anything except for the rude staff here: they really left the most bitter taste in my mouth. I wish I hadn’t stayed here.,May 28| 2021,1
The staff was rude. The room wasn’t clean. Lights didn’t work in the room. The coffee maker had mildew and old water in it. Horrible for a Hilton property.,May 27| 2021,2
The lack of elevators made traveling to/from the upper levels complicated. There was always a line.Also i tried to get room service and they never answered.,May 27| 2021,2
Great quiet location close to several train stops.  Very convenient to reach my son in Brooklyn!,May 26| 2021,5
The staff was ok. They were polite when approached. Unfortunately| politeness did not fix the discomfort and inconvenience we experienced. The room's floor was dirty.  There was either dirt or sand on it. No hair dryer or coffee machine in room.  Ice maker on 17th and 14th floors not working. Had to walk from 17th floor to 7th floor to get ice because elevators were either busy or too slow. Check-in clerk did not inform us that housekeeping was not available unless requested the day before. Were asked to bring our own dirty towels/linens to reception to get new ones.  Did not offer to send anyone to pick up and drop off. Were supposed to get a clean comforter with clean towels| but front desk forgot the comforter.  Someone did end up bringing the clean comforter to the room so we would not have to go back downstairs to pick it up.,May 25| 2021,2
The hotel was nice| we enjoyed our stay. There could've been more towels initially in the room| we were only given two small ones. Also| it was so hot in the entire hotel. The hallways were like 100 degrees and so was our room. But once you put the air up one point| it gets freezing| it was never a comfy temperature. Wasn't too much of a problem though. It was in a nice area but the parking garage charged twice as much as they promised they would| so that was inconvenient. Also| once you parked your car in the lot you couldn't get anything out of it for 24 hours and we couldn't park it ourselves so we felt super rushed after driving 5 hours to get there. We had to leave our car at the entrance of the lot| give them the keys and grab and carry everything that was in the car| in a rush I forgot my bag with our toothbrushes and couldn't go back for 24 hours. I thought that rule was weird and I wasn't expecting to have to carry everything I own two blocks to the hotel. Usually| it's easily accessible to get anything from your car at any point so that was odd. Overall it was a nice hotel and I think 270$ for two nights is a steal| especially since we were close to times square and all the tourist attractions.,May 25| 2021,4
Excellent location| very nice hotel. Only caveats- the elevators are insanely slow and NOT air conditioned. When it’s 90| this is very apparent. Also| the music and whatnot from across the street is kinda loud- we were on 18 and could hear it all night but I still slept with no issues. Otherwise a great place to stay and kinda hidden too which we liked.,May 24| 2021,4
Room was extremely clean| beds were very comfortable. The elevators were crowded. Hallways smelled like weed| even though they were no smoking of any kinds signs everywhere. Guests were playing loud music in the middle of the night. Shower was amazing| very easy to use. We requested extra towels but never got them. Overall is a decent location| lot of access to subway| bus and free ferry.,May 24| 2021,5
Room small but good layout| efficient for one night for two people. Very comfortable beds. Issue with noise| dog barking from early morning and did call down to reception. Later when checking out we informed them again the dog was still barking| not sure the reception staff cared we were woken up. Overall the hotel is super clean and great location| the staff we met left a lot to be desired.,May 24| 2021,4
elevators slow lobby on 2nd floor amd too crowded,May 23| 2021,3
Small narrow street. Elevator was too slow.,May 23| 2021,3
As an asm,May 21| 2021,2
The staff was really nice but the building is older. I had issues with the water and well as a plastic bag was placed over the smoke detector.,May 19| 2021,1
Great area and staff was great,May 19| 2021,5
Crowded with party people. Loud at night. Scary fights late at night in the corridors. We were moved to a higher floor but the situation did not change| on the contrary.There are 3 elevators for a tower of 45 floors. We spent nearly 20 min to catch the elevator.,May 17| 2021,2
Good experience. Will definitely stay there again.,May 17| 2021,5
Great place love to stay with then again.,May 14| 2021,5
It was very relaxing and quiet. I enjoyed myself completely.,May 12| 2021,5
The staff was very very helpful.,May 11| 2021,5
Perfect location and really modern,May 10| 2021,5
The warm cookies at checkin were such a nice touch! The front desk staff responded quickly to our requests.,May 10| 2021,4
I wish I would have believed the other negative comments about the mattresses and the elevators. I will never stay in any DoubleTree again. 4 nights on their back braking lumpy uncomfortable mattresses is not what one needs after walking the city all day. Until this time I picked Hilton properties because of their unbelievable comfort| specially their mattresses and chairs. I woke up with a back pain 2-3 times each night. I never had a backpain in my life before. The elevators are a different story....Each day I ended up taking the stairs at least 1 or 2 times...BTW my room was on the 27th floor.....This is the first review I ever post| but my stay was so Terrible that it warrants it. In fact I intend to write a letter to their Corporate Office about my stay. My advise: Stay away and book the DoubleTree on Timesquare instead!,May 10| 2021,1
Parking across the street. Roughly around $40 overnight.,May 10| 2021,5
Booked a river view which is the reason I booked the room and I was told no river views available.  Now i am tired from traveling all day and had no other options.  Room was clean and nice but the river view was in memory of my father who lived and worked on that river in Jersey.,May 9| 2021,2
Disappointed,May 8| 2021,3
The double tree by Hilton really suprised me this go round I am from Florida and am located in the Orlando area and have visited a few hotels by the Hilton brand and these past two experiences with double tree has not been so great. When I checked in I went up to the room before bringing my luggage up as I always do just to make sure the room is clean and that the sheets are clean and that everything is functional. Well when I went up to the room first off the elevator smelled like urine which was a automatic first impression but when we walked into the room and turned on the water the water came out brown which was a no go for me especially because I was traveling with kids. The room was not stocked with the normal necessities like soap| shampoo| and the normal complimentary amenities that they give out . I asked for my room to be changed and the receptionist tried to tell me to just keep running the water that it will eventually stop coming out brown I declined and requested that my room be moved or that I want a refund and that took another hour so my experience was not good at all we were also missing the right side of the curtain to our window . Anyone looking to stay here with kids please be aware of the daily parking fee $35 for a car $45 for a suv and the homeless people that  are sleeping in the corner sides of the building and the hanging out at night  smoking weed from local residents. my husband and I Definitely will not be staying here again and do not recommend.,May 3| 2021,2
View of the River an d sundown. Priceless.,May 2| 2021,5
It was comfortable ! The staff were beyond friendly !,May 1| 2021,5
Ask for a city view. Put us on the 40th floor. When we fo to check we cant catch an elevator down. So we had to walk with luggage down 40 flights of stairs. Absolutely ridiculous that no one could call an day wait we have alarger group checking out at the same time we will call when the elevator are clear.,Apr 30| 2021,3
Property is in a good location and the price was very reasonable.,Apr 28| 2021,4
Great location,Apr 28| 2021,4
Solid location. Parking is cheap if you stay here which is a huge plus. Nice gym. No real issues. Run of the mill room.,Apr 26| 2021,5
Hotel room was pretty small but it did have a fridge which is always nice. They didn’t provide us with a trash can in the room or in the bathroom which was very odd and they didn’t do maid service due to COVID so we had various garbage around the room with no where to put it. The snacks in the small market were also insanely expensive. But the room itself was fine| small| but that is to be expected when staying in NYC. Overall is was far from the best place I’ve ever stayed but not the worst either.,Apr 26| 2021,3
Like most places in New York City the room was a little small but very comfortable for my wife and I. The staff was very nice and pleasant to deal with. The room was clean and everything in it functioned fine. the view from our room was also nice. We were on the 37th floor facing the river. We would definitely stay there again. The hotel was also pretty convenient to getting around. Great restaurants nearby and easy access to the trains.,Apr 26| 2021,5
no fridge or microwave in the room.,Apr 26| 2021,4
Clean and quiet.,Apr 26| 2021,5
There is no sound barrier between rooms. During our whole stay the couple next door kept arguing at awful times of the night and we could hear EVERYTHING. Elevato,Apr 26| 2021,2
The service is terrible and you can hear everyone in the room next to you. Only stay here if you’re comfortable wearing earplugs all night,Apr 25| 2021,1
Didnnot enjoynwalking down 41 flights of stairs,Apr 25| 2021,5
Check in is easy and they have a business center that is opened 24 hours which gives you access to a computer and/or a printer at your convenience.There is also indoor dinning and take-out options available for lunch and dinner.,Apr 25| 2021,5
Meh,Apr 25| 2021,2
Mediocre at best. Staff clearly have no clue what they’re doing. Rooms are super small| even for nyc standards. Air conditioning has a mind of its own and turns on randomly| very loud| thin walls. The location is nice if you want to be in FiDi. Overall I would never go back again.,Apr 25| 2021,2
The bed and the bathroom,Apr 22| 2021,5
Central location and good price.  The staff was helpful.,Apr 21| 2021,5
The ladies at the front desk were just rude and made you feel like you were an inconvenience or bothering them,Apr 20| 2021,2
Nothing,Apr 19| 2021,1
I didn’t like how you didn’t get fresh towels each day & the cleaning services didn’t attend to your room regularly.,Apr 19| 2021,4
Didn't like the off site parking and that the fees isn't one time pay and isn't included in reservations,Apr 18| 2021,4
front desk staff were welcoming patient and helpful and clearly enjoyed their job it was a pleasant end of a long day,Apr 16| 2021,5
Close to battery park,Apr 14| 2021,3
understand that due covid-19 service was challenging. Thinking outside the box would have come up with other approaches.  did not mind making up my bed| but not providing water or a easier method of getting soap| towels and would have been appropriate for a four start property.  Check with RIU and others to address their issue.,Apr 14| 2021,3
Friendly staff| clean rooms. Decent breakfast| at least for covid times. Would stay here again.,Apr 14| 2021,4
My room was nice!! My hotel stay was great. There’s a lot of grocery and restaurants nearby that you can walk to!,Apr 13| 2021,5
Grate service| love the stay. Hotel is clean and comfortable to stay in,Apr 13| 2021,5
We called for towels they said right away and never came.Rooms were very cramps,Apr 12| 2021,2
The location is good. The restaurant was not open there is no bar as advertised and we had free breakfast with our reservation but there was no free breakfast or even coffee. Very disappointing for a doubletree Hilton.,Apr 12| 2021,2
Very thin walls| one can hear literally everything what is going on at adjacent suite.,Apr 12| 2021,3
Anytime i come to this hotel i never get my deposit back will never come back again,Apr 12| 2021,1
The first room we were assigned was horrendous. There were so many things broken| tv| fixtures| etc. The second room had blood stained sheets and pillows that were not changed. The CSR| she was fabulous but this property was not what we expected for the price and hotel we chose. We told the csr upon checking out of our second dilemna and it didnt even bother them. Really disappointing.,Apr 12| 2021,2
The hotel room itself as well as location were fine but everything else wasn't. The elevators were incredibly slow and with only 3 of them| there aren't enough to serve 40 floors. Especially when entire flight crews are checking in and out on a regular basis. The walls inside the rooms are also paper thin and you can hear everything. There was one morning where a dog that was left inside someone's room barked constantly until people complained and hotel employees had to come and check it out. The service was also bad as I asked for towels at the 2nd floor reception and was told they had to be sent up and they never came and I was there for 2 more days after that. The location is the only thing worth praising as everything else is sub par.,Apr 11| 2021,2
Very clean and quite. Just little expensive for Snacks,Apr 11| 2021,5
I didnt like anything.  Due to covid rooms got cleaned days late and you had to leave the room.  I paid for a king bed and got a queen.,Apr 9| 2021,1
This is a great deal for NYC. Nicely located in the Financial District with easy access to various subways. The hotel has a restaurant| room service| and a gym so it has pretty good amenities. I have stayed here multiple times but always have an issue with the walls being paper thin you can hear people snore (or their TV| or conversation| or anything really) and it can be a bummer in the morning or when going to bed.,Apr 6| 2021,3
Their elevator service was very slow.  For the capacity and height of the building they need more elevators or streamline the use of their current elevators,Apr 5| 2021,3
Rooms were comfortable just alittle small and very narrow hallways| takes time for elevator even though there's 3 during check in and out times.,Apr 5| 2021,4
Nice hotel but minor things brought the value down| elevators were very slow| the room was clean to the naked eye but once you take a second look you notice all the flaws| Not very impressed considering to be in downtown Manhattan,Apr 5| 2021,3
The location is great| just a few blocks from historic places that have to be visited. The area is clean and safe. Rooms are small but clean and cozy (just for sleeping no space for visitors).No complaints at all. Guest service members are always smiling and showing they're glad to help you.. And the cookies are EXTREMELLY AWESOME; they are so good if you're on a diet you should try them because they are so good.Definitely our family wants to stay here again on our next New York visit.,Apr 5| 2021,5
A huge building and only one elevator was working.  They must do better with that. Otherwise| good stay.,Apr 4| 2021,4
Doubletree hotel is nice but the television doesn’t work!!! So both me and my wife stayed in a room that doesn’t have a working TV and their isn’t a microwave in the room as well which is disappointing as well. While trying to catch a elevator the staff says “you need to take the next one so move!!! Will I ever stay here again not at all plus it’s super difficult to even get WiFi as you have to sign up on the website just to receive free WiFi which is also annoying as well.,Apr 4| 2021,2
The rooms are tiny! It’s as if they took the pic from a spot to make it look spacious. What you don’t see simply isn’t there do not be fooled. The toilet was broken and we were told we could change room the next morning after 11-3pm.,Apr 2| 2021,2
This Double Tree location is staffed with very pleasant people. They are intentionally engaging with their guests and work hard to make you feel welcome. This heightened level of hospitality is essential considering how confining the dimensions of the property felt to me. I booked two rooms and they were both very small. The hallway to the elevators were very narrow and we could hear people in the adjacent rooms very easily. The food at the Italian restaurant onsite is very good however.,Mar 30| 2021,3
My stay was absolutely amazing.. the view was magical.. would definitely be going back.| thank you..,Mar 29| 2021,5
It was clean and the staff were nice and professional. For 1 night stay it was all i needed,Mar 28| 2021,5
I will keep this property in mind| good location and a clean comfortable room.  The staff was very friendly and professional| all normal for this brand.,Mar 28| 2021,4
Me and my wife made a weekend getaway in the rooms with a RIVER VIEW. We stayed on the 44th floor and I must say it’s the best time we have ever had in a hotel so far. The waterfront was perfect and we only had to walk two blocks to enjoy. Everyone was also very courteous when we arrived as well as many people on staff if there is any need for extra supplies as towels |tissues|etc. Bonus the lobby is really nice and I was able to grab and go with the free breakfast.,Mar 26| 2021,5
Nice quiet hotel in FiDi. Construction made it difficult to find a place to park just to check in  but overall a solid option if you’re in the downtown area.,Mar 25| 2021,5
Great location.  Near multiple subway stops/lines. Room and building were clean. Felt very safe. Very friendly staff.,Mar 24| 2021,5
Didn’t like it at all room to small in when I checked in my room walls dirty in in bed sheets wasn’t clean that good I want stay there no more.,Mar 22| 2021,1
Front desk staff were overwhelmed. Seemed understaffed. Our room was not ready at 10pm when we checked in. In compensation they gave one hour additional checkout time. Housekeeping seemed unaware. Elevators were slow. Website does not say parking is off-site. Floors were not cleaned despite sign on the room door that it room had been sanitized.,Mar 21| 2021,3
At first I walked into a room that was dirty and never was cleaned upon my arrival| but than when I went downstairs to front desk. The Representative helped me get a new room after I showed her the video of the room I was supposedly staying,Mar 21| 2021,4
Great place to stay| nice workers| perfect cleaning comfort bed |good prices,Mar 20| 2021,5
Great location|reasonable  price been here a few times.,Mar 19| 2021,5
Great midweek get away. Trip to Liberty Island| downtown sights. We will definetly book agin.,Mar 19| 2021,5
I loved it| so clean. You all were so nice,Mar 16| 2021,5
As frequent New York visitors| we have stayed in many hotels. This has by far been the worst. From the stains on our bedsheets to the paper thin walls and disruptive neighbors| we tried to be in the hotel as little as possible. The hotel itself feels old and outdated. The elevators take forever and are ancient. Every time we requested something from room service we were directed to a different extension and then redirected in circles until we gave up and found solutions ourselves. The other guests were incredibly disruptive and rude. Do not recommend and will not be returning. Does not enhance your New York experience| just causes stress.,Mar 15| 2021,1
It had such a warm clear feeling and everyone was so nice and helpful,Mar 9| 2021,5
Room was dirty. Staff were disinterested. Overall a disappointing stay,Mar 8| 2021,2
I feel like the hotel staff needs to address the loading and unloading situation in front of the hotel. Apparently| “no standing” means “no loading/unloading” in NYC. I was ticketed $115 while getting our family out of the 37th floor. It took about 3 trips up and down total plus the checkout. After the second trip down there was a ticket on my windshield. I had no idea what for at first| but after looking up the laws apparently the entire street in front of the hotel counts as a “no standing” zone and right across from the hotel there is ongoing construction. In addition to being an excessively high fine| I am truly not sure how - other than luck - to get in and out without risking the fine. The hotel staff barely seemed to be bothered or interested. Nor could they tell me what I could’ve done differently to avoid the fine. That’s kind of a big deal if people are going to pack into and out of your hotel.,Mar 8| 2021,3
Nothing. Expensive parking ! Small rooms and  I dropped my ear pod under the dresser was dirty like if no one cleaned for a year under there !,Mar 7| 2021,2
The front desk reps are rude| especially Anna. The floor in the room were dirty.  No hot water.  Must run the sink and shower for 10 minutes until it gets warm.  Was shocked that during my stay| all the front desk folks I spoke with aren't friendly.  Either upper management at the hotel treats their staff poorly and they pass that bad attitude onto guests.  After a long day of traveling| no guests needs to deal with their bad attitudes.,Mar 7| 2021,1
No hangers| no iron| no iron board| and no hair dryer. I had to wait over an hour to get them because the person that would get these items was on break and no one else had a key to get them.,Mar 6| 2021,1
I live in New York and come here to get away from reality with my boyfriend. The rooms are so cozy and comfortable. It’s exactly what I need for my peace and relaxation,Feb 28| 2021,5
I booked a king size room| arrived and they told me they no longer had a king size room. If I would have known they didn’t have a king size room| I would have stayed at a different hotel,Feb 28| 2021,1
Rooms are pretty small and bathroom are really congested.,Feb 26| 2021,2
They staff was very friendly and attentive| the room was all labeled and disinfected and all tidy,Feb 22| 2021,5
Great place. Great location. Felt very safe. Full of young kids though trying to party on weekends. Blasting music until 3am| until I finally called down.,Feb 21| 2021,4
This is an extremely reasonably priced hotel for NYC. The staff is always very friendly and the room clean. Best is that it is so close to the subway. Whenever we have an event in the city we stay here. It's a nice little get away.,Feb 20| 2021,4
I didn’t like how small the room was. Very cramp like. I could hear people in their room from my room. The halls felt like I was in the projects or a motel that was fitted as a shelter.  I had to go to several different floors for ice because there wasn’t any on the floor I was staying on.  There was no staff member at the desk where you go to buy water| so there was I guess a security guard trying to assist until someone showed up. The room was clean| though. The view from the room wasn’t so great.  Couldn’t connect to the WiFi.  I think it’s pricey for the stay there. I wouldn’t go back,Feb 15| 2021,2
Not horrible but not great. Room reservation was changed without notice. Thin walls. 3 crap elevators. Service was good just other things to work on.,Feb 15| 2021,3
They told us we needed ID for the card I was using for the security deposit. We had to leave and couldn’t find a cab. How can I get my money back???,Feb 12| 2021,1
Great property| decent size room| convenient location,Feb 10| 2021,5
Restrooms were not clean( See images for details)Room was extremely small. Floor wasn't clean.Adjacent rooms are not sound proofed adequately. Loud neighbors that left the TV on during the entire night.,Feb 8| 2021,2
It was a very clean and average hotel. Nothing too special expect the view the view was amazing from the 36th floor! I was surprised that our room did not come with a fridge and the room was smaller than I expected. Overall the cleanliness was top notch and the service was good.,Feb 8| 2021,4
It’s near my work. I stayed during the recent snowstorm.,Feb 7| 2021,4
Amazing experience! The hotel is spotless! The staff are beyond hospitable| and amenities are top notch! I was able to use the computers for printing services| the gym to workout| and snacks are always available in the lobby. And of course| Doubletrees famous cookies are still readily available. Thanks for a great stay!,Feb 6| 2021,5
Room is very nice and comfortable definitely enjoy the view and everything was perfect,Jan 30| 2021,5
The staff were excellent especially Brian and Gio  ... The housekeeping guy (shortie) and that Italian restaurant dude is excellent - very good food. I WILL BE BACK - I want my room 4003! Amenities were very clean!,Jan 26| 2021,5
Great location and price! The staff was to the point!,Jan 25| 2021,5
My room shared a wall with a couple that talked non-stop from 11pm to 8am| believe it or not. Walls are paper thin si heard their whole damn conversation... phone from the room wasn’t working to reach front desk. Since I booked through Expedia| the hotel was unable to refund me for the most horrible night I’ve spent at a hotel. I’ll definitely avoid staying here in the future.,Jan 23| 2021,1
What I didn't like was there wasn't any hotel attendance for clean towels after 5pm and they did not clean my room or attempt to give any towels or dump trash out the rooms and you have to go all the way to the lobby to dump trash this was not a pleasant stay and parking was horrible its a commercial area so you had to find garage parking for 75.00 a night. I would definitely not recommend this hotel or its location to anyone it's horrible,Jan 9| 2021,1
I had a horrible experience. The woman that checked me in was rude and not helpful. On top of that the hotel was huge and they put us in an adjoining room with 4 people that were loud and partying until 7am. The phone in the room wasn’t working. The bathroom was dirty. The room was small. They say “pets stay free” and then charged me $50.00!,Jan 8| 2021,2
Great hotel! I felt completely safe and that everything was really clean. All the staff we interacted with were really nice and friendly. It was walking distance to restaurants and all of the banking district sites.,Jan 5| 2021,5
I love the location. It gives easy access to the city.,Jan 5| 2021,4
Perfect location!!! Not in the middle of all the hustle and bustle but also not far from it!!,Jan 4| 2021,5
Bad service,Jan 3| 2021,1
It was clean| the staff were nice. The room view was amazing. Never disappointed by this hotel,Dec 29| 2020,5
The hotel is in a great location. Steps from the Wall Street bull and food spots. My only complaint was the size of the room. But I understand it’s New York. But it was extremely tight. For a quick stay I wouldn’t mind going back.,Dec 20| 2020,3
Check in was strange being on he 2nd floor as oppose to upon entry. Elevator was too small and the wait long for the elevator. Overall the hotel was clean.,Dec 18| 2020,4
The towels they gave me were dirty. Fresh towels that I went to the front desk to get was filthy.,Dec 15| 2020,2
The hotel was worm and cozy the cookies that were given to us was delicious,Dec 15| 2020,5
Terrible Service| had to go to reception to get soaps etc due to lack of room service. The area was noisy due to people talking in hallway.,Dec 13| 2020,2
Location of the hotel was very convenient you have everything next to you but because Covid everything close early but the most uncomfortable and awkward it was the room very very tiny we have two beds there was small there is no space at all for four people two adults and two small children  not enough space I was very disappointed I will never stay there again|front desk they very rude!!!!,Dec 8| 2020,4
Everything in New York is under construction at this time. But other than that the location is great and very convenient regarding local food and bars and walking distance to the train stations.,Dec 8| 2020,5
Overall for me it was a great experience and had a great time staying at the doubletree hotel i would strongly recommend anyone to stay there great view great location great people and all for a great price,Nov 24| 2020,5
Rooms are small but I enjoyed the shower. Bed sheets had stains and so dod the bed. No room service because of covid but thats to be expected. People in check in were nice though. Wouldnt give this place a 4/5 but maybe 3-3.5/5,Nov 22| 2020,4
The hotel was clean and close to all love the view. The room modern m clean bathroom tight but clean Only 1 roll of toilet paper and 1 soapThe fridge was a drawer in the table very small but uniqueThe view gorgeous but the light was tooo bright on the morning.. curtains didn’t help No housekeeping no breakfast items available only at front desk ... market and check in same attendant ... sooo had to wait 20 mins to buy a sandwich and juice,Nov 9| 2020,4
Very clean and very friendly staff. Because of a glitch timing with the visit of the Statue of Liberty an extension at checkout time was offered at no charge. Thank you. The breakfast to go it's decent and offer plenty choices. The fitness room it's closed but the view from 35 floor it's amazing. Room it's a little bit small but updated tv| furniture and beds. Overall a good affordable spot depending on your travelling plans. The parking its not included it's 45 bucks and it's close by the hotel which it's ok regarding how much it's the parking in the area. It's valet parking and in order to reach the car| if needed| you have to wait a while. Thank you!,Oct 20| 2020,5
Área is excellent just found a weird smell in room. I really couldn’t say what it was. It was overall a good stay.,Oct 19| 2020,4
Guest next door played loud rap music ALL night. As soon as the hotel staff left| the music was turned up again. Not enough backbone from hotel staff to enforce quiet time. The entire point of a hotel is to be able to spend the night in comfort. Unfortunately| that did not happen last time I stayed there. If you want to have a good rest| get a room that does not have direct access to another one.,Oct 18| 2020,3
Best hotel I’ve been to yet. The staff was amazing & always available. Free complementary upgrade to a city view as well as delicious cookies. The room was small but clean with an amazing shower. Close to restaurants & pharmacy.,Oct 12| 2020,5
We had several issues.Early check in wasn’t available when we arrived.They wouldn’t store our suitcase at 1st but the a sales manager got involved and placed it in his office while we spent the day in the city.When we returned around 3:45pm our room still wasn’t ready - at 4pm we were given keys to a room but when we arrived the keys didn’t work. I left my family in the hallway outside the room and went back down to have the keys remade. The 2nd set of keys didn’t work either. At this point my wife called down and about 12-15 minutes later someone came up to get us and move us to another room this one had a broken toilet. My wife took the kids down to the lobby to use the restroom while we waited for an engineer to fix the toilet. Once it was fixed we didn’t have any other issues with our stay.Grab and go breakfast was good.Beds were comfortable.Room was clean.,Oct 11| 2020,3
Great price| clean room and environment. Safe precautions in place.,Oct 9| 2020,5
Staffs were rude and inattentive during check-in. Bedsheets/pillow and comforter were dirty with stains. Kept calling front desk for new sets of bedding| which took them an hour to bring up to my room. Bathrooms were dirty. Construction is also happening in the lobby.,Sep 27| 2020,2
I guess it was under construction which sucked. Your location is horrible| no restaurants around far away from places we wanted to go. I will never stay with double tree again...,Sep 22| 2020,2
Everything was great| although the room was tiny.,Sep 21| 2020,5
The front desk was rude and unfriendly| unprofessional| I stayed for 3 days and not one time was I ever greeted with a hello! The place is under construction so its nothing like the pics!,Sep 19| 2020,3
Double Tree at 8 Stone St. No on-site parking| you have to go down a block to parking garage and pay $40 a night if you get your parking pass validated by hotel otherwise $70. They have a picture of a beautiful| roomy lobby| very misleading no roomy lobby as pic indicates| wait outside to check in. We got there the day after Labor Day| Tues Sept 8th and they were in the middle of remodeling the Check-in area| cardboard on the floors| foam board taped to the elevator walls| construction supplies visible. Room was nice| clean with 2 full size beds| very cramped for 3 people with luggage. Beds were comfortable if you're| small fridge for drinks| coffeemaker. Nice view of WTC One Tower and surrounding buildings. Nice location where you can walk to ferry for Liberty Island| WTC Memorial. Due to Covid-19 Pandemic all businesses were closed by 8pm. By Fri| wood flooring was in place in Check-in area and a small Kiosk for essentials- water| soda...etc was being put in. If only,Sep 19| 2020,3
It was great!,Sep 18| 2020,5
Upon arrival there were issues on the parking situation| I understand it was from an independent group but the waiting time| the lack of help was really disappointing. In addition| the room wasn’t really cleaned well and felt lacking to the normal doubletree Hilton standard. Also| pretty bummed about not having cookies here! Feeling like I spent way too much for lack of quality and care. I won’t be referring this location to anyone.,Sep 17| 2020,2
It was ok| even with construction| there were a lot of young adults for some reason. They need microwaves in the rooms| and the phone in the room need to be fixed.,Sep 16| 2020,4
Awesome view of the WTC. Convenient location. Shops/ cafes/ pier 17,Sep 14| 2020,5
The staff was amazing. The area is good location where we needed to be. I wish I knew the hotel was under construction before I signed up to book. I paid for breakfast every morning expecting a continental breakfast but due to Covid (which wasn’t mentioned in the booking) we got a paper bag of snacks I could’ve bought at the store that weren’t appetizing. The sheets were disgusting.,Sep 12| 2020,3
HORRIBLE HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!!This is NOT the hotel to stay in NY. Is under construction. Lack of staffs. Losing parts in our room bathroom. Our this speaker is damaged. To connect with operador from our room is like a challenge. The Lobby looks like a Metro Station to buy tickets.  Believe me. Terrible experience!,Sep 12| 2020,1
Great experience!! Love the king size bed!! Very clean and organised!!,Sep 11| 2020,5
I wasn't too pleased with my recent stay. The hotel is undergoing renovations currently so everything just looks extremely crazy. The room was okay. The bathroom sink had extremely hot water and no cold water to wash my hands. I wasn't able to get any fresh towels or rags due to COVID and was in need of new ones. Although I went to the front desk| I wasn't able to get any due to none being available at the time. The location was convenient as far as cute little restaurants and convenience stores along with the subways. Overall the stay was not that great. I feel like it would be better once they're done with renovations.,Sep 9| 2020,3
Great place to stay! So close to everything. My trip to NYC was great thanks to this hotel.,Sep 8| 2020,5
Terrible customer service relation and racist. Absence of social distance in the elevator. Elevator is about 3ftx3ft yet 5 people in inside at a time. No signage of social distance posted anywhere in the hotel. The worse| no parking space. You will pay extra $50 pee night for parking. No breakdast offerd with reservation. Very narrow hallway. The worst and most terrible hotel stay ever.,Sep 8| 2020,1
The first disappointment was when I booked the hotel there was an option to pay for the room alone| or book the option that includes a buffet breakfast. Traveling with 4 kids| I selected the rate that includes a buffet breakfast. I get to the hotel| and the women said there is no breakfast. Their only offering was a muffin| cup of fruit| and a juice. No sorry or anything. The second thing you notice is there is really no lobby. They are checking guest in through a booth| and you're pretty much waiting outside. There was alot of construction going on as well. Thirdly| the toilet stopped working in our room| and the front desk clerk moved us to another room. However| when we walked into the new room it was already occupied by other guest. Now me and our kids are downstairs in the outside lobby in our pajamas waiting for another room. The clerk at first couldn't find a room with two beds as they were supposedly all booked. So I'm like a hotel with 40 plus rooms. You don't have 1 room available with two beds to fit me and my kids. I was utterly disgusted with the hotel and staff. The staff acted so non-nonchalant as if they really don't care what you have to say| or what your concerns are. Long story| short| I would never stay at this hotel ever again! I visit NY alot| but this place would never be option any longer.,Sep 8| 2020,1
The room was very small and as well as the entry way,Sep 8| 2020,1
Room was great| staff was very nice and helpful. The hotel seems like it’s under construction. The whole front lobby was more of a construction site. A/C wasn’t working in the room and other guests aren’t respectful of social distancing. Overall the room was nice.,Sep 8| 2020,3
Mal servicio habitación llena de polvo no tenía aire acondicionado luego lo prendieron y se apagaba nunca funcionó bien no lo recomiendo esta en remodelación,Sep 7| 2020,1
Wouldn’t let me change dates of stay therefor I just lost my money,Sep 6| 2020,2
I understand it is quieter in the city because of COVID and this is why many hotels are renovating... but maybe make your guests aware of this so they can decide to go elsewhere. This whole place looked like a wreck. The lobby was completely shut down and I felt I was in a horror film. My husband and I were completely taken back not expecting to be walking in to a stripped down hotel| otherwise I would not have paid for this! It was also dangerous with workers on scaffolding right OUTSIDE the elevator for hours upon hours each day. They had to move the guys away from the elevators each time guests used them which had dangerous materials and equipment on the scaffolding right above your head. My husband and I would dread leaving or coming back to the room feeling like a nuisance being in the way of major construction (I have a photo displaying this). Very poor on Hilton's end for allowing this and not bringing it to people's attention before booking. Greatly dissappointed.,Sep 3| 2020,2
Beside the construction thats still going on in the building. I had to change rooms because the first room was dirty| the glass door for the shower was broke off and there was glass shards on the floor and there was light bulbs left sitting on the side of the sink. The second room i was given was clean but didnt have any of the toiletries and the phone in the room didnt work i had to go all the way down stairs to tell them and i was on the 38th floor,Aug 30| 2020,2
The property is still under renovation and construction....plus no tv guide nor a bottle water in the room...very disappointed,Aug 29| 2020,4
The toilet did not flush| missing toiletries| building undergoing construction/renovation  which should have been mentioned during booking. An overall bad experience that has soured me on Doubletree and will no longer recieve my business.,Aug 29| 2020,2
Bed sheets were dirty| no sheet under comforter that is used for every guest| fridge was broken in one of the rooms we had. The other fridge only fit 3 bottles ( normal size).  Most times no towels or wash cloths. Front desk lady’s always have a attitude. The building should be shut down right now honestly| they’re redoing everything and it looks bad. I went on a Monday paid for city view and supposedly “they were booked up in my room type in the best city view floors” when I went there| there were a handful of guests. Every other door was still taped shut. ALSO PARKING is $40 small car & it’s$45 each time you go to park! You can’t just go get your car go get something to eat and park again! You’ll have to pay!! & street parking is beyond ridiculous to find| my family and I almost checked out right away because it was so difficult!  Would not recommend.,Aug 28| 2020,2
I loved the water front view| the room was very clean| and also the perfect size for two people. (One king size bedroom) Just a heads up there is construction going on in the main lobby/elevators so the “front desk” does seem a little sketch. Also something I wish I knew before going| 3rd party parking! $40.00 a night! Plan accordingly.,Aug 27| 2020,3
Even though it seems the hotel was under some type of renovation or construction in the check in area| the lady at the front desk was very helpful & informative. Also my room was very clean & comfortable I had a great view of the twin tower.,Aug 23| 2020,5
I reserved this room for my sister because she had been driving 36 hours. I paid with my card. Everything was confirmed. When she got there she was told that she needed a card with $50 to get the room. That was not stated in any terms when booking. She was not able to get the room so she had to sleep in her car. Very upset. Would like my refund since my sister was never able to stay there per an employee at that location.,Aug 22| 2020,1
Overall pretty good| although a heads up over renovation would have been needed.,Aug 18| 2020,4
I really like this hotel. Comfy bed. Good service.  Pillows could be better. Too flat for my liking. Close to trains| ferry. There is a Chipotle and a walgreens at the end of the block and plenty if bars around. I would definitely stay here again,Aug 16| 2020,5
Good,Aug 12| 2020,5
The hotel is close to the River front and restaurants and I enjoyed the location a lot. The place is very clean and my hotel room view was pretty pleasing to me and the staff was great.,Aug 11| 2020,4
Not so good,Aug 10| 2020,3
It was clean. The A/C had artic mode and it was comfortable.,Jul 30| 2020,5
The hotel was under a renovation| elevators are the worst| the workers don’t respect social distancing and go into the elevator with the guests all the time.,Jul 29| 2020,4
It was awesome I enjoyed it,Jul 27| 2020,5
The location can’t be better. However| due to on going renovations everything is not in service.,Jul 26| 2020,3
No maid service. Room was dusty due to thr renovations.,Jul 17| 2020,3
It was okay no accommodations. It was okay towels and wash cloths they were cheap with. Shower issues WiFi is okay . No breakfast accommodations .,Jul 17| 2020,3
Room linen was dirty we requested another set of linen which wasn’t much cleaner. As well as rooms are tiny,Jul 14| 2020,3
Great location and great staff. Room was clean and great view,Jul 9| 2020,5
The place was ok but i had to buy my breakfast outside not even a bottle of water in the room the shower was so tiny .... ufff,Jul 5| 2020,3
This hotel is a very comfortable place to stay. The mattress| floor| bedding| walls| bathroom are very clean. I stood on the 38 floor in a king size bed and the view looking out into the water was beautiful! The N| W| R| 4| and 5 trains are up the block and right around the corner. The only thing I would change is they used a sheet for the based of the bed instead a fitted sheet. House keeping need to be better at putting a fitted sheet on the bed. I did not received their warm chocolate cookie.overall I would stay there again.,Jun 26| 2020,4
Room I reserved wasn’t available| Breakfast wasn’t available even though I purchased it with my room. this not a 4star it’s more like a 2 star I was very disappointed.,Jun 25| 2020,2
The hotel was doing renovations which we were aware of but my guest and I had problems with inhaling dust in the lobby and stair case. They put us on the very top floor which was the 44th floor. At the time of check out the elevator button wasn’t working so we contacted the front desk and he told us sorry we are doing maintenance on elevators right now. We had no time to waste being that our car was at a parking garage so after 20 mins of waiting we had no choose but to walk down 44 flights of steps and once we reached the front desk after inhaling desk from renovations on multiple floors the manager did nothing to compensate our stay. I will never stay again and anyone with asthma I DO NOT RECOMMEND staying at this hotel.,Jun 20| 2020,1
Our experience at the hotel was very good. We are planning on staying there again in a few weeks,Jun 15| 2020,5
Disgusting| blood on pillows| could be signs of bed bugs and all I received was an I’m sorry. Do better.,Jun 12| 2020,1
I am still waiting on my deposit refund which was supposed to come in 7-10 business days. Also| I was not expecting $100 deposit.,Jun 8| 2020,3
The property was clean and the rooms were immaculate,Jun 2| 2020,5
It was good,Jun 2| 2020,5
Elegant once you get to the seond floor and the nice view out the window,Apr 26| 2020,5
Didn’t look or feel clean. Reception was rude.Didn’t have extra pillow cases. We wanted to change ours cause they looked like they hadn’t been changed.,Apr 18| 2020,2
Horrible experience...first i paid for a river view room that has a king bed|then i got there they said the river view is not available because of wherever reason..then i go up to the room only to find a full size bed in a room without heat or hot water.Horrible,Apr 18| 2020,1
We enjoyed our stay! The hotel was very clean and in a good location! The staff was friendly!,Apr 15| 2020,5
There were bedbugs in the bed. My friend woke up with bite marks we checked the bed with a flash light and found bedbugs. Disgusting! I was told by one of the staff that they had a bedbug infestation weeks prior and the rooms were inspected| apparently that room wasn’t. I’m very disappointed!!. I have to bag all my belongings and pray that I don’t bring any home. They didn’t even offer a refund to clean our belongings. It’s disgusting!’ The worst experience ever.,Apr 7| 2020,1
Very loud construction or banging noises next door in the early morning.,Mar 22| 2020,2
There was mold in my shower and a broken outlet and the Sink was would take forever to drain.,Mar 17| 2020,2
Bed way too soft felt like I was drowning no fridge in room no vending machines,Mar 16| 2020,2
The hotel room was comfortable and quite. The rooms were clean and appointed nicely.,Mar 16| 2020,4
The hotel was under construction and was in total disarray. Elevator was not clean and had tape and cardboard on the floor. Hallway to the room was extremely narrow| room was the tiniest room ever. Had construction happening directly upstairs with banging and floor replacement super early in the morning. One of the worst hotel experiences. 2”would like to request a refund.,Mar 16| 2020,1
Beautiful View of downtown!  Beds are comfy! Room is clean!,Mar 15| 2020,5
I loved the service and the redesigned rooms. Beds were comfortable and room service was great!,Mar 13| 2020,5
Staff was very friendly. I booked it thinking that breakfast was included. When I did the search for the hotel I selected "breakfast included" in the filters so I was disappointed when I realized that it was not.,Mar 11| 2020,4
Over all very nice....only issue is often took for forever to catch elevator to go up or down.,Mar 9| 2020,4
No parking and no free breakfast. I have paid around $500 without free food.,Mar 5| 2020,2
Insanely huge flat screen tv with free premium movie channels. Partial view of the river. Lots of space in the room. Free cookies and bottled water at check in. Wifi works great. Conveniently located for the WTC memorial. Very good access to transport links| including light rail to Hoboken and Brooklyn is just over the bridge. Would stay again.,Mar 1| 2020,5
All good| only complain is that there are only 3 elevators for 44 floors and that makes going up and down complicated.,Feb 26| 2020,4
Fast check in| clean rooms| friendly staff| great price.,Feb 25| 2020,5
Good location in very lower Manhattan. Nice staff. Comfortable bed. Small room| but nice. There was construction going on while there| so| since they sometimes used one of the elevators| that and the already overtaxed 3 elevators for 44 floors| frequently made for long waits.,Feb 25| 2020,4
3 elevators that were never in service at the same time. One specifically that service was using. Majority of the time the elevators were being taken up by service people going a few levels up or moving carts. Desk staff ignorant| unhelpful and pricks,Feb 17| 2020,2
The location and staff are great overall| it's not in the middle of any nightlife other than the 2-3 bars nearby and some of the staff was surly BUT the big problem here is that elevator. Don't let any review or staff member tell you it isn't a problem..because it is every day. I just visited dead of winter and we were waiting for 20-30 mins every morning to be able to get an elevator. We were 9 floors up and a few times we were forced to walk down the stairs. Every 5-7 minutes we would get an elevator stopping on our floor filled to the brim. The issues were NOT just in the morning this happened at 3pm and 5pm as well. It ruined a few of our plans and I wont be staying there again. Double Tree failed me.,Feb 17| 2020,2
Everything was good but it was cold in the building. We adjusted the heat in the room and that worked fine but the halls and elevators were cold,Feb 13| 2020,5
The property was nice but small and felt a bit dated.  The staff was wonderful and helpful.  The only issue we had was that the elevators were very slow and with the height of that building| it was inconvenient.,Feb 12| 2020,4
Good location for me. Not enough elevators. Very clean,Feb 12| 2020,4
Customer service was excellent. Great location steps away from the subway and near main attractions.,Feb 11| 2020,5
Great property! Wonderful staff! Hotel was very clean.,Feb 11| 2020,5
Great location; pillows were way too mushy; and mattress was very squishy,Feb 10| 2020,4
No bar or lounge in hotel. No refrigerator in rooms. No continental breakfast.,Feb 7| 2020,4
the rooms are very clean. i was kinda disappointed that the room did not come with a tub.,Feb 6| 2020,5
Beds comfy| location to food excellent| many choices to chill and have a drink. Subway very close. Room was cozy. Bathroom a little small-shower hot. Could have been cleaned better small mold in shower. Bed super comfy. Tv Great quality and lots of channels. Other reviews had slow elevator we did not encounter that problem. Staff was super friendly.,Feb 4| 2020,4
Great location super clean great breakfast good value,Jan 31| 2020,5
We had a king suite.  Room was small.  Loud hallways and room temperature very hard to control.  Front desk folks super nice.,Jan 21| 2020,3
Easy check-in and great staff. I would definitely stay again.,Jan 21| 2020,5
Great location and staff. The room was never really cleaned well| but other than that| it was great.,Jan 19| 2020,4
Stayed here numerous times. It has an excellent location| has very clean and comfortable accommodations with courteous staff. Only downside are the extremely slow elevators.,Jan 12| 2020,4
Perfect for a weekend foodie trip. wow! So happy with the hotel location and free breakfast was amazing!!!!,Jan 11| 2020,5
Nice hotel. Well located   Would recommend and would return,Jan 11| 2020,4
shower is not good....water drop all over. i reserved include breakfast but invoice do not show that,Jan 11| 2020,1
We loved our stay. Check-in took maybe 5 mins and we were given delicious warm cookies which I thought was awesome. Some of the furniture in our room was a bit worn| but it was very clean| generally quiet the two nights we were there| and overall just a great stay. It's super close (maybe a block and half) to a couple subway lines| there is a Duane Reade on the corner. I'd definitely stay again.,Jan 6| 2020,4
Elevators were always broken.  Needs to be cleaned. Staff was very friendly and helpful though.,Jan 6| 2020,3
We enjoyed our stay! The hotel was nothing spectacular| but good enough for a weekend trip while we were exploring the city.,Jan 6| 2020,4
We were on the 20th floor and using the elevator was a bit of a pain. There was a morning where we waited over 15 minutes and the elevator still didnt come. We decided to take the stairs at the end of it all. Otherwise| had a really good experience. Great hotel.,Jan 5| 2020,4
Came home with bites on arms and legs - think there’s bugs here,Jan 4| 2020,3
There was a hole in the wall. Cracks in the bathroom sink. Dust everywhere. Random paint splotches on the furniture. No conditioner in the bathroom. The bed was not the size we paid for. Nice reception lady.,Jan 3| 2020,3
The property’s elevators were horrible due in part to the flow of traffic. There are only 3 elevators to accommodate 44 floors of people. If everyone is checking in and checking out at the same time you’re going to experience a significant bottleneck. Maybe think about managing the elevators better.,Jan 2| 2020,3
The property is in a good location. The staff are friendly courteous. And check in was a breeze. Over all a great experience so far. The rooms are very small but modern and updated. The only downside was due to the small size of the room there were no work desk to setup and work from my laptop,Jan 2| 2020,5
Horrible! Had a death in my family| made a hotel reservation and had to cancel. The hotel was booked| and even with my reason they would not give me my money back. But even better... they told me if i cancelled I would be charged for ANOTHER night. Great service!,Dec 31| 2019,1
Great staff always warm and embracing. The washroom conditions in my suite were atrocious. The toilet dripped all night long. After showering| I felt like I was standing in a mud puddle because the drainage was blocked. Same situation with the sink. I suppose the friendly service of their staff makes up for the poor facility.,Dec 30| 2019,3
Hotel is in the perfect location for subway access| statue| Brooklyn Bridge| Wall Street and World Trade. The room is perfect. Beds are comfortable. Only down side was the elevators. They were extremely slow but that is to be expected due to time of year.,Dec 26| 2019,4
Very clean and made check in and out super easy. The entry way is small| but they were very helpful when we needed to know where to navigate ourselves in the city as well.,Dec 23| 2019,5
Rooms were clean| breakfast was good and subway was across the street,Dec 22| 2019,5
Excellent location and service.  Food was exceptional.,Dec 18| 2019,5
The housekeeping staff uses the guest elevator| which holds you up for hours| very inconvenient. Its strange they do not use or have a service elevator for back of house employees. I work in the hotel industry and never seen anything like it. Called in room dining 4 times to send a menu that was not in the room.,Dec 16| 2019,3
Nice place| very central.,Dec 16| 2019,5
Property great in every possible way- EXCEPT the elevators. We had an audition to get to and thankfully we planned accordingly for elevator issue around busy time... waited 45 minutes because it was check in time,Dec 15| 2019,4
There were only 2 elevators and very small. 43 story building took forever and most of the time full so you couldn't get on. room wasn't ready at check in time. room small| no storage space.,Dec 14| 2019,2
Good size room for NYC. Nice big bathroom. Very clean.Elevators could take some time so we usually took the stairs since we were on a low floor.,Dec 12| 2019,4
This was a great hotel for our weekend visit to NYC. It was a bit away from what we wanted to do but the close train stations made traveling a lot easier. It was also in a quieter area which was nice. The room was very clean and every staff member that we interacted with was very kind and helpful. The bed that we got was incredibly comfortable and made it difficult to want to get up in the morning. Overall| we would stay here again! It was priced fairly compared to other hotels near it. The only things that were less than satisfactory were how slow and small the elevators were and there was no microwave or mini fridge. I know the rooms were small but they definitely could've fit them. With over 40 floors| the 3 elevators took forever when you called them. It was very awkward when it stopped on other floors to pick other people up but there wasn't enough room for them to get on. They could only fit about 5 people comfortably without any luggage or bags.,Dec 10| 2019,5
I booked this hotel for an employee for business travel. Upon a late arrival at 10pm at the hotel| he was informed that the hotel had actually overbooked rooms and did not have accommodations for him. Instead| he was sent to another hotel of poorer quality. We did not pay a cheap price tag for this room. I've tried getting in touch with both the hotel and hotels.com about the trouble but have yet to hear an answer-back. I did not even know that such service was even possible from a Hilton hotel. Be aware when booking here| at least through hotels.com. I'm always confident booking through the service for the "Guaranteed Room" promise...but this was far from the case.,Dec 9| 2019,1
Staff service great and place was well cleaned and organized  Subway station up front of hotel and many good places walking distance.  Great location,Dec 9| 2019,5
Our stay was awful - the thermostat was broken and kept changing the heat| the bed was so small and old we kept rolling into the middle and we were put in a disabled room where the shower head sprayed everywhere and was broken. Would never stay here again.,Dec 5| 2019,1
Everything was great,Dec 2| 2019,5
Price paid should include breakfast.Not enough lifts for a hotel of this size.  Long waits for lift.,Dec 2| 2019,4
I was quite happy with the hotel itself but it was the first time I was staying at a noisy hotel. I could clearly hear what people saying in the next room and there was an ice machine close to my room which kept dropping ice every once in a while so when I came back after a long day| exhausted| I couldn’t really sleep well.,Dec 2| 2019,3
Very nice! In the past I’ve only stayed in Midtown| but I’d definitely choose this hotel again. It’s a 20 min train ride from Times Square but it was nice to get away from the chaos. Very accommodating- arranged adjoining rooms for me and a family member| gave great recommendations on nearby restaurants. I found others’ comments about slow elevators to be false. We never had a problem.,Nov 29| 2019,5
Need new mattress,Nov 28| 2019,1
Good location. Excellent staff. A tiny bit dated/ in need of refresh but overall good.,Nov 28| 2019,4
The only time I rode the elevator was upon arrival.    You had to wait approx 20-25 mnutes to get on the elevator.  When the door would open on our floor| the elevator would be completely full(to top that off one of those times it was full of the house/room cleaners).  We were on the 35th floor.  And used the stairs 95% of our stay.  It was a horrible choice.  Travelocity bill when made res was 198.00.  When i was billed at end of stay it was $250.  You need to be very clear that additional charges could be added(taxes or whatever) upon arrival.  Felt like I was totally mislead.  That was the worst stay I've ever had at any Hilton property.  And I've stayed in a lot of them.,Nov 27| 2019,1
The rooms are pretty small but hey it’s New York. Besides that it was a pretty nice stay.,Nov 17| 2019,5
It was a goog hotel to stay in New York finicial district| easy to get around the city and to enjoy New York,Nov 12| 2019,4
I love the hotel| the rooms the lobby the staff were amazing. My only Negative is the elevators were a bit slow at times and overworked for the size of the hotel. It was obvious that they weren’t all running at the same time. I would’ve preferred some fresh fruit to be available in your little lobby store and the gluten free cookies. Otherwise I love this place and I’ll very likely stay again.,Nov 12| 2019,5
Nice hotel.  The rooms are small and the elevators are slow at rush hour.  It is an NYC hotel so I guess that is to be expected.,Nov 1| 2019,4
Lovely| friendly and helpful staff. Major drawback is that there are only 3 elevators serving about 44 floors and seemingly no dedicated service elevator either. Wait times to get to and from our room were high.,Oct 29| 2019,4
we received an exceptional welcome from staff| and they let us check in early because room was available which was great. the staff was very nice and helpful. thanks,Oct 28| 2019,4
44 floors with 3 elevators. Had to wait 25 min for elevator,Oct 28| 2019,3
Excellent service. Staff was attentive and courteous. Would highly recommend this hotel.,Oct 28| 2019,5
in down town wall street area lots of bars snd Restaurants around,Oct 27| 2019,3
Have stayed here numerous time! Perfect location| great courteous staff| and accommodations!,Oct 27| 2019,5
The location was great| since it was a new area for me to explore.  However| upon check-in| the staff person said I hadn't paid for my room and had to charge me until I could prove it was paid.  I booked through Travelocity so it was prepaid.  So I printed out the email as soon as my meeting was over| and they proceeded to void the 2nd charge.  It was just a hassle.  I have to say that their front desk staff are some of the friendliest hotel people in NY| but just didn't care for the add'l headache.,Oct 22| 2019,3
Well located. There are few elevators for so many floors.,Oct 20| 2019,4
This was not a four star hotel. This was a two star hotel at best. Our first room was dirty and had significant damage throughout the suite. The shower floor was cracked - we thought we would cut our feet when showering| the shower also had no guard in the door so water would leak all over the bathroom when the shower was turned on. The floor was clearly not vacuumed and there was significant damage to the walls throughout the suite. The air conditioner/ heating unit was so incredibly loud that we were not able to sleep through the rattling noise it made when turned on. We asked to be moved and were moved to an equally dirty and damaged suite. I needed to use the hairdryer in the suite| it was badly damaged| sticky| and appeared as if it would cause an electrical fire if plugged in| so I called front desk to ask for a replacement. After 30 minutes| we called back again and the reply was “we will send it right up.” Needless to say| it never arrived. Throughout our stay a clasp to close the window fell off as it was hanging on by a thread and came off in my husband’s hand as he opened the window. The towel rack also fell off as it was placed on top of the brackets it was supposed to be screwed into. Throughout our stay the elevators would cause a wait upwards of 30 minutes| not in peak traffic time. One guest explained to us that it took her over 1 hour to take the elevator to the lobby to check out.,Oct 16| 2019,1
Good hotel in a great location. The one drawback are their elevators| with 3 elevators servicing both customers and staff across 40 floors you have to plan for lots of wait time| particularly during peak hours.,Oct 14| 2019,4
Hotel was relatively clean| aside from the room service tray with leftover food that was left sitting in the hallway for days. Rooms are EXTREMELY small| much smaller than other nyc hotels I’ve stayed in. Elevator situation is just unacceptable. We had to walk down the stairs and carry our luggage down with us. There was a bridal party staying in the 32nd floor that had to walk down and up the stairs. I won’t be staying here again.,Oct 14| 2019,2
Only stayed for one night so I didn't see much else of the property other than the lobby and my room. One thing to note and this goes to Doubletree as a whole.... please bake chocolate chip cookies with no nuts. There are entirely too many people with nut allergies now for Doubletree to bake cookies with nuts. The gluten free cookies are ok| but they're not the warm classic cookies Doubletree is known for.,Oct 13| 2019,4
It's much than what we thought. Room and bathroom are small but manageable. Clerk from the counter was very nice and helpful. Reception locates at 2nd floor. Elevators are kind of busy but waiting time is not too bad. This is really location walking distance to many hot spots.,Oct 13| 2019,4
Waited a while for my room but got free breakfasts as compensation.  Otherwise everything was excellent.  Would definitely consider coming back.,Oct 7| 2019,5
Megawatts should we get together with the boys today to come to our party on Friday night if I have a,Sep 26| 2019,3
Dingy little street very slow elevators. Try to get a lower floor| or never get the elevator at 8am.,Sep 26| 2019,5
This hotel was quite nice. The location is great. Subway stops within a one minute walk.   Close to great restaurants. Staff was friendly and very helpful. Quiet room even during the day.,Sep 24| 2019,5
It’s a great location in lower Manhattan. However| there is always a very long wait elevators. Also we stayed there two nights and our room was not cleaned.,Sep 23| 2019,3
The room was very clean and comfortable. Bed was comfortable and bedding was very nice. The bathroom was very nice and clean as well. The only problem we encountered was the delay on the elevator. They had 3 elevators but only two of them were really working.  The staff also used the same elevators so it took longer to get to our room and down to the street.  We stay on foor 18 and unfortunately the person I traveled with has a walking disability so taking the stairs was not an option for us.  Other than that the hotel is a great location easy access to the metro and other shops.  Great walking distance to see the fireworks (our visit was during the 4th of July). The hotel is also environmentally friendly by saving energy.  Lights| ac ect only work when key hard is inserted. They also participate in water conservation efforts by giving guest the option to reuse their towels and not replacing the linen daily. Great experience and would definitely recommend to others.,Sep 23| 2019,5
Although I've visited New York many times| I've always lodged in New Jersey.  This was my first time staying in the city and I was very surprised.  Everything was so small and compact.  It took a day or so to get use to the "smallness".  However| everything ended up being okay.,Sep 22| 2019,4
Great location and a good price.  Clean| and the staff was very nice,Sep 18| 2019,4
The staff was very accommodating and the room was cozy and super clean!,Sep 15| 2019,5
Location. Staff. Facilities. Cleanliness. Gym. Tech.,Sep 11| 2019,4
It is well located for sightseeing. The lifts can take along time to come because the staff use them to go between floors instead of using the stairs. The hotel take a $350 deposit on check in and it does not get returned until 3-5 working days after check out. When you think there are 44 floors and 10 rooms per floor the hotel is making a great deal of money from this practice.,Sep 10| 2019,3
The location great | close to many attractions Housekeeping horrible | they don’t clean well,Sep 6| 2019,2
We came here for a two night stay during Labor Day weekend. Everything was great for our stay. The room (1 King Bed - City View) was not big| but it was bigger than what I expected considering the amount of rooms and size of the hotel. This was my first time staying in Lower Manhattan and I really enjoyed it. It's very quiet at night. My main concern about this hotel was the elevator situation after reading all of the negative reviews about it. Elevator problems ended up being a non-issue for us. There are only three elevators| which I can understand is a problem to some people. Our room was on the 37th floor (hotel has 44 total floors) and the longest we waited for an elevator during our entire stay was about 4 minutes. Other than that| we essentially were in an elevator less than a minute after pressing the button. They also move extremely fast from floor to floor| which was a surprise to me because I read reviews about them being slow. It was a holiday weekend so I figured it would take a while to get in the elevators| but again it was not a problem for us. Either we got lucky or we're very easy to please. The stay overall was great and the hotel was quiet. One thing to note: from our city view room on floor 37| we had a view directly at the World Trade Center| but it was a bit obstructed by other buildings. So don't expect the best view.,Sep 4| 2019,5
It was a great location to the subway and shops however for 4 days I had flies coming out of the plug. And each day the handyman came to put down poison. The bed sheets weren’t changed and the towels smelled horrible. I demanded to be moved to another room I couldn’t take the flies anymore. The breakfast was not appealing I would give it 0 it was burnet. The staff are friendly and attentive.,Sep 3| 2019,1
Location was nice ! Other than that overall Hotel was ok quality. The room they gave us was very small & shower was horrible. Very small shower space it almost made for children only.  Also very small elevators & very narrow hall ways. We will not stay there in the future !!,Sep 3| 2019,2
Staffs were very unfriendly. Very noisy and lots of construction going on in the area. You should avoid it at all costs,Sep 3| 2019,2
The only thing great was the location. Rooms are tiny. No fridge or microwave. The front desk was friendly but never followed through with requests. There are only three small elevators in a building with forty something floors. Trying to leave or go to the room was always a challenge becuase how busy it was. The rooms were clean but they are outdated. The water was aleays really hot and you dont know whcih way is cold or hot. Then after we showered the pipes would make a loud noise. The hotel rooms look really nice online but that is not how it is at all.,Sep 3| 2019,2
The staff were very friendly and the hotel was clean. The elevators were very slow and small. There were sometimes lines to get on from the lobby so that is the biggest problem with this hotel.,Sep 3| 2019,4
I booked this hotel last minute for a business trip.  Check in went smoothly| I unpacked| and then headed out for a meeting.  I got back late after dinner and got ready to call it a night.  When I got into the bed| the left hand side of the bed was wet.  Not wet from an air conditioner venting| or a drip from the ceiling.  It was wet under the comforter| but not on top of it.  I called and requested a new room| which I was given.  When I followed up the next day to see if anything else would be done I was told that my complaint was logged as a faulty air conditioner the night before.  I recapped what the actual problem was and haven't heard anything since.,Sep 2| 2019,2
Got wrong room. With only a twin bed. They have a sign to make it right for you in the room.  That is anlie,Sep 1| 2019,1
Staff are really nice! But the room is a little bit out dated.  Also| my 17month was climbing on the nightstand| I didn’t realize it wasn’t secured to the headboard| so it fell on her and she has a scratch on her face.,Aug 31| 2019,4
Clean| updated. Friendly staff. Great location. Good price,Aug 29| 2019,5
Centrally located| subway station within walking distance,Aug 27| 2019,4
Perfect location| place| comfortable!  Very easy access to subways| dining| lower Manhattan.,Aug 26| 2019,5
There was no refrigerator in the room. You have to rent one at extra cost. What kind of Mickey Mouse organization is this?,Aug 26| 2019,2
Very nice property! Great location. Rooms a little smaller than usual but its NYC! Id stay again,Aug 25| 2019,4
Nice location for business in the financial district. My only real beef was on the slowness of the elevators and lack of A/C (no A/C in the elevator shafts at all) although i definitely did not find the staff particularly hospitable.,Aug 23| 2019,4
Elevator situation was ridiculous. Long waits| very small| many times the door would open and the can was full. And the checkin being on the wedond floor was very inconvenient.,Aug 22| 2019,1
Great place|great location. Super view from our room,Aug 22| 2019,5
Great location and staff.  Nice clean rooms.  Only downside is there are only three elevators so it sometimes takes a while to get to your room and/or to the exit.,Aug 19| 2019,4
Decent location to the financial district area| the room was filthy. Dirty Q-tips on the bathroom floor| empty shooters under the bed| broken electrical socket covers. I mentioned the lack of cleanliness upon check out and was just given an “ehh| I’ll tell hospitality”.,Aug 19| 2019,2
Older hotel ... nice rooms with all the amenities you expect. You pay for what you get in this part of town. Friendly staff| no late checkout.,Aug 16| 2019,3
Pros: great location| close to subways| NYSE| Battery Park and Statten Island Ferry. Good WiFi. Reasonably quiet. Good AC. Comfortable beds. Cons: terrible elevator service| always at least a 10 min wait. Things a little on the dingy side. Early check in request not accommodated,Aug 13| 2019,4
Nothing | this hotel is 44 floors| has 3 small elevators| you have to wait good time waiting for the elevator. Room is small no microwave | no refrigerator. Floor Carpt old and humid,Aug 12| 2019,3
Start| watch out with parking is not like any others with unlimited in and outs| lobbies is on second floor and with only 3 elevators (slow) good luck going anywhere| if you need to get out by 8 step in front of the elevator at 7| the rooms are sooo small that you can not even stay at you room one day|| bathroom you better be standard size person otherwise if you have a little more weight!!!!!! Air conditioning is the ones you set on windows so you have a better chance in a motel 8 or 6 or somewhere else to sleep without noise is terrible| if you need to be at this area leave this property at the very last on you list,Aug 12| 2019,1
The front desk gets busy and is understaffed. It is also not located on the first floor| which confuses many when checking in and out of the hotel. Please add more signs on the bottom floor of the building. Once you get settled in| things are nice until you need service and have to wait an hour to talk with the receptionist again.,Aug 11| 2019,4
I liked that it was very clean and it was in a great location. I didnt like that there was no refrigerator in the room.,Aug 6| 2019,4
The location| was the best. But the hotel is very uncomfortable and the service is poor,Aug 6| 2019,1
Hotel is centrally located at the NY Financial District.  Close to restaurants and transportation.,Aug 5| 2019,5
Great location near subways.  Close to Statue of Liberty| bull and stock exchange. Amazing views from the rooms (freedom tower). Lacking amenities such as bathtub or fridge/microwave but makes up for it with location.  Elevator wait times can be frustrating during peak hours.  Quiet hotel| very nice staff.,Aug 4| 2019,5
great location but noisy;  air conditioning was not working properly started heating instead of cooling,Aug 4| 2019,4
Just ok. Elevator issues during checkout. Very inconvenient walking 39 flight of stairs with luggage,Aug 2| 2019,3
I liked that it was close to subway and attractions.  I did not like that the elevators took for ever .  They elevators where small| hot and slow.,Jul 30| 2019,3
It took 45 min(not exaggerating)to get an elevator from the 41st floor when checking out at 10:30 am.If i didn't have my suitcase|  i would have walked downstairs,Jul 30| 2019,3
I liked how fast it was to check-in. I did not like that it took me 15 minutes to wait for the elevator to take me to the 15th floor! The elevators were terrible.,Jul 29| 2019,3
Overall the room was clean and exactly what we needed. It was in a good location and we felt very safe in the neighbor hood. Only complaint is that we found some of the staff to be a bit rude. We tried to engage in friendly conversation waiting for the elevators and neither looked up from Instagram on their phones to even acknowledge us.,Jul 27| 2019,4
The staff are friendly and VERY helpful! But this is the poorest property for wheelchair access i have EVER seen. It took me 10 minutes  to get to the second floor just to check in. And then every time after that I spent no less in 10 to 15 minutes waiting on an elevator. The elevators are extremely small| and are not accommodating for wheelchairs if there is more than four people in the elevator already. Our last day took me 45 minutes to finally get an elevator to the ground floor to leave.,Jul 25| 2019,1
Property was very conveniently located by a subway station and a few restaurants. Room was very nice and clean. Perfect for a quick getaway in NYC!,Jul 24| 2019,5
This is my third time staying there! I love staying here first because it’s quiet as I’ve stayed in TS and it’s so busy! This property is also the cleanest place I have stayed at in nyc! And I love the cookie!,Jul 23| 2019,5
Rooms were very clean and updated. Check-in was a little odd however as you had to go up to the 2nd floor to check in.,Jul 22| 2019,4
The customer service staffs were great. The bel hop and front desk were very friendly and helpful. They were able to accommodate an early check in for me ( LIFE SAVER| THANKS DANA!) . As for the room| it needs some updating. I thought our tv would fall off the wall at an given time. The AC unit would not stop leaking| so our carpet floor was soaked around that area. There was no air ventilation in the hallways nor the elevators. Nothing like a pack elevator during checkout hours with a baby and no AC| stopping at every floor.,Jul 22| 2019,3
This property is well suited for a business or get away weekend. If you are staying longer| another property may be better. The elevator wait times were terrible. The staff here was GREAT! Everyone was friendly and helpful!,Jul 22| 2019,3
Location.I did like the location for this hotel you got restaurants coffe shops close .Walk for about 10 minutest to Battery park where you just get on the boat to go see the statue of liberty.....The building is fine the only issue was the elevator too slow......The AC in the room it was working fine|but I adjust the Thermostat and stopped working....the beds Not that great you sanked in it......,Jul 21| 2019,4
Its in a nice location..walking distance to everything,Jul 18| 2019,4
Good area| close to most of the attraction we wanted to see and use.,Jul 16| 2019,4
Everything was perfect| just expect to wait for the elevators every time you need them.,Jul 16| 2019,5
Very accessible to the city.The views were fantastic the staff was very friendly. Plus cookies when checking in,Jul 15| 2019,5
I understand the compact nature of the hotel and recognize that with a smaller footprint per unit the style of the accommodations would have to be different from what yo normally get in a Double Tree. However that doesn't excuse:1. Little room to put out amenities in the washroom.2. The shelf that is provided is small and not set perpendicular to the wall - as a result objects slide (fall off the shelf)3. An air - conditioner system that believes 71 degrees is a setting to reflect polar room temperatures and that setting it a 72 degrees is a signal to initiate heating the room4. A shower door that leaks like sieve - step out of the shower into a mini pool - this was reported to staff and essential no remedy provided.5. Finally - the water was turned off at mid-night on the first night - no warning - and when the desk was called - no explanation other that work was in progress. Given that the water was off - occupants should have been told to run the water the next morning to ensure any settling or dislodging of material in the system was removed.Negatives aside - the hotel is well situated from a tourist perspective. It is unfortunate that basic accommodations tends to downgrade what should be an excellent hotel located in an exceptional spot.,Jul 14| 2019,2
This hotel is fine except for one thing: the elevators are super slow. Sometimes it was a ten minute wait. I took the stairs whenever I could| but not everyone can run up 20 floors with a suitcase.,Jul 13| 2019,3
Located in the Financial District| this hotel is conveniently located in close proximity to many subway lines.  Unfortunately the cleaning staff is sub-par| and the facility is in a state of disrepair.  Long lines at elevators that break down.  One night our room had no running water| meaning no sink| shower or toilet.  I called the front desk who said they would send an engineer.  Half an hour goes by and no engineer.  I call the front desk again and a different person says this is the first they've heard of the problem and they will look into it and call me right back.  No call back.  Half an hour later the water comes back on| but it's brown and has black specks in it.  Light fixture in the shower is dangling from the ceiling.  Breakfast buffet is mediocre at best.  If you want a glass of water or juice you will have to search for waitstaff.,Jul 11| 2019,3
Every single person who worked in this location was EXTRAORDINARLY kind and nice to me!  You bellhops were especially memorable and WONDERFUL!!!  Please find some way to commend them all for being such exceptional ambassadors of your hotel.  I truly enjoyed my stay as was consistently pleasantly surprised over and over by how nice I was treated and that your bellhops seemed to go above and beyond to make certain that I was well taken care of| and I WAS!  Many thanks to all of the hard workers in this location!!!,Jul 9| 2019,5
The location of this hotel is excellent. Just steps away from the subway at Whitehall-Stone St.| Battert Park| restaurants| etc. The checkin and checkout were quick. The only complaint I have is that there's only 3 elevators for a 40  story building| 10 rooms per floor. They can get very congested and you may spend more than 15min to finally get your chance to take the elevator. Overall| I liked this hotel and I would stay there again.,Jul 8| 2019,5
I wouldn’t say there was anything unique. I just admired the hotel.,Jul 8| 2019,4
Cons:Noticed stain on bedsheet upon check-in. They were quick to change but it was disappointing to see such things from a 4 star hotel. 40 floors and 2 elevators. Takes forever waiting for one.Parking is not within the same building. It is just a block away| but will be good if they tell it prior for self parking so that there is no confusion upon arrival. Once parked| you will not be able to access it until you checkout.Pros:Great LocationPrompt serviceWalking distance to almost everythingPharmacy is also in the same block,Jul 7| 2019,3
The hotel was clean and the beds were comfortable. The access to WiFi was a plus and also to the computers downstairs since I needed to print a few things. One other plus was the food offered on the menu for breakfast was really good. The downside was definitely the hallways which were small and the elevators. They did not have enough for the amount of floors they offered; they were slow and there was always a long wait anywhere between 7-15 minutes. The wait for the elevator was at all hours of the day and night so that was a HUGE inconvenience. Additionally| they didn’t have an elevator for staff so often times| additional time was needed to allow for them to use the elevators and with their equipment| it took up a lot of space; not to mention the elevators were SUPER small. If you are on a lower level| don’t have large bags to carry| and don’t mind taking the stairs up or down| this hotel could absolutely work for you.,Jul 7| 2019,3
Elevator was broken. Employees said owners were aware and didn’t care,Jul 5| 2019,1
The air condition is Bad,Jul 5| 2019,4
Left a tee shirt in the closet. Staff was unwilling to look for it.,Jul 5| 2019,4
Cozy clean room| friendly staff| great value. "Quiet" part of Manhattan. Will consider staying here again and highly recommended,Jul 4| 2019,5
neat king bed room  and nice view few building /world trade center too. nice lobby .,Jul 2| 2019,4
Nice place| nice employees but the bathroom left a lot to be desired. Not enough room to change your mind! No room to store personal items while taking a shower! :),Jul 2| 2019,4
It may seem unfair to compare this hotel to others in the doubletree brand but I am. I’ve stayed at several doubletrees and this was by far the worst. I picked my stay based on my experiences at the other brand hotels. The service was terrible. The in-room orders for breakfast (by hanging the order in your door) were cancelled but no one explained that to us until we called about the missing breakfast. Late night staff was rude and unhelpful to inquiries about available supplies in the pantry area. And the elevator service is by far the worst I’ve ever experienced. Waited nearly 20 minutes for an elevator that wasn’t packed or “out of service” because staff was using it. Best part of the stay was the location.,Jul 2| 2019,2
The only thing I did not like was the fact that each floor only had one double room and it is located directly across from the elevator.  Otherwise| it was a clean| comfortable property with a friendly| helpful staff.,Jul 1| 2019,4
This hotel is not great. Elevators are slow and the door struggled to open a couple of times| which incited panic. There's also no AC in the elevators or hallways| which| during an NYC summer| is disgusting. The in-room ACs leaked and didn't seem to reliably work| despite what we set the thermostat to. Rooms and common areas are small and cramped. It's expensive and the area isn't great. We did appreciate the friendly staff and ease of text message check out| however| I'd never come back.,Jul 1| 2019,1
The television was not working in the room. At check out no credit was given for this issue.,Jul 1| 2019,1
View was great. We had booked a king bed but were given a queen bed.,Jun 25| 2019,4
Great staff. Easy to get to. Close to the subways.,Jun 25| 2019,5
Walked away with bedbug bites and having to spray luggage with alcohol and do an extensive cleanse of all belongings as a result. I put in a formal complaint and they said they hadn’t received other complaints.,Jun 24| 2019,1
The room was clean and quiet and right in the heart of the financial district. The staff were friendly| but old room service plates from our neighbour sat outside of their room in the hallway for a day before they were cleaned.,Jun 24| 2019,4
The register desk was excellent but to get to the room was horrible.  We had to take the stairs to the front desk and after we register we had to wait about 10 to 15 minutes for an elevator.  While waiting we were sitting.  After we checked out one of your elevator ( I’m thinking the middle ones) was hot.  Everyone on the elevator was hot.  Expect a call from some unhappy parents with children in that elevator. Things happen bc I stayed in double tree before without complaints .,Jun 22| 2019,5
Cookies! The people were great as well! The location was convenient!,Jun 21| 2019,5
Very professional service| accomodating. Bed was comfortable| room was okay| could have been cleaner and roomier and it didn’t have a fridge or microwave. Lots of bars around that area which I wasn’t expecting. Close to the bay| World Trade Center| seaport district.,Jun 18| 2019,5
The room and bathroom was very small and compact.  Not enough room to stretch out.  One of my lights over the bed didnt work.  Part of ceiling was coming down in the bathroom.  42 in flat screen was great and the cookies.,Jun 18| 2019,2
My boyfriend and I loved our stay at the DoubleTree! We had a standard room with a king and it was beautiful| clean| and pretty quiet! It was also in a great location; close to subway stations and various attractions. Overall we had a great stay and would love to come back.,Jun 17| 2019,5
The bed was comfortable and the place was clean. Also loved the complimentary cookies. The water in our room was hot and hot without a cooler option until running the shower and faucet for awhile. Otherwise no problems.,Jun 17| 2019,4
Excellent staff. Our room was not ready at 5 pm but they contacted us when it was ready.,Jun 17| 2019,4
City view in financial district was pleading to look at.,Jun 15| 2019,4
Bed was so comfortable- property overall was a bit run down,Jun 10| 2019,4
Staff was helpful and accommodating. They were very welcoming. As an Honors member| they made me feel extra special.,Jun 10| 2019,5
The air conditioner made too much noise otherwise it was great,Jun 10| 2019,5
It was great| just you need to be potion with elevators.,Jun 7| 2019,4
The location was fantastic. However| I could hear doors slamming at all hours of the night and a full blown conversation in the room next to me (at 1am). The walls are paper thin and that was a little frustrating.,Jun 7| 2019,3
Lacked some basic room amenities. Didn’t have a fridge or microwave. Lacked an ironing board. The bathroom was very small.,Jun 5| 2019,1
Good location for Financial District.  Slow elevators...,Jun 3| 2019,4
Great room and location. The elevators are really| really slow. Especially on the weekends. The hotel has 3 elevators and doesn't have a service elevator. So the staff is monopolizing the system from 9am to about 5pm.On Sunday just around checkout time people were losing their minds.At that time we were on the fortieth floor and it took a half hour to reach the bottom floor. Only three elevators stopped in that time. The first 2 were totally packed and the third we barely squeezed on. On the way down we stopped at almost every other floor. Passing piles of angry people on every floor.It's sad because everything else is is pretty great.,Jun 3| 2019,4
booked a room for 4 people| only 3 towels| 3 cups| 3 everything| but it was clean and they let us book in early| so big thumbs up for that alone| happy.,Jun 3| 2019,4
The location was great. It is the only good quality of the hotel. The room was very small. The bed was awful and very uncomfortable. It was supposed to be a king but it absolutely was not. Ice machines are only available on certain floors and the first three I tried were not working. The elevators are hard to get and take forever going up and down. Ive stayed at many Doubletree/Hilton properties and this one was by far the worst.,Jun 2| 2019,2
Great location! It was about two blocks from the Whitefall Ave station. We were in manhattan in less than 20 minutes. The Staff was also extremely helpful. We were in the city celebrating my girlfriends birthday and I called ahead to order champagne for our room and a cheese plate. She loved it. Great Customer Service!,Jun 2| 2019,5
Great location| close to subway station| walkable to 911 memorial park and battery park.,Jun 1| 2019,4
Clean| comfortable hotel. Easy check in. Great Location: Two blocks from the Dead Rabbit and the 1train.,May 31| 2019,4
Great location to get around the tourist places.  Elevator wait was a bit long.,May 29| 2019,5
Room was ok. Rather than a city view I got a building view. Hair on bathroom floor and on toilet. Requested extra towels but never got them. Staff was friendly though,May 28| 2019,4
good location to see Statue of Liberty| easy access to subway to other major attractions.,May 28| 2019,4
Comfy and clean,May 27| 2019,5
Just an ok property. There was water issues when i arrived so it was frustrating but it was all resolved by morning. The room was very nice| the rest not at par with same brand,May 26| 2019,4
Great| but too few elevators.....long waits at times and compete with the maids,May 20| 2019,5
Very friendly and helpful staff! Close to everything I needed. I look forward to booking this hotel again. :),May 20| 2019,5
Difficult to access on a day when there were road closures due to a local festival.  We had to park far away.  Only 2 elevators for 40 client floors led to long elevator waits.  Breakfast not included.  Room was very nice.  Bathroom tiny but functional.  It was fine but I probably would not stay again.  I know if a nearby hotel that is cheaper and includes breakfast.  I was expecting more from a Hilton.,May 20| 2019,4
Check in was ridiclously slow and rude| elevators were terrible--one wait was almost 1/2 hour,May 20| 2019,1
This is NY so of course we didn't spend much time at the hotel.  We just needed a nice quiet place to sleep each night and we got it here. Will definitely stay here again.,May 19| 2019,4
Didn’t like the time waiting for the elevator.  We had a city view| not much of a view.  Staff was great!!  Room was clean.,May 18| 2019,4
Good hotel. Good location. Financial district| Manhattan.,May 17| 2019,4
Hotel is currently renovating. Good location in the Financial District of Manhattan.,May 17| 2019,4
Stayed for two nights| great amenities and even better staff!,May 14| 2019,5
The elevator is slow| to get to the 2nd floor where the front desk is to check in| also the entrance gets busy and crowded. Its the city so space is limited.,May 13| 2019,3
Ya good need to wait for lift on peak hours will be the draw back,May 11| 2019,4
Overall facility and service was great| but the elevator was too slow to facilitate during busy times.,May 10| 2019,4
This was my 2nd year staying at this hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Hopton was very nice and very knowledgeable about the city. The only issue that I have with the hotel was that the elevator is very slow and take way too long . Other than that good stay.,May 8| 2019,4
Perfect location for participating in the Five Boros Ride. Our city-view room had gorgeous view.,May 7| 2019,5
Me gustó la atención del personal y está bien ubicado porque está cerca de metro y un lugar muy tranquilo.,May 6| 2019,5
Comfortable overnight stay close to various points of interest with lots of restaurants nearby.,May 5| 2019,4
My wife and I were celebrating her birthday in NYC and stayed at the hotel for 2 nights. The room was very clean and the bed was comfy. We especially appreciated the fact that they allowed us to leave our baggage prior to checking in and after we checked out so that we could further explore NYC which was very generous. We can’t wait to plan our next trip and highly recommend this hotel.,Apr 30| 2019,5
Hotel and staff were great. great quiet location too with close proximity to subway lines. Elevators were a bit slow.,Apr 30| 2019,4
Very nice and relaxing was pretty clean and comfortable bed I love the double tree,Apr 29| 2019,5
Easy access to transportation. Tourists attractions. Not loud at night.,Apr 29| 2019,5
good service but the breakfast inside hotel is crazy expensive,Apr 29| 2019,4
Elevators extremely slow and broke once| rooms not too soundproof,Apr 28| 2019,2
The elevator situation is a joke.  I was talking with a few people that stay there regularly and they warned me it could take upwards of 30 minutes in the morning to get an elevator down to the lobby...I thought they were joking....they were not.  RIDICULOUS!!Ice Machines - why are there not ice machines on every floor?  That is a basic amenity....,Apr 26| 2019,3
Location and cleanliness. Elevators were HORRIBLY slow,Apr 26| 2019,5
From the check in - to check out - Great experience. The cookies were warm| and delicious (don’t let the other miserable reviewers fool u.)Room was clean and updated| staff was great. Great view - will definitely recommend and revisit.,Apr 26| 2019,5
Great location. Good service by the staff. Hotel needs an update - small rooms are crowded for 2 people.,Apr 24| 2019,4
Good location. Very slow| inefficient check-in. Some rooms weren't ready over an hour after check-in time.,Apr 22| 2019,3
Checking in was difficult at best and as others have warned the elevator situation is ridiculously slow. Our room only had scorchingly hot water NO COLD and they never fixed it or moved us. Showering was PAINFUL.,Apr 22| 2019,3
good:busy hotel| good location| convenient spotbad: poor receptionist attitude| lazy staff| slowest elevators ever.,Apr 22| 2019,3
Perfect downtown location| very clean| fantastic view of the Freedom tower.,Apr 21| 2019,5
we had to change the room at 1am because regrettable condition of the bathroom and wc,Apr 21| 2019,1
I liked everything except that I paid extra for a “river view|” and room 3208 did not have a river view.  I didn’t have time to change rooms because I had obligations in the city that I couldn’t be late for| and I didn’t expect the room to not have the view I paid for.,Apr 20| 2019,5
Check in was disappointing Room not ready Elevator always crowded People very friendly,Apr 18| 2019,4
Bed sheets were not cleaned and exchanged during my stay.,Apr 16| 2019,3
For a 4 Star Hotel I had better experience with other hotels. Overall| it was great service & clean & would recommend if you are planning any activities in the area.,Apr 15| 2019,4
Waited for a long time to finally get in the room| had to wait for another 20 minutes or so because the room that we were supposed to be in had bad ODOUR according to staff| family with small children should be the priority. Elevator was super busy you have to wait for 10/15min before you get to hop in one because staff/cleaners used it at the same time as guests| people that weren’t able to get in the elevator from the lower floor had to use the stairs to go down to the lobby because of this situation| with their luggage! Staff should have their own service elevator! Menu for the dine in was a bit confusing because when we called for service the staff advise that they didn’t have the kids meal which they had on the menu| and so you really have no choice but to order for their regular meals for your kids and of course get charge more!,Apr 15| 2019,2
Great location. Close to many attractions. Helpful staff,Apr 15| 2019,5
Rude check in never again so upsetting and frustrating,Apr 14| 2019,1
As this is a New York Property| you need to expect the rooms will be small. They are however very clean and comfortable with great bedding and bathroom facilities. The hotel is in a great location with so much to do around the area and close to the subway.We unfortunately had some very negative concerns. Check in. We arrived early and understood that we wouldn't be able to check in until the correct time| but we thought we could at least ask. We were greeted by a very terse check-in attendant named Venetta who was extremely rude to us. Practically yelling to us "That check in is not until 2pm." We kindly asked if there was a  possibility to see if she could check.  Again we were yelled at again by her "Can't you see that Im very stressed out here! You need to wait and see when the manager arrives!" We asked if she could give us an indication as to when the manager might arrive. "I don't know!" She yelled| "Maybe in an hour - maybe in two hours?"  We sadly backed away and took our bags to the bell desk to be looked after while we went and found some breakfast. After this| we went back to see if this manager had turned up. He was there and we asked if we could check in early and he made everything look so easy. He found us all rooms that were available and checked us in early. We had other issues with the hot water - there's not enough space in this section so I will write about it in the next.,Apr 11| 2019,3
Everything was nice and in great shape but it all seemed compact.   Not much space in the bathroom| and the elevators seemed to take forever.   Excellent value for the price though.,Apr 10| 2019,3
no webcasting on the tv. Need better technology to setup the entertainment system.,Apr 10| 2019,4
From 2am to 5am there was a domestic violence disturbance involving hotel guests| hotel staff and NYPD. Doubletree promised to refund me the room cost due to the disturbance but have not done so.,Apr 8| 2019,2
Great visit. Front desk staff was welcoming and helpful with even the smallest question.,Apr 8| 2019,5
Lack of elevators| waiting time to get up 35 floors was excessive. Couldn’t get into our room. Had to wait for electrician to open our room and then wait while he had to go get new batteries for lock. Wait for new key cards. Bathroom hadn’t been cleaned. Dry urine on toilet seat. Floor was dirty. Mirror was dirty. Sink was dirty. Disappointing for sure given the cost of room. Support staff were all kind and hard working.,Apr 7| 2019,2
It’s a clean small room in a greatbarea of town. Easy to get on the subway to midtown and uptown| etc.,Apr 7| 2019,5
Elevators were really slow. Ended up having to walk all the way down from 38th floor.,Apr 1| 2019,4
Nice location near subway and restaraunts....elevators a little slow,Apr 1| 2019,5
Fantastic location| friendly service| and warm cookies upon check-in.,Mar 31| 2019,5
It was a nice stay ! Only thing is we was burning up with the heat on even when we was turning the air on| still was a li,Mar 29| 2019,4
Room too small and housekeeping knocked on my door even though I had the DO NOT DISTURB sign out side of door and it was not yet check out time so annoying it’s like saying hurry up and get out not going back,Mar 28| 2019,3
Easy access to subway and close to everything. Loved the baked cookies!,Mar 27| 2019,5
Location was great. The staff was very helpful. We checked in with no problem. Housekeeping took way too long to clean our rooms.,Mar 26| 2019,5
The room I was in had a leaking tub and the thermostat was broken.,Mar 26| 2019,3
Checked in at 1am -- was greeted at the desk just as professionally as if I checked in during the daytime hours.  They provided hot cookies.  The linens were crisp and clean.  Didn't hear a peep from any other rooms.,Mar 25| 2019,5
Great solid. friendly staff. Pleasant stay. Lots of nearby good eats.,Mar 25| 2019,4
The only true complain I have is about the wait there was for the elevator. With our room on the 43rd floor it sometimes took about 10 minutes to get an Elevator to/from our room.,Mar 23| 2019,4
I waited for over 30mins. to be assigned a room that I made a reservation| even though a staff did not say sorry. The most terrible thing was that I called the hotel front desk to ask for fixing water leaks| but no one shew up. I should hear the sound all night...,Mar 23| 2019,3
It was in a great location| access to everything but did not like shower with no bath tub| water ran everywhere.,Mar 22| 2019,4
Great location and wonderful staff. The only issue faced was waiting time for the elevators.,Mar 22| 2019,4
Poor facilities - no hot water tgrough out entire staySpoke with reception been told manager will get back to me via hotel phone but NEVER did .. Very dissapointing Bed sheet never been changed ( dirt still on bedsheet | rubbish been left on side table  ) Poor management and poor cleaniness Would not recommend,Mar 21| 2019,2
We had a great stay at the Double Tree! Cookies definitely are a good reason to stay there. Hotel is in a good location you can walk to battery park| one world trade| 9-11 museum| Wall. St. We ate at Georgio’s pizza on Beaver St. twice very affordable. Subway is also close by. Pharmacy is close to buy water| soda| and snacks. Starbucks Coffee is also close to get moving in the morning. I would recommend this hotel.,Mar 20| 2019,4
Overall it was a good experience but the only down fall was that there was no hot water and no accommodations for the mishap. I understand things happen so I would stay there again but there needs to be accommodations made for mishaps that has nothing to do with guess. That is something we all need is a hot shower.,Mar 19| 2019,3
The hotel is under construction| but check in was handled well. There was no hot water one night going into the morning still no hot water at checkout. The hotel was able to give full refund of the stay without asking. They offered it for the inconvenience. It was extremely disappointing to have our stay and celebration of birthdays ruined but the management handled it eventually.,Mar 18| 2019,3
Every one was very helpful and nice. Facilities were very clean and up to date. My only complaint was the shower was tiny and hard to fit into. .,Mar 18| 2019,5
The hotel seemed nice and well organized. We stayed over St. Patrick's Day above the busy bar street| Stone Street| but did not hear anything from the street below. We also had a beautiful view of the river.I would be amiss not to mention that we did not have any hot water for the entire duration of the stay| so we did not get to shower (the water was freezing). However| the Front Desk was very receptive to our complaint and refunded our stay.,Mar 18| 2019,3
Had a great time. The hotel was very clean. If you are looking to party this is NOT the area. Close train so you can get around.,Mar 11| 2019,4
Staff is great. Everyone I came in contact with was very welcoming and willing to help. The only thing is parking can get expensive| but it's New York!,Mar 11| 2019,5
Location was good for trip. Room was a lot smaller than expected. Construction all around building. Room was quite. Tv channels very limited,Mar 10| 2019,4
This was not up to the Hilton DoubleTree brand. The heating unit sounded like it was powered by asthmatic rats| and the plumbing in the bathroom sounded like a fire alarm going off starting around 6am. I barely slept that night and won't be going back. Room #4410| if they want to check for themselves.,Mar 7| 2019,1
Very glad that I can check in earlier instead of having to wait until 4pm. Good staff and excellent room.,Mar 2| 2019,5
great location| nice staff| great service. will defintly come back,Mar 2| 2019,5
Great location| good for a short trip to NYC. The price was great and at the same price tag I possibly may come back again.,Feb 25| 2019,4
They gave us a free upgrade to a room with two beds.,Feb 25| 2019,5
One of the best places in Manhattan.  People were great| clean and good place to stay.  Convenient location.,Feb 24| 2019,5
Location of the hotel was great. Convenient to a lot of attractions and subways. However| the noise was too loud. You can hear every sound from the hallway esp. closing of the doors in the middle of the night. Elevators are always crowded. Wait times are long esp at peak hours. Check out was also a disaster. Small registration area. To top it off| the cleaning lady knocked mamy times in the early morning asking if we are checking out or not.,Feb 19| 2019,2
Comfort was neutral bc no hot shower first day.   But| thank you for correcting it for the next morning.,Feb 14| 2019,4
i love everything about this property just amazing ...all employees was just great and was a pleasant to meentthem they gave me a pleasurable greeting with a special cookie,Feb 13| 2019,5
my first stay here and I was only here overnight.  I would only suggest that it is more clearly labeled that you have to go to the 2nd floor for the front desk.  It was nice a gentleman was there letting folks know but if he wasn't there I would have been lost.  In fact as I was leaving I noticed folks standing there wondering what to do. I advised them they had to select the 2nd floor.,Jan 31| 2019,5
the toilet kept making this weird noise. that a asd asd,Jan 31| 2019,3
Friendly and hospitable front desk service and greeter.,Jan 29| 2019,5
Great location! Arrived in JFK in the early morning| and then took the subway to the hotel. Once I got off the subway| we were literally right by the Charging Bull| and about a 3 minute walk to the hotel. Once we got into the hotel| we were greeted immediately and offered to store our luggage. We were then told to proceed to the 2nd floor so that we could let the front desk know about our arrival| since it was too early to check in. Front desk was polite and quick. We were told that I would receive a text from the hotel when the room is ready| and we might not have to wait for the 3pm check in. I got a text from the hotel around 1pm| which was great because we were so tired! I really liked that they allowed us to  get our room earlier.,Jan 23| 2019,4
The front desk |doormen and employees were awesome on our next trip back to New York I would definitely stay there,Jan 22| 2019,5
There was no hot water we could not take a shower  for all week end in NYC!! Terrible.They should have let us know so we could have change hotel.,Jan 14| 2019,1
Room service menu is kept at the front desk. It was also  difficult to reach someone on the phone,Jan 7| 2019,3
Nina| our check in person was so wonderful!  Tolld her that ny daughter and biyfriend were going to get engaged that evening and she went out of her way to make it a great experience. We will go back!,Jan 6| 2019,5
was not offerd cookie at check in and my room smelled like a bottle of perfume spilled. The oder was overwhelming.,Jan 6| 2019,3
Room was great| but the elevators at this hotel are appalling. Average wait time for an elevator during busier periods is 5-10 minutes| and they were all working!,Jan 4| 2019,2
The bathroom wasn’t great. The shower was super hot and didn’t stay when you turned it down.,Jan 4| 2019,4
Nice room and view.  Good location to catch ferry or a bite to eat,Jan 3| 2019,5
Overpriced for the quality| lots of noise and small. Elevators take forever and we had to take the stairs,Dec 29| 2018,2
It took 15 mins each way.,Dec 29| 2018,3
The sink faucet was loose and the bathroom door was heavy| even when sliding it closed| there was still a crack through which you could see into the bathroom.,Dec 28| 2018,4
Cleanliness and quiet. Staff was also very attentive.,Dec 26| 2018,5
First experience was better| but I’ll return.,Dec 25| 2018,4
This hotel was amazing! Perfect location near multiple subway stations. Right near Battery Park| WTC and The Statue of Liberty. The room was perfect and clean. We stayed on the 41st floor and had an amazing view. Warm cookies upon check-in and check-out and the hotel even has a cab that they called to take us to the airport. Everyone there was friendly and helpful my entire stay. Will definitely stay here every time I visit New York!,Dec 24| 2018,5
Everything was great| minus the elevator wait times.,Dec 24| 2018,4
I've stayed here before because my son lives across the street.  Water was pouring through the bathroom vent and ceiling lights (obviously a big problem above the bathroom.  I had to argue to be moved.  They wanted me to wait for an engineer...it was 10 pm| and we had to be somewhere else.  This wasn't a little leak.  I was moved| but the front desk people were not friendly at all...to me or anyone else for that matter.  I can't stand that the lobby is on the 2nd floor and there is always a very long line for the elevators.  I stay here for convenience only.  I lived in NYC and am used to rudeness| but come on...if you don't like people| don't work in a service industry!,Dec 23| 2018,3
Room is small without necessary items| like water and a fridge. No slippers,Dec 21| 2018,3
I only stayed one night| but the room was well appointed and the bed was comfortable. My only complaint is that the elevators were small and extremely slow| so it they always over-crowded.,Dec 20| 2018,4
Amazing!! Great location| very quiet area| and excellent service!,Dec 19| 2018,5
The elevators were the worst part about the property. Also| I find it very frustrating that they sell to you in the lobby.,Dec 18| 2018,3
The room was very tiny difficult to move around for a couple| no restaurant near bye| very expensive and far from the city. I really made a poor choice with the hotel. the pictures of the hotel looks great in the computer but| actually when you see and stay |its not that great for that prize. never again | very dissapointed,Dec 18| 2018,3
Location is everything. Great spot for the price| lots of exclusive places.,Dec 17| 2018,5
Consider the elevators when planning your commute time.  There are 3 and 42 floors.  Great restaurants next door and across the street and super close subway access.,Dec 15| 2018,5
Old building| slow elevators| low value for money. Look for alternatives,Dec 12| 2018,3
The room was very small and hard to move around. Also the ac and heater was hard to get at an appropriate temperature on 72 it was freezing and at 73 it was extremely hot and stuffy also the shower water would go from warm to extremely hot duinrg the shower on its own. The location was great in the city and everything was clean room needs some tweaks,Dec 11| 2018,3
Elevators were very slow but the location is wonderful,Dec 11| 2018,4
Would be perfect if the rooms were a little bigger,Dec 9| 2018,4
The location was great. But| the elevator was so slow that I missed My lyft. The wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling and the towels were not that white and they were very scratchy,Dec 8| 2018,2
The hotel itself was very clean and a great location. Rooms were small but that was to be expected in NYC. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Downside: the room was so hot no matter what temperature we set the thermostat at and there was no exhaust system in the bathroom. However| I would return and stay there again if in NYC.,Dec 5| 2018,4
I Liked everything about this hotel| the staff was great and the place was great. It has a great Italian restaurant on the ground floor and a cool bar next door.,Dec 5| 2018,5
Good location with nice rooms. Didn't spend much time at the hotel so can't comment on amenities,Dec 4| 2018,4
nice comfortable  room / near many sight seeing places my grandsonand I wanted to see for the first time,Nov 30| 2018,5
Obstructed view but still great!,Nov 30| 2018,5
Lovely hotel| very welcoming and accommodating staff. Good location with many restaurants and shops nearby. Only downfall is the lifts| you can be waiting for some time.,Nov 26| 2018,4
The hotel was everything you would expect from a Double Tree. The staff is what made our experience great. We did not realize that the lobby was on the second floor. We were helped multiple times by different employees. The fitness room was great and had everything we needed. The only thing this hotel lacks is more elevators. Ask to be placed in a lower level because elevators take a while to come down from the higher levels. Again| every staff member we met from the staff behind the lobby desk| the maintenance people| and the luggage person on the first floor were all lovely.,Nov 26| 2018,5
Staff was so friendly. Close to everything. I have no complaints. Its a great location to start New York  City travels.,Nov 21| 2018,5
It was fine. Nothing special that i can recall. The shower curtain bellowed out a bit too much.,Nov 21| 2018,4
The elevators| which are necessary due to the size of the hotel| are so slow. The rooms are tiny| the Halls are not clean. You will pay a lot to stay here and the accommodations with not match. Despite paying almost $300 for a night| the cleaning staff did not change the linens on our bed. We had blood stained sheets| which we continued to have for the rest of the trip even though the cleaning staff entered our room each day. Disgusting.,Nov 18| 2018,3
The bed was very small and heating was difficult to use as it came on regardless of setting.,Nov 14| 2018,4
Always a pleasure to stay here.  Terrific surroundings and excellent neighborhood.,Nov 13| 2018,5
Great location close to Wall Street| the Ferry| Charging Bull| subway and the 9/11 memorial. First time in New York so first time in a tiny room but enough space for a king bed and room to walk around.  Staff very helpful and polite.,Nov 7| 2018,4
Great location for that part of Manhattan. Not a bad hotel but its age is showing.,Nov 5| 2018,3
Nice location to subway| World Trade Center and Statue of Liberty. Near by restaurants were a good selection and the hotel was nicely accommodated as you would expect with a double tree. All staff were very friendly and helpful.,Nov 2| 2018,4
You never knew elevators could be a problem until you stay here. Rooms are good| staff tries to help. Big problem is the elevators. 3 for 44 floors. It really sucks waiting for an elevator. Happened at all the busy times. Was a mess.,Oct 29| 2018,1
Good location close to the subway and Financial District. Room was comfortable and clean. Elevators tended to get backed up and certain times of day| and the front desk staff can be distracted and slow| but otherwise it’s a good| mid-priced option.,Oct 29| 2018,4
Near the 911 Memorial. Very clean with friendly staff,Oct 28| 2018,5
Property was nice| not far from my daughter's dorm.,Oct 27| 2018,5
located in heart of financial district | 2 mins to subway.,Oct 26| 2018,4
I was really surprised that I was given a "disabled" room and in any moment during my reservation through Expedia this was specifically mentioned.  This should be clearly stated.   I am aware that there was a note about the bathroom having a special shower but that does not necessarily means to everyone that the entire room is special.  The bed was small.     I am really disappointed about this.,Oct 26| 2018,2
The staff were very friendly and accommodating. They even offered to hold our bags after checkout so that we could sightsee unencumbered until catching our flight home.,Oct 24| 2018,4
The heater didn’t work so it was cold,Oct 23| 2018,3
Stay was easy to check in and room was clean.  Always have an issue with the elevators.  They take forever.,Oct 23| 2018,5
Nice hotel| and a wonderful staff. Would stay there again.,Oct 23| 2018,5
Good for a business trip| nice and clean. Service was nice. Room was smaller than expected and elevators were inconvenient at times. Not so great if this were for a vacation.,Oct 22| 2018,4
stayed one night so we could do the Ellis Island tour| found the hotel very convenient and customer friendly. From The doormen to the front desk clerks|we found them very helpful! The only downfall I found was the fact they don’t have a refrigerator in the room. Other than that I found the hotel a nice place to stay,Oct 21| 2018,5
First time coming to NY ans as soon as i entered the hotel| the valet was the first point of contact.  Amazing welcome there and at the front desk| our check in was at 4pm and we reached around 1. The agent quickly check and offered us a free upgrade to a room that was already ready.  Rooms were great and spotless.  Definitely a 4 star property.  Will come back soon!,Oct 16| 2018,5
Great location for the price| great room - clean and a decent size.Cookies on arrival!Only criticism is that there are only 3 lifts so can spend time waiting for one. But would stay here again next time I’m in the city.,Oct 14| 2018,4
Perfect location to see a show at Pier 17 South Street Seaport. Food and drink walking distance.,Oct 14| 2018,5
Ordering room service was difficult. No one answered the phone. Would have liked more info in room about area and menu from hotel restaurant.I had to go to desk for answers but hotel staff was gracious and helpful. I would stay again.,Oct 13| 2018,4
Nice and quiet,Oct 12| 2018,5
Great location for business trips. The location had great restaurants and was easy to access all the main subway stops.,Oct 12| 2018,5
The location of the hotel is good. However| the staff - especially at the reception is terrible. Customer service = 0. Help = 0. Although there might be rooms already available| you have to be aware that the check-in time is at 04:00 pm. What are you doing if you arrive at 10:00 am....or earlier after you have been travelling from Europe...want to get a quick shower| get dressed because you have a lunch meeting  (Finance District). ! Do not expect to get help....Well| that's your problem !,Oct 12| 2018,1
Far too few elevators for the number of occupants - long waits and full elevators passing by.,Oct 11| 2018,2
Did not get to stay at this hotel. We were relocated the 4 nights we were in town. Tiffany the front Office Manager was friendly and helpful the 2nd day| when we stopped by the Hotel. Expedia had initially refunded us1 night|  according to the FOM we will be fully refunded| awaiting for refund receipt.,Oct 11| 2018,3
the hotel was in a great location.the only issue encountered was that we were unaware of the "instant hot" water feature in the shower which controlled the water temperature. Perhaps some info on that could be posted in the room!Brrr.!,Oct 3| 2018,4
Room was larger than we expected.  Very clean.  Great view in every high room.   Staff were exceptional.  Easy access to subway.   We would definately stay here again.,Oct 2| 2018,5
I enjoyed my stay at the hotel. Could have been perfect if the room came with a (small) fridge.,Oct 1| 2018,5
Dreadful hotel.  Rooms are small and bathroom is extremely small. NO storage in the bathroom and NO counter space.  The WiFi was terrible.  I was on the phone at least 4 times for a minimum of 25 minutes each time getting the connection reset.  I will NEVER stay at this hotel again!,Oct 1| 2018,1
Will never stay here again.  Entrance is hidden; walked past it 3 times!  Very unattractive entrance on ground floor.  3 elevators for a 40 story building.  Wait| wait| wait.  Small room with 2 double beds.  Bathroom clean but tiny.  No place to hang anything - no hooks except one on back of door.  No shelves in bathroom to place anything.  We were given two plastic cups in the main room.  That was it.  Toilet paper roll was so close to the toilet that it required some gymnastics to take tissue from the roll.  The shampoo container was the smallest I've ever seen in a hotel.  And| only one of them provided...for 3 people.  I am surprised that Hilton would put its name on this place.  Oh| and Wi-Fi was awful; connections dropped frequently.,Sep 30| 2018,2
Good hotel excellent location great price  excellent room,Sep 28| 2018,5
Construction across the street all night and loud pipes when nearby rooms started showing in the morning. Awful.,Sep 27| 2018,1
Room and staff were lovely| however the lack of elevators led to a lot of time waiting around and on the last day on only one elevator was in operation which made it nearly impossible to get a lift with the amount of people checking out that day,Sep 26| 2018,3
Upon arrival for a 2 night stay at this hotel with the narrow hallways and a small room|  the elevator had a sign indicating one of the 3 elevators was not working and a wait time of 15-20 minutes was usual. Being on the 27th floor| walking up or down was not an option. Several times we waited longer than 20 minutes to enter into the phone booth sized elevator. On the second night at 10 pm the room had still not been cleaned| bed not made and no fresh towels and coffee packs . Called down but they never came.The temperature in the room fluctuated from very cold to very hot every 5 minutes.The courteous front desk staff and the warm cookie upon arrival were the highlight of the stay for the over $300 per night experience.,Sep 25| 2018,2
Good service. Good location.  The only weak point is the Wi-Fi.  Appeared to be a bit on the slow side.,Sep 25| 2018,5
Good hotel with great location but all elevators not working. Sometimes wait time is 20 mins approx just for a single ride| which sucks,Sep 24| 2018,3
The room was very small and the elevator issue was annoying. We waited for 30minutes,Sep 24| 2018,1
Great hotel and location. All but one of the elevators| however| weren’t working. We had to walk up 20 stories after walking around the city all day. Not a huge deal| just annoying.,Sep 23| 2018,3
It’s a nice hotel. Very good location. At the time we arrived one of the 3 elevators was not working. The other two were insufficient for some reason. The elevators were simply not coming. Lots of people waiting for them. I carried my luggage up the small stairs up to the 6th floor where the room was. I was also staying with 2 kids. Not fun. Good exercise. Haha,Sep 23| 2018,4
Fire alarm rang for multiple hours at night| couldn’t get a good nights sleep at all,Sep 21| 2018,2
Room was fine second time round as there was no cold water in the first room. The lifts are slow and being on the 20th floor I had no choice in the matter. A 15 minute wait for one to arrive was quite normal during my stay.,Sep 21| 2018,2
I got charged an extra day for no reason. This caused my bank to overdraft. I have a $40 overdraft fee for a night I did not stay at the hotel.,Sep 19| 2018,3
Horrible! First of all| 40+ story hotel| 1/3 elevator was out of service (which was also the case when i stayed there 2 years ago)| though this time i was there for 3 nights and didn’t see 1 technician at all throughout my stay. Also| considering the fact most guests were using stairs when staying on a reasonable floor| they thought it was a good idea to paint the ramps at that same time. Then| plumbing was a real issue| as whenever someone on my floor (24th| which wasn’t a problem for my other family members staying on 6th and 7th) there was a terrible loud squealing sound. I slept with earplugs| but when i took my shower in morning| neighbour (who i assumed just checked in) came banging on my door complaing for noise as if it was my fault.To finish| on our last night| fire alarm went off at 2:25am| evacuating only people on 12-14th floor. Again| my family were staying on 6-7th so got woken up for nothing and just decided to leave because they were fed up.To top this off| i was the only guest in my room. I left my room and when i came back a while later| i couldn’t get into my room. The old school lock had mysteriously locked the door so I had to call front desk. The “ingeneer” said: “oh sh*t| thats going to take a while” and hung up.Keep it up Dounletree... (Place was sold recently| was way better before),Sep 19| 2018,1
Staff are awesome. It's the design that is bad. This property is in need of a renovation. The elevators just do not work. We had to walk up 17 stories on more than one occasion. When checking out| give yourself an extra 30 minutes to wait for the elevator with your bags.,Sep 18| 2018,3
Very close to subway to Brooklyn. One stop. Near cute area of historic bars and restaurants.,Sep 17| 2018,4
The wifi was bad and there was a fire alarm at 3 in the morning!,Sep 17| 2018,2
Rooms and lobby were clean. Size of rooms are small but that is common in NYC. One elevator was not working and it caused a wait of 15-20 minutes for an elevator| really frustrating. Other than that| our stay was fine.,Sep 17| 2018,3
Where to start? The elevator thats constantly out of service which means it takes ypu 20 minutes to get downstairs from your room. The false alarm fire alarm at 230am| then 20 minutes before receiving instructions to come downstairs for no good reason. Maybe if this was a real emergency we would have been in real trouble with the knowledge to handle such a situation properly.  Then of course having to wait a half hour for the elevator to get back up to my room with my 2-year old daughter which i had to wake up for no reason. Good luck getting her back to sleep at 3am.Explain to me how a hotel chain such as Hilton not have a crib on sit? Seriously showed up to the room in a pack n play for new borns.All in all one of the worst experiences ive ever had at a hotel.  Thank goodness it was only for 2 nights. Cant express how disapppinted i am in my experience. Knowing all of this| no one offered any kind of compensation for all the inconveniences. Cant recommend this hotel to anyone and i dont think i would ever stay at a hilton again.,Sep 17| 2018,1
A 44 story hotel with 1-2 working elevators is a challenge when anticipating your departure time from your room.,Sep 16| 2018,4
Bathroom small.  No WiFi whatsoever in my room.  Staff are kind| pleasant. Had I had WiFi (which the hotel said was available but wasn’t in my room) I would have rated a 4.  Hotel is in good location; was able to walk to the ferry for Statue of Liberty and to 9-11 memorial at twin towers.,Sep 15| 2018,3
If you have patience like a buddha and don't use the alarm function on your phone then this place is perfect!!! In the morning the water pipes and the beautifully LOUD melody they play from both sides of the walls will wake you up from around 7AM to 9AM. Also since the elevators were not working properly during my whole week stay| I ended up meditating in front of the elevator and or losing weight walking up the 23 floors. Almost lost even more weight walking up one evening by throwing up.,Sep 13| 2018,1
There are over 40 floors in this hotel with three small elevators servicing them. During our trip| there were two elevators in operation. There were long waits (sometimes as long as 30 minutes) for the elevators each time we went to use them| and I can't imagine things run more smoothly with all three operating. Still| the surrounding area is nice| and the staff were friendly.,Sep 12| 2018,3
The hotel was nice| my room was comfortable. The Staff was amazing!,Sep 11| 2018,4
I know some of this is just bad timing| but overall| it was quite frustrating.  There was one of three elevators out and wait times were up to 15-20 mins.  When on the upper floors 22-46 -- it was a challenge| we even had to walk.  When an elevator did come| it would be packed and what made it worse was half the people were housekeepers who were lugging around vacuums and supplies!!  Too add| the water was Scolding HOT.  We asked for them to fix it| but no resolution.  Showers were near impossible even on the coldest setting.  The pipes would hiss and screech when turned on and if a neighbor was using water| it would sound like that until it was turned off.  Overall| the hotel and area was nice| just some poor hotel issues.,Sep 10| 2018,1
First| it is a great location. Just where I wanted to be. There was a lot going on that was not good. One elevator was down. Wi-Fi was down. For the first two days I have no phone. Front desk tried to explain to me how| if I wanted my room cleaned I had to call. I tried to explain to them that in most hotels your room gets cleaned every day without calling. That seem to baffle them. On and off during my stay the only temperature for the water in the sink was warm no hot no cold. Apparently there was some pipe damage earlier in the week. Also there was a ringing noise often during the night coming I believe from the bathroom.  I could not determine where that was coming from or what it was from. Iwould actually stay there again because like I said the location is great and all of the things I mentioned did not really affect me as I was on a leisurely trip and a few crappy things happening in my hotel we’re just an annoyance,Sep 9| 2018,2
I think it’s odd how the lobby/reception is on the 2nd floor. During our five day stay| one of the elevators broke so we waited up to 5-10 for the elevator when there are 40+ floors. Our room was okay| the air conditioner was a bit filthy and the room’s decor was run down. The bed was fairly comfortable though! Towels are rough. We had a standing shower with a opening/closing door and for some reason| every time we showered| water would leak onto the floor! It was really annoying cleaning it up every day with towels. Also| we had a gigantic garbage fly in our room one of the nights we stayed so that was surprising being on the 30th floor. Otherwise| staff was extremely friendly but i wouldn’t stay here again!,Sep 9| 2018,3
the elevators were being repaired and I waited over 40 minutes in the hallway| which was not air conditioned repeatedly for 4 days.  It was a horrible experience.,Sep 8| 2018,1
They should’ve said in the description that there were repairs going on. The elevators took so long. Also| the rooms and hallways are small| cramped| you can clearly see they’re maximizing every inch of space. Two double-bed room should come with a mini-fridge| mine did not.,Sep 7| 2018,3
Unprofessional staff at checking.Unacceptable elevator wait. 1/3 elevator down.Very noisy room. Noisy a/c and noisy water pipes.,Sep 7| 2018,2
On the first night of my stay| there was a building-wide water outage. Maintenance worked quickly and was able to get the water turned back on. The rest of my stay| one of the elevators was broken meaning there were only two available for 44 floors of guests. Luckily I was on the eighth floor| so i frequently just used the stairs| but this was a huge inconvenience after a long day when all you want to do is get back to your room quickly.,Sep 6| 2018,3
Wifi was non functional (one bar); the phones in the rooms did not work; the television barely worked (picture was fuzzy); it took my parents hours to check in because a pipe burst on their floor; one of the elevators was broken so only one elevator was servicing 45 floors; overall very disappointing. I’ve stayed in better 1 star hotels in developing countries. Would not stay here again.,Sep 5| 2018,2
Only issue we had was due to an out of service elevator. It caused quite a few delays but the staff was kind and informative regarding the matter.,Sep 5| 2018,4
Long time to check in| elevator not working| no WiFi during the whole stay.,Sep 5| 2018,3
Right in the heart of Wall Street|,Sep 3| 2018,5
Elevators were slow and one was broken making wait times 15 to 20 minutes long. Room size was small but that may be a new york issue.,Sep 3| 2018,2
Great location if you plan visit to Status of Liberty.  5mins walk away to Battery Park. 1mins walk to subway station.,Sep 3| 2018,5
The water wasn’t working. No shower available at night or day of my check out.,Sep 2| 2018,2
Great location. With a friendly staff. Elevators are very slow and cramped. The room was not as clean as expected. It was very great location for dining options.,Aug 31| 2018,4
It was very convienent to many subway stops. It is right on Stone Street giving excellent restaurant choices. And its price was good.,Aug 31| 2018,5
A pleasant| clean| and professionalism shown at all times!!!,Aug 28| 2018,5
The room we had was terrible. You were able to hear everything going on outside the room and the room next door. The room next to us had a baby| that cried all night. With the joining door| it was like the baby was in our room with us.,Aug 28| 2018,2
Check in was chaotic because my room was already taken by another occupant.,Aug 28| 2018,2
My sister and I were very happy with our stay at Doubletree. It was near the church| the subway train| and gave us so much opportunity to do what we enjoy doing most - walk around. We will recommend it to our friends for sure. Thank you for the wonderful experience. More power!!!,Aug 28| 2018,5
Close to 911 museum and other attractions in lower Manhattan. Also close to subway.,Aug 27| 2018,4
Great location near the 9/11 memorial and restaurants,Aug 27| 2018,5
The elevators is a real problem| had to wait a long time every time I needed the elevator.,Aug 27| 2018,4
Great location in the financial district in lower Manhattan. Walking distance to Wall St.| 911 Memorial| the ferry to the Statue of Liberty and more!,Aug 26| 2018,4
Third time stayed there very good.,Aug 26| 2018,4
Great hotel right next to financial district and Battery Park.Rooms are very comfortable and quite spacious for the city.,Aug 26| 2018,5
Very good location and very clean| but elevators are too small| busy and cramped.,Aug 21| 2018,4
Very friendly staff that assisted with all of our needs.,Aug 21| 2018,5
Antica Restaurant was excellent.  The wait for the elevators was awful -they stopped at every floor on the way down| and one was not working. Twice we had to wait 15 minutes for an elevator.,Aug 20| 2018,3
Convenient location| but we had to wait over an hour past the check in time for our room to be ready.  It seemed there was not enough staff to meet the needs of all the customers.,Aug 20| 2018,3
Nice hotel,Aug 20| 2018,4
As pretty much every hotel in NY| it was walking distance to pretty much anything you would want.  Clean overall and comfy beds but it would be REALLY nice to have rooms with 2 queen beds.  Two adults plus a 17 year old son fitting in 2 doubles wasn't fun but it's the room the budget allowed.  At this cost| there should be complimentary breakfast even if it's just cereal or danishes.  The hallways are FREAKISHLY hot!  Normally| that isn't too bad but we were on the 35th floor and there are only 3 elevators and it seems that only 2 run at a time.  So you just kind of sit in the hallway and melt waiting for the elevator.  The wallpaper was peeling in our bathroom and the showers are long and thin so shaving your legs can be a bit of taking your life into your own hands...well| at least taking you ankles in your own hands.  The rooms do get nice and cold.We ate at A LOT of restaurants while we were there...here are 2 that are walking distance from the hotel that were our favorites...1.  Grumpy's!Best coffee and holy smokes| don't miss the almond croissants!  Walk out of the hotel and Grumpy's is just a few short steps away on the right.2.  A Taste of TokyoNICEST people and the best food we had while we were in NY and we ate some pricey 4 and 5 star restaurants.  This wonderful little gem had the friendliest staff and best food!,Aug 20| 2018,4
The room was dirty| the fixtures were falling off the wall and the air conditioner was not working properly. The seal on the shower was broken so the floor was soaked after all our showers. The staff was friendly. Sincerely| Family of four,Aug 20| 2018,2
Access to other surrounding facilities is good.The room is very noisy at night when using the Air Cond and also from other guests coming from the elevators.  No fridge available in the room. No complimentary water on arrival.,Aug 18| 2018,3
Todo ok.,Aug 16| 2021,5
Hotel muy cómodo en la zona financiera| en la esquina hay una estación de metro| las camas son muy cómodas| de lado negativo sólo hay 3 elevadores para 44 pisos y por el momento no hacen limpieza diaria a las habitaciones.,Aug 14| 2021,4
El lugar está muy bien ubicado! Lo único malo fue al hacer el check in la chica nos trató súper mal…,Aug 4| 2021,5
La atencion en la recepción es pésima.  Hice la reservacion con un mes de anticipación y no sirvio para nada me dieron las habitaciones equivocadas . Mal servicio 😡,Aug 4| 2021,1
Tienda cerca del hotel,Jul 26| 2021,4
Personal muy atento| la limpieza por el Covid hay que solicitarla para coordinar la misma| cerca de todo incluyendo muchos restaurantes variados para comer o beber. El elevador es lo único desesperante al esperarlo pero lo demás es súper bueno,Jul 22| 2021,5
Buena estadia,Jul 17| 2021,5

no hacen limpieza a los pasillos,May 20| 2021,2
Demoras en subir el café. Así mismo la limpieza esta restringida de acuerdo a información del Hotel. Solo recogen toallas y sabanas usadas. Y te dejan unas limpias en su lugar. El trato de algunos recepcionistas no era cordial ni amable.,May 6| 2021,3
The position is very convenient| but dust in the room and the hair drier is dirty and sticky,Sep 1| 2020,5

Hôtel super bien situé dans Financial District| proche de plusieurs ligne de subway| proche de des départ pour la statue de la liberté| et proche d'un quartier sympa ayant plein de restaurant.Nous avons passer un super séjour à NYC.,Jan 10| 2020,5
Hotel ist empfehlenswert. Würde auch jederzeit erneut dahin. Frühstücksbuffet ist für amerikanische Verhältnisse auch sehr gut ausgestattet (Rühreier & Bacon; Würstchen und Bratkartoffeln; Pencake; Bagels; Joghurt; Marmelade und Cornflakes sowie frisches Obst)Etwas wenig Ablagefäche im Bad (z.B. einen Handtuchhalter an der Tür für ein Doppelzimmer?) Aber sonst alles super.,Jan 8| 2020,4
Net hotel makkelijk bereikbaar| schoonmaak kamer mocht iets beter.  Maar voor de rest prima uitvals basis.,Jan 3| 2020,4
Das Zimmer war in Ordnung| das Personal sehr freundlich| die Situation mit den Fahrstühlen war oft eine Katastrophe| das Frühstück war toll. Auf heißes Wasser in der Dusche musste man ein bisschen warten| aber letztlich konnte man heiß Duschen und darauf kommt es ja an. Vermisst habe ich eine Handbrause in der Dusche| dies sollte Standard sein.,Jan 3| 2020,3
struttura un pò datata| pecche la moquette e l'impianto di riscaldamento rumoroso| ottima la posizione ed il personale| nel complesso ci siamo trovati bene.,Dec 11| 2019,4
Die Wartezeit an den Fahrstühlen: Katastrophe!Freundlichkeit an der Rezeption: 1 eher unfreundliche Dame und - zum Glück - eine sehr nette Dame! Freundlichkeit und Hilfsbereitschaft des restlichen Personals: super!,Dec 9| 2019,3
Tutto bene tranne la presenza solamente di 3 ascensori per servire oltre 40 piani| spesso l’attesa (specialmente al mattino verso l’orario di checkout) diventa snervante. Sarebbe utile un frigobar in camera ed un condizionatore meno rumoroso,Dec 5| 2019,4
Die Aufzüge brauchen lange (drei für 41 Etagen)| die Gänge sind nicht sehr breit.,Dec 5| 2019,4
Ottimo hotel. La posizione è il vero punto di forza| a due passi da Wall Street| al 9/11 memorial| alla Freedom Tower e ai battelli per la Statua della Libertà. Inoltre vicino all’albergo sono presenti molte fermate della metro che in 20 minuti ti portano in Times Square. In zona sono presenti anche molte taverne e locali molto belli dove si mangia bene.,Dec 1| 2019,4
+:vicinanza alla metro| pochi metri. Vicinanza a punti di interrsse| tranquillità. Pulizia ottima. Personale gentile e collaborativo. Vista. Stanza in ordine|-: però me la aspettavo piu grande.  Ad occhio non più di metri 20/22 . Il sito diceva 32. Armadio troppo piccolo.  Grave per un 4 stelle:  mancanza di frigo!!!! D'estate come fanno???,Nov 25| 2019,4
La struttura è ok. Pulita| ben servita e personale molto gentile e disponibile. Assolutamente inaccettabile| tuttavia| la dimensione della stanza in relazione agli ospiti.,Nov 13| 2019,2

Un personnel fort sympathique| tres professionnel| a l'écoute. Salle de sport pratique. Il est conseillé d'inclure le petit déjeuner| il etait tres bon et copieux. Une remarque sur la clim et les ascenseurs : la clim etait trop forte dans la salle de petit déjeuner| personnellement j'ai trouvé ça abusé (comme a peu pres partout dans New York). Heureusement le personnel etait comprehensif pour arranger cela. Quant aux ascenseurs il y en a 3 et tres souvent occupés en journée donc attente tres longues. Pas pratique d'utiliser les escaliers quand on est au 33ème etage :) Ces 2 points sont anecdotiques| le sejour a ete excellent.,Sep 11| 2019,5

Los elevadores muy muy lentos. Saturado. Zancudos que sacan sangre y dan comezón en la piel. Los tras días tuvimos que pedir que nos limpiaran las habitaciones.,Jul 9| 2019,2
Buena ubicación. Muy cerca del WTC y de otras atracciones. Muy cerca del metro.,Jun 29| 2019,4
The hotel's a little old. So are the hotel rooms. We had to change the room because of a water damage on the ceiling. There were no possibilities to hang things up (towels etc.). The door to the bathroom didn't close properly and the tap couldn't be moved completely. But the location of the hotel is great. Directly at the subway stations. Restaurants were around the corner. Great!,Jun 5| 2019,3
Estoy muy a gusto con todo el servicio y atención en todo tiempo y sobre todo confiabilidad,Jun 4| 2019,5
Die Lage des Hotels ist ok - vor allem| wenn man viel in Downtown erkunden will. Gute Anbindung an die Subway. Zimmer war groß und gut ausgestattet. Sehr schade war| dass ich zwei mal das Zimmer nicht gemacht wurde| als ich erst am späten Vormittag aus dem Zimmer bin. Für ein Hotel dieser Kategorie sehr schwache Leistung,May 25| 2019,4
Excelente estancia| cerca de todo!,May 19| 2019,5
かなり早いチェックインになったが快く受け入れてくれた。部屋もかなり広い。周辺エリアは観光エリアなので飲食店も多く、安全だと思う。ただ狭い路地みたいな所もあるのでそこには行かない方がいい。ただ一点気になった点があるチェックインの時ドアノブの下のネジが外れていて勢いよく閉めると閉まるがゆっくり閉めようとすると閉まらないと指摘したが閉まるから問題ないと言われた。それ以外は問題ない。,May 6| 2019,4
Gute Lage mit Zugang zu allen Subway Verbindungen.Negativ ist die unmittelbar gegenüberliegende Bar mit sehr lauter  Musik bis tief in die Nacht. Zimmer wurden bei sechstägigem Aufenthalt zweimal nicht bzw. nur auf wiederholte Reklamation gereinigt.,Apr 23| 2019,3

Este hotel no puede ser de la cadena Hilton! Vergonzoso!! Las fotos del frente son anteriores a una reforma donde se anexo un resto el el lobby dejando actualmente el ingreso ni parecido. Esta destruido. Malisimo colchon vencido. Muebles en mal estado y viejos. No coincide con las fotos. Esta muy buen ubicado y con dos estaciones de metro muy cercanas| esos son los unicos puntos a favor pero hay mucho mejor opciones por un precio similar. No lo recomiendo en absoluto. Pasamos 20 dias en ese hotel y termine mal de la espalda. Problemas de agua fria y caliente. Mal sistema de calefaccion.,Jan 27| 2019,3

Reception-väen ja ovimiesten palvelu oli loistavaa. Hotelli oli yleisesti hyvässä ja siistissä kunnossa. Siivouksessa hieman parannettavaa| mm. huolellisuudessa (meillä oli likaiset lakanat). Siivooja tuli myös hätistelemään meitä check-out päivänä ennen varsinaista check-out aikaa. Hyvät kulkuyhteydet joka suuntaan| kolme eri metrolinjaa kävelyetäisyydellä. Alueella myös paljon ruokapaikkoja ja kahviloita. Lähellä puisto| josta näkee vapaudenpatsaalle.,Jan 8| 2019,4

Clean and good quality hotel| spacious rooms in NY scale. Sightseeing locations require a subway which is close by. The hotel has a good wifi and the gym is decent for a hotel gym (barbells but no bench press or bar). The rooms were much nicer than I have seen in any midtown hotel which cost more. I would definitely come again to this hotel.,Dec 5| 2018,5

un gran viaje para maraton de NY y un hotel con todas las comodidades y una excelente ubicacion para conocer el bajo manhattan y visitan el centro de la ciudad viajando en el metro a menos de 20minutos | el ferry para la estatua de la libertad a menos de 3minutos caminando  me dejo una grata experiencia,Nov 10| 2018,5

The rooms were nice and spacious.  The bathroom was spacious.  The hotel is near many eateries| so you can walk to nearby delis.  24 hour valet!  You want to go| you can leave in 10 minutes!  Front desk was excellent and housekeeping was very attentive to our schedules.,Aug 2| 2021,5
Everything was great| service| location| cleanliness. Only problem was a constant sound of the vent in the bathroom. After a while we got used to it but I wouldn't stay in the deluxe king again but definitely come back to the hotel. We loved it!,Aug 2| 2021,5
The hotel does not meet the level of expectation for the $279/nt rate. The customer service is lackluster. More importantly there is a mandatory $25 fee that forces you to drink at the bar or buy something from their “gift shop”. Parking options are either very costly and extremely costly. Good shopping in the area.,Aug 1| 2021,3
The hotel and staff were great. The corner room was beautiful. What killed me was the air-conditioning...or rather the lack of it. Our room was soupy despite adjusting it to the lowest temp| highest fan.,Jul 26| 2021,3
(1) Lacking adequate lighting in room; (2) lacking 24 hour access to complimentary coffee| decaf and hot water with lighteners| stirrers| etc. in the lobby;(3) lacking bellboy service;(4) lacking comfortable seating;(5) no longer offering buffet breakfast;(6) hallways looked worn and dingy.At the end of one of the days of our stay we returned in the evening and the room had not been refreshed nor attended to!We felt that overall the hotel had lost much of its former charm and amenities.    :^(,Jul 26| 2021,3
Great location. The staff was very nice and accommodating. The room was nice and clean| and the beds were very comfortable. Overall a very nice experience.,Jul 23| 2021,4
The gentleman who checked me in was awful.  But the lady who checked me out was wonderful.  The restaurant was wonderful as well.,Jul 22| 2021,3
I think you are lucky to have the staff that you have!  Everyone is being asked to work harder- with fewer staff members.  I HOPE you are paying them well!  From housekeeping to waiters to front desk-they ALL were giving it that extra effort!,Jul 19| 2021,4
Room very clean. Building seems new or renovated. Great location.,Jul 19| 2021,5
Although we typically enjoy our stays at Hilton hotels| we were disappointed. Our room’s AC did not work and during peak summer heat and humidity| it made for an uncomfortable stay. The lobby and hallway felt great but as we walked into our room| it felt swampy and warm. We had a quick stay otherwise we would have asked do move rooms. I don’t like when there isn’t a vent in the bathroom to filter some of the humidity that builds up during showers. All of that wet air just sits in the room. I will say that the staff were helpful though. Parking is a bit of a pain| but that is typical for NYC.,Jul 16| 2021,3
Had a great overnight stay. Got to,Jul 13| 2021,5

Great hotel| clean and friendly! Didnt love the $25 dollar 'Urban' credit but we used it to buy the GREAT french frues from the restaurant.  Good hotel for @USSquash tournament at EAC. Would definitely recommend and stay again!,Jul 9| 2021,5
Check in was super fast.  I was only there for one night| and wasn't in the hotel much| so the place being clean| quiet and close to the White Noise coffee shop & the subway were my high points. I felt covid-safe| and the room felt modern and clean. It was an easy Uber to Manhattan for dinner which was nice. I'd def stay here again.,Jul 9| 2021,5
Nicer part of downtown Brooklyn| close to several restaurants| bookstore| movie theater| and more…very walkable. Hotel is very nice inside| rooms spacious| and clean. Staff are very expedient. Highly recommend this hotel!!!,Jul 7| 2021,5
On the hottest day of summer we lost power and took refuge at this hotel.  We were welcomed with an efficient staff| bar| restaurant and a large clean room with excellent bedding.  Ahhh.,Jul 5| 2021,5
It was a very nice. The hotel was in a nice spot and it was clean. Staff was friendlythe price was a little expensive but it was worth it.,Jun 30| 2021,5
We had a nice stay. Check in was extremely smooth and very comfortable beds. The only downside was that we were charged a mandatory $25 fee   tax after the fact. I guess it's on their site| but we booked through Orbitz so we didn't know about it.,Jun 22| 2021,4
Great choice for Brooklyn,Jun 21| 2021,4

Resort fees? In Brooklyn? That expire daily!! Please!! This is just a bait and switch. I was quoted one price| then slammed with a resort fee. I will never stay at another Hilton. Couldn't use the bar as a bar| and I had already made plans before I realized I would be hit with this fee. So that money is gone. (Let us be clear| the staff and location are great.) But resort fees should be outlawed| or incorporated in the price when I look to compare prices!!!,Apr 22| 2021,3
Cleanliness and responsive staff were highlights as well as the best Manhattan’s mixed at the bar!,Apr 20| 2021,5
Breakfast included means certain select items on the menu is complimentary| but they don't tell you that before you order. Have to take the food to go - nowhere to sit and eat. Had to spend 30 mins going back and forth between the bar and reception because our room number wasn't on the list. I've been to way better Hilton's. Hard pass on future trips.,Apr 19| 2021,3
Convenient lobby for check in.  Spacious rooms| cleanliness.,Apr 15| 2021,5
I stayed here for 12 days in Feb (two separate reservations). Great location| the restaurant staff was very friendly and had good quality food. Felt very safe to stay.  Only draw back was the view from the room. No view from the room to speak of. I am staying here again in a few weeks| hopefully I will get a better view and also the complimentary breakfast,Apr 5| 2021,5
The restaurant food was great.The staff definitely gave us the best customer service in the city.,Apr 5| 2021,4
Did like hidden charges..$25.00 for food and beverages charged automatically and client is not informed of these charges,Apr 4| 2021,5
Unexpected charges at check-in. Hotel did not provide a copy of the bill after check-out.,Mar 31| 2021,2
The staff was great. Really nice ambiance. Just had to wait for hours for towels and wash cloths as there was only one in the room. Valet Parking $80| wasn't happy about that.,Mar 30| 2021,4
Didn’t like the paid parking. Also there so no microwave in the room,Mar 29| 2021,3
This hotel is ok. It’s more spacious than some of the other hotels I’ve stayed at in Brooklyn. The main issue I have with this hotel is that they didn’t have any face cloths available whic is weird.,Mar 27| 2021,3
Front desk staff was terrible and unprofessional.,Mar 26| 2021,1
Very convenient location| nearby restaurants and shopping and I like the key feature to use the elevator you must have a room key.,Mar 22| 2021,5
The rooms were so dirty and gross. Are room smelled of smoke and had cigarette burns in the carpet and chairs. One of the chairs in the room had large smelly stain on it. The whole floor smelled of cigar and cigarette smoke| even though it was a non smoking hotel. We changed rooms and there were black hairs all over the linens a pillows| the sheets were stained. Really gross.,Mar 21| 2021,2
The beds were so comfortable and I slept like a baby,Mar 20| 2021,5
The hotel had a clean look and feel. Breakfast was well prepared and tasty. Bed was a bit too soft for our preference| a little firmer might have been better| as we sunk in and woke up with a backache.,Mar 19| 2021,4
Beware they tack on mandatory resort fee that you,Mar 15| 2021,3
It was excellent|Very clean and overall great!!,Mar 14| 2021,5
I booked the Deluxe King room. It was very clean and spacious. Front desk answered any questions I had and they were of so much help.,Mar 12| 2021,5
Descent hotel| clean| staff was very accommodating and will definitely stay again.,Mar 8| 2021,5
It was a good stay. We stayed Valentines day weekend and the room was huge and still one of the most affordable in the Downtown area since it was a holiday weekend. Staff was nice and everything went well,Mar 7| 2021,5
Nice clean place| would recommend to everyone. Would prefer free parking and more parking options,Feb 27| 2021,5
I didn't like service at the front desk| the guy wasn't professional. I expected something more. I've been traveling around the globe for last 10 years| and have been in many Hilton hotels in Abu Dhabi| Seoul| Kuala Lumpur and so on. I asked for late check out| and was told that exactly today they don't do late check out. So I had to book another hotel,Feb 19| 2021,1
I have always had a pleasant experience staying at the downtown Hilton.,Feb 15| 2021,5
Very convenient very clean staff is wonderful Will stay again very soon,Feb 15| 2021,5
I lost my precious Rolex watch in the room and it was never found or returns to me by hotel staff. They claimed they never found it.,Feb 9| 2021,1
Two issues were present with this hotel. First| the rampent drug use was an issue and caused us to need to change rooms through our stay into what felt like a downgraded smaller room. Second| an "urban destination" charge was added to my stay and not clarified to me until checkout. The more frustrating part of this experience is that I was told at checkout that I could have applied this $25 a day fee towards food at the hotel. The employee told me that I should have been notified of this at check-in| however| I was not notified of this. Had I known that I would have eaten at the hotel and saved myself on takeout costs. Honestly| the evasive practices of this hotel were frustrating on top of the the other issues.,Jan 29| 2021,2
This is a great property. Very Clean. Breakfast was awesome. For sure a great stay.,Jan 29| 2021,5
Great hotel in Brooklyn. Friendly professional staff. Very nice atmosphere right downtown,Jan 25| 2021,5
Great location| clean room| matched with an awesome staff. I will definitely be back.,Jan 25| 2021,4
the location was very convenient| you can walk to many restaurants and stores.  Manhattan is also just a short ride away.,Jan 22| 2021,5
Even during a Covid pandemic| we felt safe and well cared for at the Hilton. Their cleaning practices are excellent| and our room was very comfortable. The location of this hotel is also very convenient.,Jan 7| 2021,5
It was a pleasant enough stay in the midst of a pandemic. The staff was helpful and efficient.,Jan 3| 2021,4
A person came in without a mask and i had to tell staff. They cleaned my room when i told them not to enter it during my stay. I had a Covid test and filled out the New York required form and no one asked me for it.,Dec 7| 2020,1
The would have been great if the bathroom was clean and if there wasn’t any urine on. The toilet,Nov 22| 2020,3
It was alright,Nov 20| 2020,4
My stay was comfy! The front desk rep Rick went above and beyond to help me!,Nov 15| 2020,5
I didn't go until Saturday and Sunday. October 30 and October 31 or Monday the 1of November,Nov 5| 2020,3
Stayed one night. Great stay. Room was very clean and comfortable. We ordered breakfast which was delicious.Staff was friendly and helpful. Would def stay here again.,Sep 14| 2020,5
I like that it was Kind of secluded in Brooklyn. I like going to places that aren’t in the middle of too much traffic and this was perfect.,Sep 11| 2020,5
Easy check in| clean rooms| decent gym and close to shopping and restaurants,Sep 11| 2020,4
The hotel was pristine and the room was spacious. The bar service was okay. The drink were average nothing special. The food was surprisingly good.,Sep 10| 2020,5
Room was amazing. Service great. Only issue I had was in the bathroom| a bar of open soap and toiletries were left in the shower on the soap holder. You see something like that its a turn off and it makes one question if the room was properly cleaned| especially in these times.,Sep 2| 2020,5
The Hotel was quiet. The rom was clean.  Their was no Microwave in the room.  Will stay there on my nest trip to Brooklyn Ny,Aug 30| 2020,4
Aesthetically the hotel was in great shape. Check in was mediocre as well as guest services. I checked in after 10:pm at which point I was informed the hotel charges $75.00 PER DAY as a security deposit and than extorts $25.00 from the daily deposit and calls it a resort credit. Basically forcing you to spend an additional $25.00 daily at the bar or order from the restaurant with a very limited menu| that is closed| so you get to take the food to your room if you chose.,Aug 24| 2020,2
The rooms are very nice. Clean and the receptionist was very polite and nice.,Aug 22| 2020,5
Well clean| good services| nice decor| good and safe area,Aug 11| 2020,5
Sheets were dirty. We booked a king bed and were put in a room with two fulls. We asked for toothpaste and they brought us soap. I would not recommend staying here ever.,Aug 10| 2020,1
Great clean place close to al shopping stores in Downtown BK.,Aug 7| 2020,5
Hotel room was nice and clean and staff was polite and helpful | super close to shopping and restaurants | enjoyed my stay definitely will come again,Jul 12| 2020,5
Friendly| helpful staff; but still think room could have been better maintained. Window shade broken on arrival was immediately fixed| but on my last morning| right before checking out| saw broken glass shards behind bathroom sink.,Jul 6| 2020,4
There was no room service| and there were multiple things wrong with the room. The fridge was broken| the doorknob was as well| and the bed was uncomfortable.,Jun 22| 2020,2
Fantastic service! The front desk attendants  truly go out of their way to make your stay perfect!,Jun 14| 2020,5
It was short but sweet and the room was very nice,Mar 16| 2020,5
Great hotel| great service nice room| very clean.,Mar 9| 2020,5
Personal,Mar 9| 2020,5
everything was great except the restaurant. i had to wait 30 minutes for breakfast. it seems thaey prefer to work on people with room service than people in the flesh. i almost had to leave to go to a meeting and as it is had to rush my food. even the grapefruit juice i ordered was only brought when i "tackled" a serveri wasn't the only one annoyedthe desk staff were great| efficient| friendly. it was the restaurant that left the sour taste - sorry about the pun,Mar 9| 2020,4
Front desk very pleasant. 👍 Probably stay there again.,Mar 9| 2020,4
The bed was very comfortable and the room was a good size.,Mar 3| 2020,4
Very good location. Large room and comfortable executive lounge. Very good service.,Mar 1| 2020,4
Great location in Brooklyn.  Good parking facilities,Feb 29| 2020,5
It was cool. The bathroom floors were cold.,Feb 24| 2020,4
Here's why I gave a poor rating.  Hilton| like many hotels| is now using phoney charges on top of the quoted rates.  On this stay| Hilton created a "Urban Destination Charge" of $25.00 per day. With taxes| this comes to $28.69 per day. These charges are theft| they aren't quoted in the daily rate and are only disclosed when you check in.  Nonsense!!!,Feb 18| 2020,4
We stayed here for a show at barclay venter and reviews said it was right around the corner but it is a 30 minute walk.  Found parking on street so disnt have to pay for valet but they charge a $25 resort fee per day so be aware of that added fee!,Feb 10| 2020,4
The cleanliness of facility| location| faculty and complimentary breakfast buffet made the visit very pleasant. The room being a little dusty and not enough toiletries for a couple on a two day stay| were a little disappointing. Nevertheless| my partner and I will return again because the good outweighed the bad.,Feb 6| 2020,4
The service and openness of the staff was outstanding.  Beautiful decorations...,Feb 5| 2020,5
Very friendly helpful staff great rooms comfortable clean,Jan 23| 2020,5
We were supposed to check in at 4 but there were no room available until 5:40! Didn’t give us much time to settle in and get ready for the 7:00 event we were there for.  Although the front desk was very apologetic- we didn’t receive anything for our inconvenience. A credit towards the hotel? A late check out to give us more tone in the hotel??,Jan 12| 2020,4
Great location|  will stay again for sure  a lot of businesses close by,Jan 10| 2020,5
So glad we chose this hotel| it was perfect! Close to shops| train (and easy transfer to New York| 7 stops to mid town). Manhattan was crazy busy and so nice to come back to Brooklyn. Close and uber to Williamsburg to visit| a must. Gospel church (amazing experience) on the next block. Rooms were good size. Really loved our time here.,Jan 8| 2020,5
the only problem was the TV reception for CBS for the Patriots-Titans game.  It was very blurry.  All the other channels were fine but CBS.  So we went downstairs to the bar and there the picture was clear but no sound.  The policy is not to have sound in the bar. Really? Tough to watch a playoff game without sound.,Jan 6| 2020,4
Hilton is trying to screw customers by adding bogus fees and supposed taxes to the final bill. They created an “Urban Fee” of $25.00 per night and two minor taxes for about $5.00 more each night. I was told they were to be removed when I complained at checkin| but they were there at checkout. There’s a reason they let people just leave the hotel these days| so they can rip you off. Always check out and ask for the final statement! The hotel also charges $300 for incidentals and takes three days after checkout  to issue a credit so they have had my cash for over a week before they return it. My room was not clean when it was finally available. The property is nice| room design and bathrooms are nice| location is good. If they weren’t rip-off artists| I would return| it  but Hilton’s added fees and dishonesty is something I can’t accept. Find another hotel.,Jan 6| 2020,2
Need to have bell man to help with luggage from street to lobby or room.,Jan 2| 2020,4
The front-desk staff were polite and helpful| the housekeeping ladies smiling a nd friendly; the restaurant served a very good breakfast every morning. The location was very convenient for our pkans and activities. This hotel will be our choice for future visits to the area.,Dec 27| 2019,5
The hotel's location and amenities are very nice.When we checked in| we had been downgraded from the type of room that we had reserved. The gist of the long discussion I had with the front desk staff| was that because I had a  "third-party" reservation| I did not deserve the type of room that I had reserved.,Dec 23| 2019,4
I had a change of plan and made 3 online attempts to cancel.  The hotels.com site was down. I don’t have time to wait for an expected service.,Dec 22| 2019,3
Nice location| staff were nice and helpful. Room was tidy and clean. Didn’t like the give 75 and 25 for whatever,Dec 19| 2019,5
Enjoyed the stay| very good price as compared to stating the city. Subway easily accessible.,Dec 17| 2019,5
Clean| modern| beautiful| polite people| tried to do everything to accommodate us. And do try the food at the restaurant onsite!,Dec 17| 2019,5
My main complaint is the $25/day "facility fee" (or whatever they call it) which they only tell you about until you check in.  So...be aware of that before you book.  Otherwise| the Internet service was slow| the lighting in  our room was very poor and our room was a bit cramped.  That said|  the beds were very comfortable and the bathroom and bathroom linens are high quality.  Heating/cooling system was very good too.,Dec 15| 2019,3
Check in was less than stellar. We arrived at 4| and yet our room wasn’t ready. I was only staying 1 night| the woman assured me she would tell me as soon as it was ready. 45 min later| I asked| and| the room was now clean| she just did not tell us. Considering I was sitting 15 feet away from her| in clear sight| she could have waved| or something. The room was clean| and comfortable.  The hotel itself is dated| and uninspiring.  At breakfast the next day| my phone rang at 10| telling me to vacate the room. I thought maybe I would get an extra hour to check it|  since check in was not so great.  But that did not happen. Oh| the bartender also sucked.  I stay here because I booked late| nad not much else was available. I know why this was available last minute and  all the other hotels were booked. Not worth the $350.  Don’t do it!,Dec 12| 2019,3
Excellent,Dec 7| 2019,5
Love the beds at the Hilton. But there was a lot of banging. I think it was the cabinets in the room where they keep the fridge. Fridge doors banging off the cabinet doors. I suggest taking the cabinet doors off.,Dec 7| 2019,4
I was here overnight on a business trip in early December.  The hotel was very nice| the bed was comfortable| and the room was spacious and clean.  The buffet breakfast in the morning was very good and was included as a $25 free credit provided at check-in to the hotel's bar and restuarant.  One complaint of mine is that concierge did not let me know that my parking voucher from the affiliated self-park garage had to be validated before my departure.  The garage refused to honor the $30 flat rate for overnight parking even after presentation of a hotel receipt.  The arrogant employee said I had to return to the hotel to get my ticket stamped even through I provided clear evidence of my stay.  Needless to say| nobody has the time or patience to be walking up and down NYC blocks on a weekday winter morning to dispute parking charges.  Hilton needs to be clear with their guests about how their parking arrangements work or they should become affiliated with the parking establishment in closest proximity to the hotel.,Dec 4| 2019,4
The entire hotel especially the rooms are comfortable.Staff is very patient with me and I’m very appreciative of that:),Nov 26| 2019,4
Perfect hotel for our family trip to NYC. Very close to subway stops with multiple train options. Walking distance to Barclays Center. Quiet neighborhood. 20 minute walk to new Wegmans. Lobby and rooms were clean and updated. Would definitely stay again!,Nov 25| 2019,5
On my second night there my bed wasn’t changed/made| towels weren’t changed or picked up and bathroom wasn’t cleaned. Trash wasn’t emptied.When I entered room and saw this I called front desk and they informed me that housekeeping had left for the day. They were apologetic and polite.New towels were brought.,Nov 25| 2019,2
The property was really amazing and its located in a good area.,Nov 24| 2019,5
Staff was very helpful with every question and request.,Nov 12| 2019,5
We enjoyed our stay.  Staff was helpful. Room service was excellent.  The only issue I had was with the charges for valet parking.  I dropped my car off on Monday night at 9pm and picked it up on Tuesday at 12.30 pm.  I was charged for two days of parking. It may be correct technically| but seems unfair to me.,Nov 9| 2019,5
Great hotel| location and service with convenient self parking and food options nearby. Highly recommended if you need to be in downtown Brooklyn.,Oct 29| 2019,5
My stay here was amazing. The staff was super friendly and remembered my name each time I came to the lobby.,Oct 21| 2019,5
Everything's truly great EXCEPT the lobby area could use a free coffee bar/table for folks staying at the hotel.,Oct 18| 2019,5
I was pleasantly surprised at how great the staff/room was! Hilton continues the tradition of elegant hotels.,Oct 16| 2019,5
We wanted a room for the night before our cruise out of Red Hook and to have a bar/dinner/breakfast in house. Did not want to go out anywhere.  The hotel met all our expectations and everything was excellent. Best cheesecake on the planet!,Oct 14| 2019,5
Dining room and service staff needs improvement. People were waited on in the lounge area and forgotten about in the dining room.,Oct 9| 2019,4
There wasn't anything unique about this hotel. It just happens to be in a good location.,Oct 7| 2019,4
A pleasant stay| convenient for local amenities| subway and a 15 minute walk to the Brooklyn Bridge where it’s possible to walk to lower Manhattan,Oct 5| 2019,4
The people werr nice and very friendly.They were nice to talk to about situations. They found me a cab servive that was cheaper than a regular,Oct 1| 2019,5
Convenient location to the subway| clean and spacious room.,Sep 18| 2019,5
very large room. good location| near lots of shopping.,Sep 16| 2019,4
Pretty standard hotel experience| the room was huge| lobby area was nice| elevators were very fast. Unfortunately| my time at this hotel was tainted by the very aggressive housekeeping staff (well| one woman in particular). She knocked on the door at 9am to asked when we would be leaving. I told her 11am (check out time). My friend left the room at 10:30am to catch a flight but I stayed behind|,Sep 4| 2019,4
I loved this location| staff| and accommodations| except I got a lot of bug bites in my room. It's either bed bugs or fleas or something. I woke up on my second night with bites on my legs and arms.,Sep 2| 2019,3
I was satisfied and comfortable with the hotel stay. I did not like that I had to pay $55 for valet.,Aug 30| 2019,4
Location was good| close to shopping and subway,Aug 28| 2019,4
Nice clean hotel affordable priced,Aug 27| 2019,5
Beautiful| clean| spacious. We had a great stay. I’d highly recommend it to anyone,Aug 27| 2019,5
Perfect location close to the train. Elegant| but not pretentious. Bar/Room Service available late.,Aug 27| 2019,5
The rooms were nice| clean| and updated. We had a room facing inner courtyard/adjoining apts. It made for a blissfully quiet room! My only complaint about the room was the bed was firm and my arthritic hips did not so so well on a firm bed. The staff was great!! So courteous and helpful which I find is a rare commodity in NY. There was an incident with a homeless man at the check in desk while I was standing there| I was so impressed with the staffs professional| yet compassionate handling of the situation. A+Not our first trip or stay in Brooklyn but our first at this hotel. We plan on making this our go to Brooklyn hotel! Very happy!,Aug 26| 2019,5
It was clean| I enjoyed the stay,Aug 18| 2019,5
My room had a very strong smell similar to a glade plugin or similar type fragrance. I have a fairly bad sense of smell but this caused me to start sneezing| my nose ran| and my throat hurt. I kept my window open and that helped. But it took about a day or being out of the room before I felt back to normal. Not sure if this is normal or was somehow specific to my room. I probably should have said something| but I got in so late I just wanted to go to sleep| and the next day it was better after leaving the window open. Beyond that the stay was good. The staff were super friendly.,Aug 12| 2019,4
Staff wonderful helpful polite n always smiling n even remembered my name! The best hotel ever n I’ve stayed at many,Aug 7| 2019,5
Likes: spacious| well located Dislikes: shower over bath,Jul 31| 2019,4
Overall a great stay. We did have an issue when we asked to have our room serviced - the fellow who took the call was quite rude. We asked to speak with a Front Desk Manager| and she apologized and resolved the problem.,Jul 30| 2019,4
My stay was amazing and comfortable,Jul 25| 2019,5
The room we were given over look a garage roof and that was supposed to be a suite luxury room far from it from it,Jul 20| 2019,3
Pros: The hotel seems to be an updated older building. Has a modern feel. The staff is polite and helpful. There is a restaurant on-site| but I did not go to it. Contains the usual toiletries| a safe| and a mini refrigerator. Walking distance from Barclay Arena.Cons: Mainly associated with location. It is located across the street from the local jail tower and courthouses. Few options for dining in the near area. Trash bags were piled up along the street in front of the hotel not in barrels or containers (not sure if this is just a New York thing for trash day| but someone needs to change it).Final word: Although the location had its flaws| it was better than most hotels I have been to in NY. You are right in Brooklyn and it is perfect for going to Barclay for a game or concert. The staff was friendly and always greeted you or would have a conversation. All around decent stay.,Jul 10| 2019,3
Good location. Friendly staff. Clean.Con: no outdoor area to accomodate cigar smokers. Had to walk down two blocks to the Nu Hotel to find seating .,Jul 9| 2019,5
Valet parking is expensive & slow & room is small but nice & clean.,Jul 4| 2019,4
Very nice hotel and the staff was great very friendly and service oriented| if I am in BK again I will definitely stay here.,Jul 3| 2019,5
It was amazing!,Jun 24| 2019,5
This hotel has bed bugs. Please investigate!!,Jun 13| 2019,2
Awesome!,Jun 13| 2019,5
The gentleman who met us at check in was rude and dismissive. Lucky for him the rest of the desk staff and the bell boys were delightful or we would have changed hotels,Jun 11| 2019,4
This hotel had a great breakfast and comfortable beds.,Jun 6| 2019,5
Great stay overall. Fresh feeling hotel with quiet rooms - at least| my room was super quiet. My one big gripe is the terrible WIFI. I feel like hotels in NYC should have good tech| and I both had a very difficult time connecting but also when I did had super slow connection. Part of this is the Hilton trap perhaps| by which I mean| you get "Free" wifi but it is snail pace slow| and you have to pay to get anything decent. When will hotel chains like Hilton realize that this is the 21st century and customers just expect fast and free wifi (Europe does this better!)? And giving us that just is a major reason we will keep coming back. Still - room and bathroom and service were all "A" level.,Jun 5| 2019,4
We attended our daughter’s graduation from NYU.  Hotel Was convenient to subway that got you into Manhattan.  Close to shops and restaurants and the Brooklyn Promenade.  Clean and very very comfortable.  Highly recommended!,May 30| 2019,5
Gross carpet,May 28| 2019,5
Very clean.  In the middle of everything. Friendly employees.,May 27| 2019,5
Great position for Brooklyn shops and subway to other parts of NY.,May 22| 2019,5
We enjoyed our stay and were very comfortable.  We didn't interact with the staff much as we were out most of the two days we were there.  When we did| they were very accommodating but very busy.  Maybe they were understaffed.,May 19| 2019,4
Really just to be alone  my everything| in our lives now we rearly get time like this.,May 15| 2019,5
Staff - very helpful| professional| excellent interpersonal skillsProperty- well located and attractive,May 14| 2019,5
I felt that room service should start earlier| so I had breakfast downstairs which I got a cup of coffee| a cup of scrambled eggs and some bacon|  it was $27.22 plus tip.  more than double room service and the guy followed me around like I was a criminal.  Had I know that it was going to cost me 30.00 for a little bit of egg and bacon I wouldn't have gotten it.  It wasn't worth it.  Disappointed in this.,May 8| 2019,4
The place was nice but the bathroom had a moldy smell to it| which ruined everything. I hated the smell| it smelled like the curtain was very moldy. That was a big disappointment.,May 8| 2019,3
I stayed here for a staycation and it was well worth my time! Great staff and amenities will have me return sooner than later,May 1| 2019,4
Friendly| welcoming staff. Good size room for NYC well appointed and clean. Would definitely stay here again.,Apr 23| 2019,5
Location suited our needs for relatives and dining,Apr 23| 2019,5
We were only there one night so didn't get to use the gym and some of the other facilities. The hotel was really nice in terms of room and bathroom size| cleanliness and location.It was great for walking to Dumbo| the bridge and there were so many restaurants (French Louie - yummy - right around the corner).Thumbs up,Apr 23| 2019,4
Very nice stay| super-friendly staff. Great Brooklyn,Apr 21| 2019,5
Gret,Apr 9| 2019,5
The location was great for where i had to go. Nice bar area. Service in the restaurant at dinner was pleasant enough| but reallllly slowwww. The morning I checked out i just wanted a cup of coffee at the bar.  The guy never aknowledged me and finally i gave up after he served multiple patrons who came well after I did.,Apr 6| 2019,4
The hotel was fine| in line with other Hilton's. A perfectly fine business travel hotel. However| when traveling for work| the one thing you need is internet access.  The hotel offers free internet| but that free internet is sporadic at best. I mentioned it to the front desk and they offered no accommodation. I know I can pay an additional $15 per day to get what I suppose is more reliable internet| but when you are already paying several hundred dollars a night for a room| the free internet should at the very least work. It might be slower| but it should work. This did not. I wasted a half hour in the morning before a meeting trying to get connected| I only had one hour to prepare| with a similar issue the following days. I was there for three nights and wished I had stayed elsewhere so I would have been able to get some work done. I ended up using my phone as a hotspot| but the hotel also only had 1 bar or cellular signal so| the hotspot was very very slow.  For this reason alone| I would not stay here while traveling for business.,Mar 28| 2019,4
Wonderful stay.  Loved it. Will stay again for the right price. Thank you,Mar 28| 2019,5
Location and cleanliness . Central to a lot of things.,Mar 18| 2019,5
Nothing unique| nothing displeasing.Well located for public transport,Mar 11| 2019,4
Everything was in mint condition.  The staff was friendly| helpful and professional.  The doorman described amenities in the vicinity and he quickly called taxis.  The food was tasty and well prepared. They are honest and helpful.  I left a pair of shoes when I checked out and I was able to call and get them back two days later when I returned to Brooklyn.,Mar 7| 2019,5
The room was big. That it served food. The food was good. The people were friendly. And the people were excellent.,Mar 4| 2019,5
The rooms appeared to look clean because of the lighting. the linen was dirty & there was dust on the phone and on the furniture. It was the worst Hilton I've ever Been in .,Mar 3| 2019,1
The only problem was the weather. It was extremely cold. I will visit a different time of the year. Hotel accommodations were good. Prices were very inflated and food service was not good.,Feb 28| 2019,4
Nice hotel| nothing especially fancy| but nice and clean and a HUGE room.,Feb 28| 2019,5
Location was great as we had a wedding to attend in Brooklyn.,Feb 26| 2019,5
Great property in great location| but what stood it apart was the staff.  ALL staff were attentive and friendly.  Really made a difference.,Feb 26| 2019,5
This property was in downtown Brooklyn and perfectly located. It was near several restaurants| subway| corner stores| the Fulton Mall| and the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir. It was a very nice facility with contemporary furniture.,Feb 25| 2019,5
My mom and I stayed from Thursday to Saturday. Location was great| close to everything.  The staff were very friendly.  The young lady who came to clean the room was so wonderful.,Feb 7| 2019,5
Bed was super comfortable. Loved the bedding. Nice fluffy pillows. Felt homey. Bathroom was great. Great design. loved the tiles and shower pressure was strong.,Feb 3| 2019,4
Only complaint is there was no sanitizer in the gym to wipe off the equipment after I used it.  Otherwise it's a very nice property.Very helpful staff!,Feb 3| 2019,5
Very clean and great check-in staff. Rooms were more spacious than what I’m used to in NYC.,Jan 29| 2019,5
Nicely updated.  Rooms and fitness center clean with good balance of weights and cardio options.  Convenient location in nice neighborhood.,Jan 27| 2019,5
The staff was courteous and very efficient. Service was of a high standard. Bar and kitchen staff ensured that both drinks and meals were served in a timely manner and of  utmost quality.,Jan 11| 2019,5
Its always a great experience at the Brooklyn Hilton,Jan 7| 2019,5
Hotel is magnificent in a great location. However the only problem is the price for parking.,Jan 7| 2019,5
Nice hotel at reasonable rates. Good option if you want to escape crowds of manhattan with plenty of shopping and dining options nearby,Jan 7| 2019,5
The stay was okay but I woke up early enough ready to have breakfast| only to be told that breakfast wasn't included. Disappointed!!!Besides| I was given a room which had stuff in the closets. There was no place for me to put my jackets and coats. That's very inconsiderate of any guest who books that room.,Jan 6| 2019,3
Had previously stayed at a different hotel franchise that costs more than the Hilton and decided to stay here to compare the two for costs vs comfort. This hotel is very comfortable and the accommodations are well worth the stay. Parking is down the block but only a minutes walk and cheaper than other hotels. Breakfast buffet was great| with made to order options.  Staff was friendly and room clean| so all in all a great place to stay while on business.  I will be back,Jan 4| 2019,5
Really nice hotel. Good location. Staff very friendly and helpful. Would stay here again.,Jan 1| 2019,5
Welcoming| staff was courteous and responded to my questions and concerns immediately. I didn’t have a remote in my room. The front desk was prompt and housekeeping got it to me instantly.,Jan 1| 2019,5
Room with bed is comfortable and looks goodFoods at the hotel restaurant is good and we recommend it to those who do not know where to go yet,Dec 29| 2018,4
Very impressed with this hotel. Every aspect of my stay was 5 star. The room was large with a king size bed| large window. Excellent linens| very comfortable bed| good pillows| and exceptionally clean. Very nice size bathroom. Everyone I encounter was very helpful and pleasant.,Dec 27| 2018,5
Hotel staff was very friendly hotel very clean bar on first floor excellent location i will def stay again,Dec 23| 2018,5
This hotel is excellent from the minute you walk in until checkout. The rooms are well maintained| very comfortable and clean.Location is right by several metro stations so its easy to get around. Will absolutely stay there again when in Brooklyn.,Dec 19| 2018,5
Staff were very accommodating. Unfortunately| there is no parking onsite.,Dec 18| 2018,5
The room was very large| everything was clean| and the staff was friendly.,Dec 16| 2018,5
Typical size NYC hotel room| but had everything we needed including a gym and in room cooling drink refrigerator.  Pleasant staff and hotel restaurant had good food and drinks.,Dec 4| 2018,5
We had a great stay at the Hilton Brooklyn. Will be our go to place when we visit our son in Brooklyn.,Dec 1| 2018,5
Clean and just the right size room.  Bed is comfortable. Staff is excellent.,Nov 26| 2018,5
It’s was a really nice hotel I’ll recommend it,Nov 25| 2018,5
Wonderful location with comfortable rooms and friendly staff,Nov 19| 2018,5
Great stay. Breakfast was the only weak spot. There was a shortage of staff workin so getting anything not on the messy buffet was very difficult.,Nov 12| 2018,5
Very nice hotel. Room heating system very wierd- difficult to heat room,Nov 11| 2018,4
I was so disappointed by our stay. Had reserved a room with king sized bed. And had called the hotel to tell them we’d be late. When we checked they said there were no more rooms with king sized beds. Our TV didnt work so someone had to come up several times to fix it. Sheets were dirty. I was so disappointed and it was a birthday weekend getaway.,Nov 9| 2018,1
Great location| good morning breakfast. Poor "complementary wifi - very slooooow.,Nov 7| 2018,4
great spot| lots to do nearby| and steps from subway,Nov 7| 2018,4
Great little hotel in Brooklyn. We’ve stayed at others in the area and this is the best. Spacious rooms for NYC. Clean| quiet and a restaurant!,Oct 31| 2018,5
Beautiful room clean surrounding great staff.,Oct 27| 2018,5
AmazingClean Quiet,Oct 17| 2018,5

Had an amazing stay favorite to go if I need a break or vacation.,Oct 2| 2018,5
Wonderful service. Called for breakfast few minutes after 11 and they still took our order and room service. Overall a super place to stay. Loved the cleanliness.,Sep 22| 2018,5
The hotel was really nice. Convenient location and nicely appointed. My only real issue was that my TV could not be turned on without having to mess around with the plug for every time.,Sep 22| 2018,4
Overall I had a pleasant stay at this hotel| it doesn't offer the warm cookie on check in though!!! The room was spacious & housekeeping was excellent. It's approx 5-7 mins walk to the nearest subway station| Dominoes pizza| bakery & Baskin Robbins etc... Generally| the reception staff were nice| quite formal which is okay| but lacked the personable touch. However| one exception in the shape of Masood who was attending at breakfast was a really nice guy| he was very helpful & explained the use of the lounge. The girl who checked me in failed to mention the complimentary drinks & snacks in the lounge or drinks from the reception area. Also| despite there being 4 guests in my room| housekeeping kept leaving 2 towels!!! Front desk were happy to bring extra up. No shuttle bus service available| no bathrobes| misplaced towel rail in bathroom| no long closet to hang dresses| overall though this is a clean| conveniently situated hotel.,Sep 13| 2018,4
Great comfortable bed| good TV| only 3 minutes walk to 4 subway lines| nice and clean.,Sep 13| 2018,4
Excellent customer service and clean and convenient walking distance to most places..,Sep 10| 2018,5
Staff was very helpful and friendly. Room was clean.,Sep 6| 2018,4
Friendly staff willing to help. Nice rooms and walk in shower.,Sep 3| 2018,5
Close to family ... close to Manhattan ... close to mass transit ...,Aug 31| 2018,4
Great location!  Close to subway stops and great Brooklyn restaurants| shops| activities.  Property is almost new| very clean and beds are very comfortable.  Staff very pleasant and helpful.  Will definitely stay here again in the future.,Aug 28| 2018,5
We absolutely LOVED our stay at Hilton Brooklyn.  We were up in Brooklyn to drop our daughter off at Pratt.  Very emotional and the staff couldn't have been more helpful.  We will be back for Parents Weekend!!!,Aug 22| 2018,5
It was awesome !,Aug 22| 2018,5
A very comfortable and clean hotel. The are super welcoming and rooms are very spacious.,Aug 20| 2018,5
Stayed for three nights| hotel seemed| clean| simple and stuff was friendly.The only thing i missed to have drinks and snacks in my room. However| there were drinks| coffee satiation and infused water in the lobby at all times.,Aug 20| 2018,4
We had a wonderful stay at the Hilton Brooklyn NY. The service was great| the check-in was easy and we were close to many 'touristy" things in our plan. We loved the spacious room and the very cozy beds. We will definitely stay here again!,Aug 15| 2018,5
Great experience great location..will definitely come back,Aug 4| 2018,5
It was a very nice hotel actually booked another Hilton for my next visit in October| only will ask that the place in the room complimentary bottle water and not have to call for them,Aug 3| 2018,5
Excellent hotel. Clean| spacious for NYC| and excellent breakfast. Location only a short walk to Brooklyn heights shopping and restaurants. I would stay there again.,Aug 2| 2018,4
Property is new and clean; the rooms are classy and the beds comfortable (but I was disappointed there wasn't a tub or a microwave).  It feels crowded and narrow| but otherwise a fine| newer hotel.,Aug 2| 2018,4
The hotel was great - perfectly located to explore Brooklyn| and to get in to Manhattan. The rooms were large and comfortable.,Jul 29| 2018,5
Great Hotel| Great staff. I loved my stay. I’ll be making another trip to Brooklyn this year and this will be my hotel of choice when I return.,Jul 24| 2018,5
Great weekend stay in the heart of Brooklyn| NYC. Very professional front desk  ambassadors. Great amenities.,Jul 24| 2018,5
perfect place to stay....close to the subway station.  Incredibly clean| comfortable and plenty of room for all.  Don't hesitate to book this hotel!,Jul 23| 2018,5
comfortable stay,Jul 22| 2018,4
Very quiet despite being in downtown Brooklyn. Lots of great neighborhood restaurants in the vicinity.  Staff was lovely and helpful. Would stay here again without hesitation. Valet parking is $55| the only negative.,Jul 21| 2018,5
The room alarm clock was set to 1.5hrs ahead. The AC was very good... a bit too good| I needed to use the additional blanket from the closet. But overall I had lovely stay.,Jul 7| 2018,5
Very inconvenient that Expedia did not have our reservation correct and spent an hour on the phone trying to resolve the day of check-in...the hotel staff and hotel was very nice and clean. However the last night of our stay there was a couple physically fighting and yelling/cursing very loudly next door that I had to call security for...security was quick to respond but since I have two younger children| did not sleep well or feel safe after the incident,Jul 6| 2018,3
The nicest place we've been at in Brooklyn-- clean| new and good service. Only negative thing was that the wifi was a bit spotty at times.,Jul 5| 2018,4
Hotel location is great coming in or leaving Brooklyn. Comfortable and clean rooms| friendly staff.  I will highly recommend it,Jul 3| 2018,4
The room was clean and comfortable I enjoyed my stay the staff was very helpful and professional,Jul 3| 2018,4
Good location and reasonable price. I enjoyed my stay.,Jun 27| 2018,5
A very solid hotel experience.  Not flashy| but very competent in the best sense of the word.,Jun 25| 2018,4
It was okay.  It’s a hotel... what else is there to say? Cha Cha Cha.,Jun 6| 2018,4
We stayed for two days.  Our room was clean| updated| and nice.  The bed was extremely comfortable and the sheets were very soft.  We had breakfast at the restaurant both days which was very good with a wide variety of choices.  I would stay there again.The only thing was that it was difficult to get a cab as they were not hanging around like they do in other hotels.  We ended up taking an Uber| which was fast and efficient.,May 21| 2018,5
Clean| friendly| comfortable.OK neighborhood.,May 14| 2018,4
We were there for our 45th anniversary.  From the doorman to the front desk to room service waiter to housekeeping. All very nice.Our room was very comfortable| and spotless.  Lots of places to eat.... I would not recommend room service.  A simple grilled cheese with meat. Very little meat in the center of the sandwich with an inch of bread all around. And I don't know where the cheese was because it wasn't in my sandwich.Not far from the subway. Felt like a pretty safe place in day and early evening. We weren't out late.  I would stay there again if in the area.,May 10| 2018,5
Easy access very big room especially for nyc. Only minutes from manahatten,May 4| 2018,5
Its always a pleasure to stay here. The pillows are the most comfortable pillows i ever laid my head upon. Like sleeping on clouds.,Apr 25| 2018,4
We absolutely loved this hotel. The location was great and the room was nice big and airy. The staff was very accommodating and the downstairs bar and restaurant were great for happy hour and food. We would definitely stay here again!,Apr 24| 2018,5
Friendly staff. Big room on the executive level. Tasty food on the room service menu.,Apr 17| 2018,4
Stayed here the first time about a week after it opened in 2016. It was very nice and comfortable. This time| though the staff was excellent| we thought the room didn’t seem as nice. Had the excecutive level room| just wasn’t what I feel a Hilton should be. Room seemed already a bit worn in just over a year. And the housekeeping never even came the second day. I was compensated for the inconvenience| again front desk was great. Because family lives near by we will probably stay again and give it another try. Do hope it improves or we will have to look else where.,Apr 12| 2018,4
Very nice| was located near our destination and was super clean.  The staff were friendly and helpful,Apr 9| 2018,5
We got into the city and had to find a place to stay once we arrived because our previous plans of staying with friends fell through. We found this hotel right in the middle of downtown Brooklyn and were able to get a room on the spot. Very clean and cozy and within walking distance of a ton of shopping| restaurants| and the subway station. Would stay there again!,Apr 9| 2018,5
Great 4 day stay in brooklyn. Room was great except for lighting. Bright spot lights were the only lights in the room| except bathroom.,Apr 5| 2018,4
Great location. Very friendly staff and clean comfortable room :),Apr 5| 2018,5
Bellhop was great!!!!  We stayed for 1 night the room was small| but clean.  The hotel is new (2016) and feels that way.,Mar 25| 2018,5
Staff was very friendly. I am visually impaired and the guy at the desk walked me to my room.,Mar 22| 2018,5
Wonderful stay. Hotel is luxury in every way.,Mar 16| 2018,5
Only stay one night but it don't take that long to fix a gas/hit water problem.  That was something hotel could've of metion before checking in. NOT VERY HAPPY WILL NEVER BOOK THIS HOTEL AGAIN,Mar 2| 2018,1
one of the best places in brooklyn.  enjoyed the proximity to bars| restaurants| and subway stations.  will recommend definitely.,Feb 26| 2018,5
The king suite had exceptionally generous space and was perfect for a family with the separate bedroom. Only complaint is that. considering this is a brand new Hilton| the quality of the lighting in the room was poor and the walls were surprisingly bare. Overall would come back primarily for the space and comfortable bedroom. Staff were very helpful.,Feb 21| 2018,4
Apparently| the hotel deal involved assigning what some might view as less desirable rooms| in this case a handicapped access room.  After we adjusted to the idiosyncrasies| we decided it was worth it to have the extra space.  Staff were great and the location was perfect.  Would stay in Downtown Brooklyn again and be happy to return to the Hilton.  Just  wish Hotels.com made it clear that we would have a handicapped access room.,Feb 20| 2018,5
Everything about the stay was great.  Wound up staying a second night (flight cancelled) and the second room smelled a bit of whatever cleaning agent but not a terribly big deal.,Feb 13| 2018,4
From beginning to end| I enjoyed my Hilton experience. The staff was wonderful & very accommodating. The rooms were spacious| clean & comfortable. Each time I stay at the Hilton| I leave with a smile on my face| looking forward to my next stay.,Feb 5| 2018,5
Pros: hearty breakfast and location Cons: room could have been a bit cleaner and our room wasn’t serviced one of our three nights there. They also seemed to be short-staffed the weekend that we visited. Front desk not picking up in time and room service closing sooner than expected.,Jan 29| 2018,3
Large rooms are hard to find in NY hotels| but this Hilton's room was huge. The beds were excellent - thankfully not that spongy foamy Temperwhatever. The shower had great pressure and was excellent. The tub was clean. No complaints except for a noisy neighbor who calmed down.,Jan 22| 2018,5
Had a good stay in this hotel. Good central position for Brooklyn shops etc. and close to subway stations ( Jay street the one we used mostly) The housecleaning was great.The let down here was the front of house staff. Very nice but didn't carry through with our requests - When we first checked in they gave us a standard room although we had booked a larger accessible room. Nothing was said until I asked and then it was an excuse that nothing was available that night. We were shifted the next day. Our coffee machine broke down halfway through the visit. We asked three times for it to be fixed or replaced. Nothing was ever done which meant no room coffee for the last 3 days of our stay. We felt the poor follow up to our requests was not good enough for a 4 star Hilton.,Jan 21| 2018,3
Had a wonderful stay!,Jan 15| 2018,5
The hotel staff were fantastic. Always ready to help.,Jan 11| 2018,5
Everything was great| only complaint was that there was SO much snow in the street right in front of the hotel| made unloading the car difficult and messy. It was unsightly. I understand that the city just does what it does when it "plows" but the Hilton should have had that area cleaned up on their own dime.  Most other businesses in the area clearly did just that.,Jan 8| 2018,5
This Hilton goes above and beyond to make sure you are taken care of while in NYC. Wonderful staff| clean rooms| comfortable beds and good food. Couldn’t ask for anything more!,Jan 6| 2018,5
For the price I paid the parking should have been free . I paid an extra 200.00 dollars for parking my car...Wow next time I will for a Hilton in S.I. at least yhe parking is free.,Jan 2| 2018,4
Fabulous!!!!  Will stay there again!!!,Dec 30| 2017,5
This hotel is very nice and clean also comfortable i was surprised the room was so big bcuz i know hotels in newyork are very small but it was good hotel for the price will be back for sure.,Dec 27| 2017,5
The place was clean| newly designed and furnitured| only complaint I have that the TV had no connection to net and wasn't Netflix available ...otherwise satisfied.. :),Dec 25| 2017,4
This hotel is beautiful| we were treated so nicely by everyone who worked there. Love the Peter Thomas Roth toiletries too! We booked this hotel because we had tickets to see the Nets play at Barclays Stadium which was a 20 min walk. We were also able to walk to all the bars and restaurants on Smith Street which is right around the corner from the hotel| perfect! They even have valet parking so we never had to deal with our car until we checked out and then they had it waiting out front for us! Definitely highly recommend this Hilton!,Dec 24| 2017,5
Good hotel clean nice staff | the food for room service was poor and expensive,Dec 22| 2017,4
We checked in late was told that our booking has been canceled| which was fully paid - without any communication. We were accommodateed but with the a different room we paid for| and also my card is charged twice the amount| i was told that i’ll get the amount back to my card which I hope so. Overall not a great experience.,Dec 19| 2017,2
We all enjoyed are stay here.  Rafael went above and beyond at the bar.  Thank you.,Dec 3| 2017,5
the room was registered with 3 guests - only 2x sets of glasses and paper cups. After numerous contact with front desk & housekeeping| still 2x sets of glasses and paper cups for the 7 days stay.   WiFi was out for 3/7 days.  Bath tub drainage was poor.,Dec 1| 2017,2
WiFi was down the time I was there| toilet was flooded everytime I tried to flush,Dec 1| 2017,3
Room is large| wonderfully designed and quiet. Bed is comfortable and welcome (considering my stressful day). Staff was awesome and accommodating. Love this hotel. I just happened to get a great deal. Just love this place!,Nov 30| 2017,5
Awesome,Nov 29| 2017,5
This hotel seems quite new. On checkin| I was upgraded to a wheelchair accessible room| with a king size bed| even though I don't use a wheelchair. The room was very spacious and comfortable. The placement of everything in the room seemed optimized for people using wheelchairs| such as the closet (low)| and the window shades are operated electronically. There is plenty of desk space to work| and plenty of electric power outlets. Internet had no problems. I didn't try the restaurant. The menu looked appealing. There is a diner one block away that opens earlier in the morning than the hotel restaurant. The staff were very helpful and efficient.,Nov 29| 2017,5
I really enjoyed my stay. Clean and Comfortable room.,Nov 28| 2017,5
Bed was a little saggy. WiFi was down for our entire stay (Thurs-Sun.)| room not ready til 5pm of checkin day. Fantastic location| friendly helpful staff.,Nov 27| 2017,3
Very pleased with the room| clean| comfortable.  Hotel near main attractions.,Nov 27| 2017,5
Great! Beautiful room with all the comfort needed! We will definitely be back!,Nov 27| 2017,5
Took forever to check in because they didn't know if the room was ready or not even though we checked in after 9pm. Also I asked for my valet car ready by 11:45 am and when I got down at 11:50| they forgot about it and got my car at 12:05 pm and was late for my meeting. The phone for the hotel wasn't working and Internet didn't work. I know the spectrum phone line was cut off so this wasn't hiltons fault but it was quite difficult to function without the Internet service. I called the Hilton corporate line because the hotel phone wasn't working to let them know about my late check in| the rep on the phone was not very nice and sounded like he didn't want to be there at work. Overall horrible experience from beginning to end. I travel a lot and always have been using Hilton property but this was definitely one of the worst experiences.,Nov 26| 2017,3
Excellent location in Downtown Brooklyn| close to subways and walk to Dumbo and waterfront park. Gorgeous| spotless| and very helpful polite staff. I've visit Brooklyn regularly| this is my new go-to hotel.,Nov 22| 2017,5
Very nice,Nov 21| 2017,5
The Hilton Brooklyn is a great hotel.  It is a little further from the main sites than some other hotels but only by 5 minutes walk.  Have stayed here a couple of times and service is good as you would expect and rooms are of a high standard.,Nov 21| 2017,4
Clean and great location! Staff are friendly and professional| made my stay very pleasant. Would book again.,Nov 20| 2017,5
Very good location for getting to Manhattan and other tourist attractions without having to live stay in Manhattan.,Nov 19| 2017,4
My room was a low floor next to gym and business center and with little natural light. My only complaint with hotels.com is it seems that I often get what is one of the least desirable rooms in the hotel.,Nov 18| 2017,3
New York City so much to see .  One of a kind place to go . I hope to be back for another Boxing match and see more of city that I missed.,Nov 13| 2017,5
best hotel in downtown brooklyn. also we opted for the breakfast inclusive. great spread and deal!,Nov 8| 2017,5
I checked into the Hilton Brooklyn on 10/18|rm  409 I was getting married on the 19th and thought it would be nice to get dressed there before my wedding and then spend the night there.The thermostat was broken and whenever we adjusted the temperature the room became extremely hot or extremely cold. On the 18th me and my husband did not complain but on the 19th it was really uncomfortable as we spent more time in the room. The makeup artist came over to do my makeup and it was very uncomfortable as well and by the time she was done I was already sweating off my makeup and hair. That night we went downstairs to by water and we told the representative at the desk that our room was really| she commented that they were sold out and could not change the room. We did not sleep that night every time we adjusted the temperature it was freezing or extremely hot. We called the front desk and told them about the temperature and asked if we could have some water as we had already spent $9 on water earlier that night. The representative that answered the phone told my husband if we wanted water he had to go downstairs to the gift shop and purchase it. So of course that’s what we did. My hair was sweating out the bed was wet| it was really bad. In addition the bed so so uncomfortable My husband didn’t sleep at all which means I didn’t sleep at all. In  the morning when we went to check out we let the front desk know what happened and the representative stated that they were sold out and sh,Oct 22| 2017,1
no bathrobes| no water in rooms  (even for a charge) .  the usual empty minibar - ludicrous for people who are staying two days.Went did Hilton experience become so Motel 6,Oct 20| 2017,3
The front desk clerks were awesome and super helpful.,Oct 17| 2017,5
Hotel was surprisingly nice and seemed pretty new... I have low expectations for NYC hotels| but the facility was sleek| the room clean and modern| and not a tiny shoebox either.  Staff were friendly and accommodating.  Definitely not a budget option| but not bad for the area.  Located in a neat part of Brooklyn to explore.,Oct 16| 2017,5
Perfect location for exploring Cobble Hill and downtown Brooklyn. Close to subways but very quiet and comfortable. Right next to Macy's.,Oct 9| 2017,5
My best friend and I attended the Brooklyn Tabernacle Music Conference this past weekend and stayed at the Hilton Brooklyn. We could not have asked for a better location and accommodations. The Hilton Brooklyn is one block from BTab. The hotel is new| rooms are very spacious| and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Cleanliness of rooms and facility was top-notch! Highly recommend.,Oct 3| 2017,5
I give my experience 4 stars overall.  Room service messed up on my food and they replaced it and gave me 50% discount.  Food is nice and the staff is wonderful. I look forward in going back but would choose a different type of room,Sep 29| 2017,4
We missed our flight out and stayed here it was fantastic.  It was like a last minute getaway lol.,Sep 26| 2017,5
The hotel has an excellent location| staffs are competent and helpful| the room is spacious| clean and very comfortable.,Sep 22| 2017,5
Great place to stay,Sep 21| 2017,4
We were attending the Jazz Age Lawn Party and the hotel was perfect for the ferry to Governor's Island| Restaurants| Shops and my daughter's apartment in Carrol Gardens.,Sep 1| 2017,5
Great Brooklynn location with easy access to Lower Manhattan!  Hotel was very clean and staff were incredibly helpful and accommodating!,Aug 31| 2017,5
Hotel was lovely| clean and in great location to Afropunk festival. Hotel staff were very accommodating to our needs. I will definitely stay there next year when we return. Brooklyn Hilton made my first trip to Brooklyn all the more enjoyable.,Aug 30| 2017,5
I stayed for two nights. I didn't spot too many dealbreakers if not any. Solid hotel inside out. :),Aug 30| 2017,4
Nice clean hotel.  Updated and near subway.,Aug 18| 2017,5
I am joyed my stay for service was excellent and the pictures of the hotel or just fix that how it looks I love it,Aug 13| 2017,5
I had a wonderful stay at the Hilton in Brooklyn. The room was clean and spacious and everyone was super friendly and helpful. It is close to the subway and the Brooklyn Heights Promenade and the surrounding area. I would highly recommend.,Aug 8| 2017,5
I have a great experience and highly recommend this hotel,Aug 8| 2017,5
nice experence,Aug 7| 2017,5
We stayed at The Hilton Brooklyn with my son for my friend's wedding. Our room was clean and had great views with three large windows. Although the website said that it had a microwave and chair/sofa by the window| which it did not. It only had a desk chair. My friend had a suite that was less great. The TV would not connect to the WiFi| it did not have a long mirror (only the one in the bathroom over the sink)| and we had to call multiple times to get extra chairs in the room. The executive lounge and breakfast was great! However|the restaurant and room service is lacking when it comes to food for children. Its menu is geared more toward adults.,Aug 7| 2017,4
Nice hotel close to three different subway stations.,Jul 30| 2017,4
Great hotel for the family!!!It was amazing and service top notch !,Jul 29| 2017,5
Clean and comfortable,Jul 22| 2017,5
This was one of the best properties we have ever stayed in! The location was right at the 'A' train. The neighborhood was safe and warm. The staff was fantastic. Parking was right next to hotel and only $28/day (a bargain for NYC). Can't wait to come back!,Jul 18| 2017,5
just any overall great stay|  nice rooms|  beds are very comfortable|  staff very friendly.,Jul 8| 2017,5
Staff were courteous and professional| location of the hotel was centralized and close to a lot of restaurants and  tourist sites,Jul 4| 2017,5

Hilton Brooklyn was a lovely hotel right in the heart of Brooklyn.  We had a great stay there.,Jun 26| 2017,5
Totally enjoyable trip. Hotel was excellent. Service was outstanding.   All the hotel employees were knowledgeable |friendly |and very helpful.  The bellboy and valet person were excellent also.

Very spacious for a NYC hotel. Very clean and comfortable. Surprisingly quiet. And easy to get around. Highly recommend the hotel.,Jun 5| 2017,5
This hotel was a pleasant surprise.  The hotel is located in downtown Brooklyn and in close proximity to transit| shopping| and dining.  The hotel is also in walking distance to Dumbo which also has a lot of trendy restaurants and shops.  Overall| the hotel was great with nice staff| large rooms| and a restaurant with a bar in the hotel lobby.  I would definitely stay here again.,May 31| 2017,5
its amazing. Would definitely stay here next time.,May 26| 2017,5
This hotel was amazing.  It's in my favorite Brooklyn neighborhood| great rooms| and amazingly friendly service. Next time I'm in Brooklyn| I'll definitely be staying here!,May 20| 2017,5
Very nice hotel. Beautiful room. Staff was very friendly and welcoming.,May 10| 2017,5
The hotel is excellent. Great room| clean and spacious. However we ordered a grilled cheese for our kid and we were charged $35. No joke| and it wasn't even good| he wouldn't eat it. So I recommend the hotel but not the food.,Apr 29| 2017,5
Excelent ubication| services| confort,Apr 24| 2017,5
HOTEL WAS VERY NICE STAFF WERE SO FRIENDLY AND COURTEOUS,Apr 24| 2017,5
Hotel décor was good| staff friendly and location superb| but not many facilities such a gym| or we didn't know about it,Apr 15| 2017,4
The room was very clean | staff was very polite| in a perfect spot for what we had planed in the city to and from manhatten and one of our favorite restaurants in Brooklyn The Smoke Joint,Apr 13| 2017,5
A very fine hotel| good check-in| quick elevator| nice enough room--only drawback are $$$$.  The place is overpriced| in an overpricey market of course| and breakfast and add-ons (such as parking) drive the price beyond acceptable.  Live and learn.,Apr 12| 2017,4
The staff was very courteous. The hotel was clean and very modern,Apr 9| 2017,5
This hotel was nice and clean. The staff is very friendly and overnight front desk attendant was always helpful. Be sure to check out the hotel bar and restaurant. I would stay here again and recommend this hotel to anyone.,Apr 7| 2017,5
Elegantly refurbished with Brooklyn theme.  Good food in restaurant (and not outrageously expensive).  Good location| fairly close to subway and Barclays Center.  Nice small hotel.  Will return.,Apr 4| 2017,4
The room was a good size and the beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was a little small| but adequate. I would have preferred a stall shower| but the tub and curtain surrounding it were very clean.,Apr 3| 2017,5
wanted to surprise my husband with a relaxing night out didn't want to go into the city ..so I found this amazing hotel. it was so clean everything was perfect staff was really pleasant and great. The room was so comfortable and  inviting . I plan on staying here again,Apr 2| 2017,5
Staff were very friendly and helpful.  Tub didn't drain well and there was construction otherwise a great stay. Would stay again.,Apr 2| 2017,5
They gave us a messy| didn't clean room (there are tip left from the last customer) to us. And change to another room| I asked them why the fan in bathroom was broken| not and noise. They said their furniture is so silence... actually it wasn't work at all. They said they can provide free snacks for the convenience.,Mar 29| 2017,1
It's only been open 3-4 months. Sasha (I forget the names of the other front desk staff) were phenomenal. Felix| engineering and all around fix it guy| also excellent| friendly| great attitude| made us feel like royalty. The room/bathroom size was adequate but the bed| a bit on the firm side for me| the pillows| way too soft| housekeeping did an amazing job to keep it super clean and stocked with towels and toiletries. We traveled to NY to unfortunately bury my mother and put up her headstone etc. and the evening before checkout I asked a gentleman at the front desk for a late checkout on a Monday and he had authority to extend from 12:00 to 1:00 and added that we'd need to discuss with the on duty manager who gets in at 9:00am. When I asked what it might cost to extend it from 1:00 to around 6:00 (our flight home wasn't leaving till after 10:00pm and we were exhausted from the many trials and tribulations it took for the funeral etc| to which he expressed his condolences and said he wasn't sure but perhaps $75.00 to maybe half day room rate). We called the next morning and the manager was not only not compassionate to our plight but very straight forward and said to extend the 4 hours would be a full days rate| didn't express anything for my loss and my wife explained what front desk told us the night before| he didn't care and said that info was wrong and that housekeeping leaves at 4:00pm. Heartless in my opinion|could be cleaned Monday. We won't be using Hilton again.,Mar 28| 2017,5
Was good except the dining room does not serve any food after 9:30 am for breakfast during the week.  We had to go elsewhere.  The front desk does not provide cash.  In an unfamiliar place this is very uncomfortable for elderly women.  We were pointed out to nearest ATM.,Mar 27| 2017,4
2nd Stay at this hotel.  1st was perfect.  2nd time there was a problem with the fridge.  It had not been cleaned and the previous guest's food remained.  Told the front desk.  Left the room.  When I returned| the fridge had still not been cleaned.  Staff cleaned on second request.  Otherwise everything was good.  Would have appreciated being comped something| but the hotel didn't offer anything.,Mar 27| 2017,4
Overall my stay was great the only thing is when my husband and I ordered room service the food was cold.,Mar 24| 2017,5
The area is developing so you have several of the high street shops. Very close to Brooklyn Tabernacle church| Barclays Centre and trains. One great aspect is hotel provides Netflix!,Mar 21| 2017,4
Stay was great great location parking was shaky,Mar 21| 2017,4
Very nice stay!,Mar 14| 2017,5
We had a wonderful stay at the Hilton. Everything was convenient and clean. My only comment was that the breakfast left a little to be desired.,Mar 8| 2017,5
Came into Brooklyn to visit family.  Neighborhood was exactly where I wanted to be and the hotel was safe and room noise level excellent (i.e. quiet) for this area.  Lobby area/bar was funky.  There was some confusion at check-in (computer did not appear to be updated with room availability)| but Front Desk personnel were courteous and helpful throughout.  The hotel is new so it is in very good shape| but the bathroom in my room could have been a bit cleaner - was wiped down| rather than scrubbed clean.  Would definitely stay again on a future trip.,Mar 6| 2017,4
Lovely hotel overrall| but my evening was disrubted by loud yelling and screaming for 15min. Which continues on and i had to call security,Mar 6| 2017,4
Your lovely hotel added to the enjoyment of the trip. Have recommended it to others.,Mar 3| 2017,5
nice| new hotel in convenient location| would definitely come back again!,Mar 3| 2017,5
Affordable for the quality. Unscheduled construction right above my head at all hours.,Feb 26| 2017,4
Spacious| clean room and close to several major subway lines made our stay very enjoyable. Staff was also very nice and professional. Would come back again!,Feb 24| 2017,5
Great sized room| modern| clean| accessible to a Metro stop. I truly enjoyed my stay at Hilton Brooklyn. In addition the staff was very helpful and professional!,Feb 23| 2017,5
Great stay| great location,Feb 21| 2017,4
Good| clean hotel| staff were friendly but not always observant to the little touches| especially in replenishing of housekeeping items. Otherwise good stay in this hotel. Breakfast was expensive.,Feb 15| 2017,4
Everything was very clean. The place looks brand new and is beautiful. The staff was very friendly and even suggested near by places to go. I would highly recommend a stay here for anyone visiting Brooklyn or going to an event at the Barclay's Center,Feb 13| 2017,5
Much cleaner then I expected| the staff was friendly and made my experience one I will never forget.  Ill be back !,Feb 6| 2017,5
I Really Enjoyed My Stay At The Hiltons.,Jan 31| 2017,5
First they mixed up my room ! Then it was a mouse in my room. I called manager and they offered to move me but I left the hotel then they gave me the run around about getting my money back still haven't got it back yet ! I stayed in room 328,Jan 24| 2017,1
I was staying in Brooklyn to be close to a job. The other hotels were booked and Hilton had a great rate for the two nights. Very comfy bed!,Jan 21| 2017,5
The room did not have a bathtub. I thought it advertised one.,Jan 16| 2017,5
It was OK. No TV remote in room.  Someone vacuuming the rug outside our room at 10:00 at night.,Jan 16| 2017,3
Very good front desk staff.. friendly and helpful!,Jan 16| 2017,5
The staff was pleasant and helpful| housekeeping did a great job. Special mention must be maid of Mr Emory at the Reception| and Ms. Anna of Housekeeping. Other staff members were also very attentive| restaurant staff as well.Keep up the good work| and may you prosper continually.,Jan 13| 2017,4
I will go back here. It was awesome. The only thing I didn't like was the time the housekeepers took to clean.,Jan 8| 2017,4
Great staff| easy check in/out . Clean comfy room nice bathroom.,Jan 7| 2017,5
I think this hotel is so good because my room was clean and comfortable. Also| Hilton's staffs were very kind and had good service. This hotel's bed and pillows are great. Subway station is very closed to this hotel| so you guys can go to everywhere directly.  Brooklyn is so beautiful and historic| and Brooklyn has many  pretty nice restaurants and good cafe. However| I had no meal| so I don't know about breakfast. It smells so good.  You should stay here. And you will be good trip because of this hotel.,Jan 7| 2017,5
The hotel has just opened. It's pretty basic but functional. Some things didn't work and the materials seemed cheap. Still| the staff was good and positive| the location is convenient| and the room reasonably comfortable.,Jan 2| 2017,3
Brand new hotel opened for three weeks and located in the heart of downtown. Only con is parking its hard to find and can cost $30 a night.,Jan 2| 2017,5
It was perfect :-),Dec 28| 2016,5
The hotel is very well located| in a walking distance to the Brooklyn Bridge. The hotel is pretty new and the rooms are spacious. Great that the room has a big TV where you can watch Youtube videos.,Dec 20| 2016,4
Super close to the metro stop and Shake Shack :) The front desk people were delightful. The bed was soooo warm and cozy| and  the towels were so plush.,Dec 19| 2016,5
Brand new facility - just opened this week.  Everything is clean| new| and comfortable.  Area is undergoing redevelopment with nearby shopping| diner| subway and bus transportation.,Dec 14| 2016,5
I had a reservation and was supposed to check in by 3pm. They said they were sold out and would call me when my room was ready. They didn't call me till almost 8pm! We asked for some compensation for the late check in and they said they couldn't do anything. That's poor customer service.,Dec 13| 2016,3
great,Dec 11| 2016,5

전반적으로 만족스러우나 난방기 팬소리가 너무커서 잘 때는 끄고 자야 했고 샤워기를 틀때 온도조절 후 틀수가 없어서 처음에는 찬물을 맞아야 함. 무료 Wi-Fi가 제공되지만 좀 느림,Jan 20| 2019,4

Lage des Hotels super für Brooklyn (Nähe Boerum/Cobble Hill| Carroll Gardens mit netten Restaurants/Bars/Take outs - etwas günstiger als in Manhatten). Gleichzeitig auch sehr nahe an Manhattan (mit Subways A| C| F) oder zu Fuß über Brooklyn Bridge nach Downtown. Sehr gut auch zur Brooklyn Heights Promenade bzw. Brooklyn Bridge Park gelegen. Hotel an sich wie für ein Hilton zu erwarten sehr guter Standard. Eine hervorragende Alternative zu den Hotels in Manhattan. Und günstiger zu JFK (direkter Anschluss mit A train nach Howard Beach/Air train).,Sep 4| 2018,5

God service i receptionen. Men værelset var ikke super hyggeligt og var tydeligvis et dobbelt værelse hvor man bare havde låst døren. Det gjorde at der var meget lydt.,Aug 12| 2018,3
Flott ferie og opphold i Brooklyn NY. Flott hotell med store rom og fin beliggenhet midt i Brooklyn Heights. Kort vei til Subway| samt gå avstand til Brooklyn Bridge. Anbefaler å bo i Brooklyn å få med seg det rolige og hippe liv i lokalområdet. Anbefales for familieferie.,Aug 4| 2018,5
L'hôtel est bien situé| à proximité de plusieurs stations de métro et les chambres sont correctes. L'accueil est agréable. En revanche||j'ai passé 8 nuits dans cet hôtel| et selon les jours : les serviettes n'avaient pas été changées| le plateau du petit déjeuner était toujours dans ma chambre à mon retour le soir| un produit d'entretien avait été oublié dans la chambre| les nouveaux draps étaient tâchés. Le dernier jour j'avais commandé le petit déjeuner dans la chambre entre 8h30 et 9h et j'ai eu le tort de ne pas me réveiller à temps : à 8h40| j'ai été réveillée par les coups violents portés sur la porte par l'employé de l'hôtel| qui trouvant que je ne réagissait pas assez vite| a utilisé son passe pour entrer dans la chambre ! Inacceptable.J'ajoute que la climatisation est extrêmement bruyante.,Jun 3| 2018,2
Voyage en famille avec nos 3 enfants pendant les vacances de printemps. Très bon hôtel. Métro à proximité pour rejoindre Manhattan. Commerces et restaurants proches. Très bonne literie et surtout très bien insonorisé!,May 16| 2018,5
Helt greit hotell| men treg innsjekking og sviltende service ved innsjekking. Minimalt med info om rom| aircondition og andre tilbud på hotellet. Mitt overordnete inntrykk er middelmådig| et hotell med fine rom| lite sjel.,Apr 4| 2018,3

Hotel muito bom.  Quarto bom. Excelente banheiro. Localização é maravilhosa. Próximo do metrô| próximo de bons restaurantes e lanchonetes e por estar no Brooklyn não tem a lotação e espera de atendimento como tem emManhattan. A única coisa é que o café da manhã e muito caro (US$ 30|00 por pessoa),Jan 5| 2018,4

Doubletree bumped us to Hotel Central New York South and it was the worst experience ever| no house keeping| I had to call the lobby and ask to have someone come get the trash and I had to call to ask for toilet paper and fresh towels. The shower door didn’t close correctly the sink faucet spritzed everywhere| there was no complimentary bottle water the ice machine didn’t work| and the area was not very nice at all| I would not recommend this place even to my worse enemy,May 22| 2021,1
I really enjoyed my stay. Will recommend to others. Customer service very friendly.,Mar 29| 2021,4
Could not use our reservation due COVID and could not cancel AND lost our Reward Night. Very disappointing.,Dec 22| 2020,2
I made a reservation at the Double Tree. When I showed up| I was informed that it was turned into a shelter due to covid.  No one informed me of this in advance. My reservation was moved to another hotel with no heads up at all.,Dec 7| 2020,1
Clean property| needs snack vending machines and food service,May 4| 2020,5
Good hotel overall. Service staff were super helpful and polite. Linens were clean. The only issue I had with the room was the bad mildewy or moldy smell from heating/cooling unit whenever the fan was on| and the strong mold smell in bathroom so I left the fan on all day. Down pillows also had strong smell. Not for the allergic.,Mar 29| 2020,4
Wonderful stay. Breakfast is okay but all stead were nice.,Mar 14| 2020,5
Terrible smoke smell. No shampoo or soap. No toilet power holder. Had 2 rooms and both had extremely inconsistent maid service. Not up to Hilton standards really disappointed.,Mar 13| 2020,1
The bathroom pipes were clogged all the time! It was uncomfortable when it comes to share your stay with some friends.,Mar 10| 2020,4
Staff and service goes above and beyond. Would recommend this hotel.,Mar 7| 2020,5
Great experience|  will travel here again,Mar 6| 2020,4
It had a nice restaurant but was cramped in size and nothing really special. Rooms are very small and bathrooms are inadequate. The closet was not a closet and clothes could not be hung.,Mar 3| 2020,3
Easy check in| check out.  Friendly| helpful staff. Room on the small side for a 6 night break. No room for suitcases. Good area with easy transport links to enjoy Manhattan.,Mar 3| 2020,4
Elevetor doors are v noise upon opening and closing,Mar 3| 2020,4
Well the only thing I had was a problem with check in time. It was 4 pm and I arrived 10am... I asked for early check in hoping to be in by 3pm but I was never called... I guess they don’t have to accommodate me but it would have been nice to not have to rush to get ready for my 5 pm event...,Mar 3| 2020,4
Lovely staff who are very helpful.Hotel is tired and dull| rooms are small. Don’t expect the same standards as you get at a Double Tree in the Uk.,Feb 28| 2020,3
Super friendly staff| hotel was very clean| rooms are extremely small and only having two elevators means you are waiting/ stopping on multiple floors every ride.,Feb 21| 2020,4
In addition to the room being fairly spacious - considering the location| it was science-lab clean| and the staff were phenomenal. They were super efficient responding to requests and very friendly.,Feb 19| 2020,5
The hotel is run down and the elevators break down.  Although the staff was nice| not very knowledgeable.  I needed a safety pin and asked for a sewing kit.  The staff advised it did not come with one and I should go to Duane Reade.  I asked for one anyway and found one in the sewing kit.,Feb 17| 2020,1
The location is amazing for a first time stay in New York. It’s close to every cool tourist spot but there are also 100’s of other hotels around the same area. The elevators are super tiny here| but I imagine most of NY to have tiny rooms and facilities. The rooms definitely need to be refurbished as some of the stuff were damaged and unsightly| but the bed was comfy. Overall| it was an OK stay.,Feb 17| 2020,3
Clean and comfy and a great rate. We have been coming for decades. Seems as they are cutting corners little by little| our room was looking slightly ragged.,Feb 12| 2020,4
Great location.  For New York| very reasonably priced.,Feb 4| 2020,4
The shower curtain in room was damaged water was all over the floor due to the shower curtain. New cleaning lady never left new toiletries even after they were requested.,Feb 3| 2020,3
location was great. My room was dirty| meaning there was someone else's Q-tip laying on the bathroom floor,Feb 3| 2020,3
Very nice. Room on the small side but had everything new needed,Jan 29| 2020,4
Staff extremely helpful and always offering free snacks and basic beverages.,Jan 27| 2020,4
They made me wait to get my room even that I got there at 5pm and usually the rooms should be available by 3pm. That was the only inconvenience. I wait for more than 30 minutes,Jan 22| 2020,4
as the best room for the money an the staff was excellent. It's not the most high-end hotel| but you'll get more for your money here than anywhere else I've stayed in NYC. Definitely reccomend it!,Jan 21| 2020,5
Clean and friendly; showers leave lots of room for improvement.,Jan 21| 2020,4
Very nice place and staff. Bar tender was amazing she talked with us and was very sweet and good at her job,Jan 21| 2020,5
Good location| close to Maison Kayser| Ess-a- bagel| subway station!,Jan 21| 2020,4
A reasonably priced room in NY.  Main complaint was that the elevators were slow.  Too many floors for only two cars.  Room was ready for early check-in| so that was a plus.  Room itself - I got a low floor| right next to the elevator| probably because I booked on Expedia - was predictably small.  Closet/armoire had a full size ironing board wedged into it.  Not a lot of room for much else.  Did not locate the ice bucket until checkout.  Bathroom also small| but that's to be expected.  No alarm clock| but there's an app for that.  If all you need's a bed for the night| and you're not looking for an experience| this place is fine.,Jan 20| 2020,3
Had made reseveration thru Hotels.comType of room was not available. Had been put in a double bed room for 4 nights. Spent over 2 hours on the phone with hotels.com just got so frustrated. So much for sliver service from Hotels.com. It was a joke...,Jan 16| 2020,2
Very nice hotel. Clean| good sized room! (especially for a hotel in Manhattan!) When I was checking in| the front desk person was very nice and helpful. They also offered late checkout. The breakfast was delicious. I didn't realize the breakfast buffet closed at 10am| I got there at like 10:45. I was kind of disappointed by that| but the food you could order on the menu was great. Also the cookies they give you at the front desk is very good. Only thing that bothered me is during the night the hallway smelled like a strong smell of cigarette smoke. But I think that was another guest smoking. The hotel has signs in the rooms that say smoking is not allowed. It's in a great location. Right near Herald Square Macy's and all the subways/PATH trains. Very short walk to Times Square and all the main attractions. Also Chelsea is a very nice neighborhood in general| so the hotel is along a nice street. I will definitely be staying here again next time I need a hotel in NYC!,Jan 16| 2020,5
Tiny rooms| kind of run down hotel| but clean and good service. The breakfast is not worth the price| it would be expensive at half the price,Jan 14| 2020,4
This hotel had problems with validation with Hotel.com took over and hour to check in and I am concerned about being charged twice,Jan 14| 2020,3
Horrible experience. The hotel is tiny. The elevators are slow. The world are inexperienced and in knowledgeable. Room had two beds and only one bed would get made. Just terrible!!!!,Jan 6| 2020,3
What I didn’t like about the property is that it’s old it’s very outdated it didn’t look the way it does online. The pictures online look way nicer than in person. Taking a shower was a little difficult because there’s just a glass there which didn’t make any sense | it wasn’t even a sliding door.,Jan 6| 2020,2
Very pleasant staff. Free coffee and newspapers in the morning a nice touch.,Jan 5| 2020,5
Good location close to subway and shops. Clean facility and very helpful and friendly staff.,Jan 5| 2020,5
Great location staying at this hotel| close to the subway and easy to get an Uber/taxi. Approx 15 minute walk from empire state building and only 10 minutes from madison square garden. Great restaurants located nearby and very convenient location. Staff are excellent and helpful! You can request mineral water for free at the check in desk each day. The rooms are ok| very outdated and the cleanliness was ok - found dust around the room on our first day when we checked in. The lifts are appalling| there are about 27 floors in this hotel and only 2 lifts that skip the bottom floors. We were on the 4th floor and just took the stairs down each time as we gave up waiting for the lift. Apart from that| all was ok! Decent for the price paid and location.,Jan 4| 2020,4
Conveniently located to Penn Station| Madison Square Garden| Macy’s and not far from Times Square..,Jan 4| 2020,5
Good location and value. Rooms were small for 4 people. Service was great. 2 elevators were not enough for all the guests.,Dec 30| 2019,4
Great location and the staff we interacted with were extremely helpful and friendly. Overall a fairly nice place| however the carpet in the common hallway on our floor (5th) was filthy. Looked like it hadn't been vacuumed or cleaned in some time. Our room's carpet was fine| albeit a little dated. So overall not that big of a deal| but it was hard not to notice as it's the first thing you see when you step off the elevator.,Dec 30| 2019,4
1. Great location 2. Unfriendly and not helpful staff3. Very long waiting time for an elevator 4. Small lobby (huge traffic area in a very limited space)5. Very tiny rooms| no space for suitcases| no place to sit down)6. Room service is not regular (no cleaning at times)7. The cleaning is partial (garbage is not removed| bedding is ok)8. Tv 📺 is not working9. No coffee machine| no cups,Dec 30| 2019,2
The room was terrible handles on closet were broken bathroom door was difficult to open. The bathroom shower was it seems made for handicap and water would end up all over bathroom floor| shower head was difficult to adjust. Mattress was extremely soft and we would sink to the center.,Dec 29| 2019,1
The staff was always ready to help and made my xmas holiday sparkle!!,Dec 27| 2019,5
Great location and fairly quiet. Staff were accomodating and professional. The building and rooms are definitely a bit old and rundown,Dec 26| 2019,4
It was a very small room| but it’s NYC. Overall cleanliness was good but when we arrived they had forgotten to clean the bathroom and shower so we had to call about that. The two elevators were very slow and really couldn’t accommodate the amount of guests and workers that use them. (They don’t have a service elevator). The people that work there were very nice. Overal I’d give it an 8/ 10. The double beds were just too small too.,Dec 24| 2019,4
Always a smiling face and greeting at an hour of the day or night.,Dec 24| 2019,5
Nothing to brag about. Hotel is old and not clean.,Dec 23| 2019,2
The property was pretty close to the middle of everywhere I was planning to go.,Dec 23| 2019,4
Heating very poorly regulated. Automatic heating not working. Was very hot till AM,Dec 21| 2019,4
The hotel is older| but clean  and the beds were really nice. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The only negative was the lobby. It is quite small with very little seating. Overall I definitely would stay here again.,Dec 21| 2019,4
The location is good. Easy to get to Time Square| and other parts of Manhattan .The beds were excellent| and the room very clean.,Dec 19| 2019,4
I felt that the rooms need to be updated. The carpet was stained and the chair needed to replaced.,Dec 18| 2019,4
The staff was so lovely... very friendly and helpful... room service which is sometimes delivered as an afterthought... was excellent!Thank you.  I would recommend this hotel... Chelsea| close to Union Square| Times Square and a walk to Penn Station!!,Dec 15| 2019,5
Security knocking on my door in the middle of the night to perform a "Room Audit "?,Dec 11| 2019,4
We had a quick trip in and out and didn’t even venture into the restaurant. But| the staff was super kind and accommodating.,Dec 10| 2019,5
Location is great.   5 minutes walk from Penn Station.   The hotel is very small and old but the room and amenities were very nice.  Great shower|The best thing was the price!!!!    I can give up fancy lobby and oversized rooms to save substantial amount of money,Dec 10| 2019,4
I have stayed at a Double Tree Hilton in London| which was wonderful| and we have a Double Tree here in Key West| which is also wonderful.  This is why I booked the Double Tree in New York.  However I was extremely disappointed.  The room and the hallways were shabby| the duvets did not have covers and were just placed between 2 sheets - yuck.  My son had bed bug bites.  I saved my money for this trip| and expected more for $400 a night!  Very disappointed.,Dec 9| 2019,2
Good location| clean room| friendly staff| all that I would expect. If this room were a parking space| it would be very hard to park without getting a scratch or dent. But fortunately it’s not| so no problem.,Dec 9| 2019,4
It was Ok overall,Dec 6| 2019,4
Only problem was that we waited an hour for our towels,Dec 6| 2019,4
Location was great. Lobby comfort was so-so| and bar area closes at 11pm| so there is really no place to relax after that. Rooms are worn and in need of refresh. Garbage stacked in the stairwells.,Dec 6| 2019,3
Nice place| don’t get me wrong could be doing with a lick of paint but otherwise fine. Yes the lifts are busy but you get there eventually and they’re pretty fast. Would easily stay again! Some people just have Farr to high standards| in terms of a room in New York City this was massive.,Dec 4| 2019,4
The hotel is centrally located and is kept clean.  The bed was comfortable.  There was only 1 elevator working the day I stayed which was an inconvenience.  The hotel needs an upgrade.  It is dated.  It’s a decent place to stay but don’t expect any luxury.,Dec 4| 2019,3
Very good will be back,Dec 3| 2019,5
Elevator broken. Had to walk 14 flights of steps to check out.,Dec 3| 2019,3
We picked this hotel because it is very convenient to penn station| but we weren’t very happy with it. The front sitting area and entrance had construction barriers and bags of garbage piled up. There is almost no lobby at all so no place to sit or even stand when you are waiting to meet people. The whole place was a little dingy and sad. We will definitely try a different place next time,Dec 1| 2019,3
Good location. Friendly staff. Would have been nice to have a more relaxed bar area.,Dec 1| 2019,4
The hotel is 3 blocks from Penn Station and around the corner from a subway stop.  The view of the Empire State Building from the window was great.  The 2 bed room was small but good for a weekend.,Nov 29| 2019,4
The staff was very courteous and friendly.  Upon arrival| was greeted with warm chocolate peanut butter cookies.  Very small room and cozy bed.  The carpet is very dated but overall| I enjoyed my stay.  The upper floor rooms is were the view of the Empire State Building.  The location was great.  The hotel is close to the police dept| Metro train| Empire State Buliding| Madison Square Garden| The Wendy Williams and Rachel Ray Show.  Plenty of restaurants and galleries.  Only problem was self parking| which is on the other side of the hotel.  Two night stay... Arrived late| around 8 pm.  Parking was discounted at $33 per 24 hrs stay.   I was charged full price on the last day| after leaving early.  Plus if you leave out of the parking garage| the Parking garage will recharge you an additional $33 to park.    Other than that| I will stay at this hotel agsin.,Nov 27| 2019,5
On the phone they told me it included breakfast.  false.  The bathroom was not very clean.  The fan sounded too hard that I couldn't sleep.  damage to the bathroom mirror that makes it look bad.  And many other things.,Nov 26| 2019,1
The hotel was clean and comfortable.  As most New York rooms are| it was small.  The staff was super friendly.  It was great for a family of 4 weekend getaway.,Nov 25| 2019,5
The hotel is at a great location| close to Penn Station and other subway lines running up and down town. The staff were friendly in check in| and again when we checked out as they held our luggage for us (free of charge| some in NYC charge you for that privilege). The rooms were clean and beds comfy.The rooms are the smallest I have stayed in NYC| and as a family of 4 it was a tight squeeze with everyone and the luggage. The hotel has two elevators servicing all floors. While we were there one was out for maintenance| then the next day both elevators stopped working. The stairs to rooms were only accessible by a door from the outside| and walking 19 flights of stairs at 10pm wasn’t a highlight. Fingers crossed the elevators are fixed. I would stay here again| but not with a family as the rooms are too small to accommodate that comfortably.,Nov 25| 2019,3
The stay was terrible! The pictures are inaccurate. The hotel needs MAJOR maintenance. The elevators were out almost the entire stay. I had to walk 22 flights of stairs most mornings. The heat in our room did not work and maintenance could not fix it but did not move us rooms. This was an awful experience!,Nov 25| 2019,1
I was SO disappointed with this hotel. Its a Doubetree for heavens sake!! The night I arrived there was only 1 elevator working making it a long wait for a 27 story hotel. No service elevator. Next day| STILL only 1 elevator working. Third day I got back to the hotel at 10:00 pm after diner with friends and BOTH ELEVATORS were not working. There were so many people just sitting in the lobby waiting while staff kept saying it shouldn't be much longer. Then they offered us A drink in the bar - 1 drink. Then people started walking up the stairs. I am in my 60's with a bad leg but after 1 hour and 30 minutes of waiting I WALKED UP 10 STORIES!! Total B.S. Wait - it gets better!!! When I got into bed the first night I felt like I was getting bit. I turned on the lights and looked at my sheets and YES - BEDBUGS!!!! I asked for a different room and they said they didn't have another room. I slept in my clothes for 3 days with the lights on. Let me say this - the front desk people were very nice and tried to do something but there really wasn't anything they could do. I couldn't move from the hotel as I pre-paid in advance (never again). VERY rarely do I really leave a review but this time I have to. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL. Small rooms| elevators may/may not work| BEDBUGS| large dry cleaning bill when you get home to try to kill anything that came home with me!!!,Nov 25| 2019,1
Great stay at a reasonable price.The hotel is in renovation| so it will look great in the future.,Nov 24| 2019,5
Minimally nice.  Looks worn and needs updating| and space was small| but clean.  Not meant for you to spend a lot of time in the room| which is fine for NY! 😊,Nov 23| 2019,4
Every single staff member we interacted with was friendly and super helpful! The room was clean| neat and modern and the drawer of warm cookies is to die for!!!!,Nov 22| 2019,5
Overall| the hotel didn't seem to reflect the quality that I've experienced in the past with Doubletree.  With the Doubletree brand| I expect higher quality versus other hotels.  At this location| the service was strong and professional.  The lobby was very dated and small| with no real sense of presence.  The rooms (including bathrooms) were small for a Doubletree even in NYC.,Nov 21| 2019,2
Service was terrible.  Upon arrival the front desk clerk did paperwork and ignored me for at least 10 minutes before checking me in.  Coffee in the morning is complimentary and when leaving the front desk charged me extra for coffee.  Don’t mind paying for coffee but not when it’s supposed to be complimentary.  The front desk and manager argued with me when I brought it to their attention and actually accused me of eating breakfast there| which never happened. Will never go there again!,Nov 20| 2019,1
Easy to get in and out. Excelent| responsive and friendly staff.,Nov 19| 2019,5
The rooms are dated and small. Bed feels old and indented. Just my luck that I ran into their construction outside as well. There were debris and dust everywhere. It was loud. But super convenient location,Nov 16| 2019,3
Did not like all concrete busted up in front of door. Also was luggage everywhere around lobby.,Nov 13| 2019,5
Terrible. Only two elevators and one was out of order. Our sheets had rips in them and the duvet cover would not stay on the comforter- gross! Had construction RIGHT outside our window which woke us up each day. The staff was short.,Nov 12| 2019,1
We have stayed here before. Looks like there is construction going on in front of the hotel.,Nov 10| 2019,4
We were in NY for a wedding and the staff| for the most part| was very friendly I have to give a shout out to Eve in Sales for her patience and helpAlso Darlene at the front desk was very helpfulworst part was the elevator system but it was tolerableLOVED THE WARM COOKIES!!!!!,Nov 6| 2019,4
Great location| nice staff| good clean room but small good for NYC,Nov 5| 2019,4
Needs complete renovation| not living up to the Hilton name. Dusty carpet in bedroom showing neglect| limo way too soft mattresses. Welol warn common halls. Friendly kind staff.,Nov 3| 2019,3
Great say enjoyed the hotel significantly,Oct 29| 2019,5
Location! That was the main reason.The welcoming cookies are a nice touch.I didn’t like the price| but everything in or around midtown was expensive when I picked this one.Carpets are old| but not the end of the world,Oct 22| 2019,4
A very nice hotel,Oct 20| 2019,4
weekend visit| htel close t Penn. Station which is excellent. Hotel staff excellent they were all Very nice and helpful . There was free coffee in the morning but breakfast buffet was $22.95||||a bit pricey - I just want something to have with my coffee like a muffin.,Oct 18| 2019,4
Made the reservation months in advance for a suite 5 nights First night we stayed in a single room with two regular beds not very comfortable we did not check into our suite until 3:30 the next day disappointed,Oct 15| 2019,2
Checkin was quick although initially we were given 2 doubles when king was specifically requested at booking. Staff switched room| after holding on for 10 minutes.,Oct 11| 2019,4
It was a convenient and very nice hotel,Oct 10| 2019,4
Location is good and the service was great. Would stay here again,Oct 9| 2019,4
Great staff. Great room| comfy bed,Oct 5| 2019,5
the staffs are quite polite and friendly. but the physical interiors suffer some| especially the corridor is really narrow| and no soundproofing fitout| just guessing,Oct 3| 2019,4
Great location. Staff was nice. We asked about checking in early which they were not able to accommodate but they were able to hold our bags for a few hours until check in. Overall good experience.,Oct 3| 2019,4
Location and clean! Quick and friendly service in front desk.,Oct 1| 2019,5
Very convenient midtown location. Room size was good| king bed| decent sized bathroom. Love the warm cookies & free bottled water available at the front desk! Only 2 elevators so sometimes you have to wait| but we were on the third floor so could take the stairs in a pinch. There were a few minor condition issues| like the bathroom sink was not flush with the marble counter cutout| but overall it was clean and comfortable.,Sep 24| 2019,5
I didn’t like how I booked a room that was stated view of the Empire State Building I did not have that and I am not sure if the hotel even had the view of it But I def don’t want to pay more and then not get the room u pay for,Sep 22| 2019,4
The room was tiny| even by New York standards.  The hallways were narrow. The neighborhood is dirty and smelly.,Sep 17| 2019,2
This happens to be one of my favorite Hotels. I love the rooms| bed| locations and the Main Attraction of All Their Delicious Cookies 🍪...,Sep 16| 2019,5
The location is really good. Check in was friendly and efficient - the welcome cookie may have swayed my judgement on this. Room was fine. Comfy bed and reasonable shower. One of the reasons we booked was no add ons for internet or “resort fees”.,Sep 10| 2019,4
Staff was outstanding.   The reception was horrible for cell coverage and the WiFi kept going out as well.   Hard to conduct business there.,Sep 5| 2019,3
There was no hotel room for us when we arrived. We were given a key to a room| tried to open the door| eventually found that it was already occupied when someone made noise inside the room. 1.5 hours later we were moved to another hotel. I had to pay for the taxis there and back myself| but was refunded in the morning. It was Friday night| I asked if they would refund us for the night. They said no - that they had already done enough by comping us,Sep 3| 2019,1
This hotel is nothing at all as described in the pictures and Definitely not a 4 Star Hotel. It’s a run down mess. The bathtub was so worn out that several layers of ceramic and rust were coming through. This is unhealthy. The curtains were ripped. The carpeting was filthy. In the advertisement there’s a pic if NYC from a room. I would like to know which room as we were on the 12th floor and out our window was an old office building. Once again| the pictures are lovely and misrepresentative of the actual hotel. The staff is nice but it’s not their fault. What a joke to try and have this as a four star. I would give it no stars.,Sep 3| 2019,1
Good location and comfortable. Staff helpful & good cookies!,Sep 2| 2019,4
Property is dated.  I stayed in the penthouse and the view was amazing on the outside.  However| the pealing wall paper and obvious cracks in the ceiling were quite unsightly.,Aug 27| 2019,3
The room was fine.  The tv only got about 3 channels| none of the networks so I couldn't watch news in the morning.  Since I wasn't there to watch tv| not a huge deal| but something that shouldn't be an issue you have to deal with.,Aug 26| 2019,3
Pretty nice| good price| helpful staff and| specially| localization!,Aug 25| 2019,5
I loved the staff and my room was wonderful! The location is one of the best and always cold water waiting for you in the lobby.,Aug 21| 2019,5
The room had a musty smell. It was very small. There were hairs from someone else everywhere. The carpet needed to be shampooed in the room and hallway. Overall| place was not overly clean. Staff was pleasant and helpful.,Aug 21| 2019,3
EVERYTHING is smaller than you would expect. The room| the hallways and the beds. I’m 6’2” and my feet were hanging off of the bed. There was also something wrong with the towel service that weekend| and it took forever to get fresh towels. One whole day.,Aug 21| 2019,3
I switched to the doubletree after checking in to a horrible hotel nearby. I told them about my reason for checking in and they treated me like a VIP and made me guest of the day...I revived free cookies for my daughter and I and a free buffet voucher as well as a plate of cheeses and fruit sent up to my room free of charge. They were very nice to us. The room was very clean and the beds were extremely comfortable to sleep in. The buffet was also great! Superb hotel.,Aug 21| 2019,5
Location is good| parking is easy with garage across street. Heads up there is a discount but you have to tell the garage ahead of time| we were not aware of this. Hotel staff is very friendly| clean and comfortable.,Aug 19| 2019,4
Bathroom trouble needs a lot of improvement  tiles of stained  and the worst part is High Humidity and bad smell    room carpet dirty and filthy  Blankets are full of stains| I would definitely not recommend to any one this Hotel .,Aug 17| 2019,2
The service from the amazing staff made this a great place to stay!,Aug 14| 2019,5
I searched for 4* and above on Expedia and this hotel appeared on the list| this is not even a 3* hotel. It’s a low end 2* hotel at the best. Expedia should be careful about rating hotel.,Aug 14| 2019,1
People was nice and the breakfast was really good.,Aug 13| 2019,4
Location and price. Cleaning came too early in the morning. No hooks to hang towels.,Aug 12| 2019,4
I want a refund.  The hotel cancelled the reservation and fully charged me.  We never even stsyed there.  Thet said we arrived too late and still fully charged the 2 days.  I had to pay for anither hotel.  Please refund,Aug 12| 2019,1
Great location! Very central to everything. Close to NJ transit station (3 min walk). Close to subway (28th). Walking distance to time square. Not to mention all the great place to eat and get a coffee. Whole foods is like 3 blocks away.,Aug 7| 2019,4
Amazing.,Jul 31| 2019,5
Smelled bad. Could have been cleaner. Adequate for our needs but definitely stayed in better hotels for same cost,Jul 30| 2019,3
Was disappointed in my stay. Overpriced room| very cramped| not clean| and poorly maintained. Was not given any information upon check in (WiFi| accommodations| etc.).,Jul 29| 2019,1
We had a great stay. The room was great for the cost . The staff were exceptional.,Jul 26| 2019,5
Great location. Wonderful staff. We arrived several hours early during the heat wave. After a short wait in the air conditioned lobby with ice water| they checked us in early. The a/c was on in our room when we got there. Heaven! Very comfortable beds.,Jul 23| 2019,5
This was a nice hotel in a good location. Very comfortable bed and room was nice| cool| and clean.,Jul 23| 2019,5
Fantastic location for New York. Service from the staff was excellent. Quite a nice hotel.,Jul 21| 2019,4
The interior is dull and dated with no swim and suana facilities.,Jul 19| 2019,3
Brilliant location| although not the most beatiful streets around the hotel. Nice bedroom with AC| fridge and TV. WiFi was OK. THe breakfast was a bit boring but it was absolutely worth the money.,Jul 18| 2019,4
Rooms to close to others| disturbing guests when others slammed doors. If you are noisy sensitive this is not the best place to stay,Jul 17| 2019,3
Staff - Devin was the best part of this hotel. He was friendly| made good suggestions| always ready to help| great sense of humor| and overall a nice guy. The rest of the staff was just okay. The lady who checked us in wasn’t friendly at first but she was more friendly toward the end of our stay. The night guy Jeremy was rude. He verbally lashed out at my mom for making a simple comment. The restaurant - we waited for our food from 9:10 to 10:30 when it arrived. We had to ask for everything from napkins| silverware| condiments. I felt bad for the poor girl but at the same time some of this should have been on our table. Room - it was small. Which in NY| I can understand. But it had a floating sink| no counter space in the bathroom. We had to strategically places so it would fit. Overall - I stay at different hotels often and usually go with a Hilton brand because you know what to expect. However| this was a less than favorable trip. I will continue to use Hilton because of my other experiences with them but DoubleTree in NY won’t get my vote.,Jul 16| 2019,2
This is a basic hotel in a central New York location. The hotel and rooms are very small.  Staff was nice.  Rooms were comfortable and bathrooms ok.  Staff very nice.  Just keep your expectations simple.,Jul 15| 2019,4
cleanliness| friendliness from staff and location.,Jul 10| 2019,5
Property is in a good location and the staff is very nice.,Jul 10| 2019,5
Good air conditioning| helpful staff. Location okay.,Jul 10| 2019,4
Staff were very helpful but wish they were more friendly on the phone and at the desk.,Jul 9| 2019,3
The front desk clerks were awesome. They helped us with the WiFi and were always attentive. The cleaning staff were extremely friendly. Good location. Comfortable rooms and I loved the pillows and cookies!!,Jul 7| 2019,4
Great location and great staff.Room wasn’t ready till 4 but that is when check in was... but they held our bags so we could go off and explore!,Jul 7| 2019,5
Room too small for a family and floor (with carpet) seemed very dirty. The place is really good| not far from the main attraction even walking and subway very close.,Jul 4| 2019,2
Reliable name and company| comfortable and clean room. Appreciated ease of location and booking. Nothing glamorous or fancy but all was comfortable| easy and clean and the staff was very kind. Would be happy to stay again.,Jul 2| 2019,4
Great location| good value| with only 2 elevators and 26 floors be prepared to wait in the lobby a lot. 22 power points in my room!,Jul 2| 2019,4
strong odor from the air conditioner that gave me a bad head ache| they looked at it and said it was not something they could fix|  Someone had put oil on the coils.  So I just had to deal with it.  Only one elevator worked most of the stay and took for ever to get up and down.,Jul 1| 2019,3
Excellent location! Very friendly staff! Super clean place!,Jun 25| 2019,5
the place was awful. it was very old| dirty. The room was old and carpet dirty. We did not feel comfortable at all. It is the first time I book on expedia and get a terrible hotel.,Jun 25| 2019,1
Terrible overated big elevator problem not safe  Inexperienced staff,Jun 23| 2019,1
Not really good for the price| there was bad smell in the shower curtain and water keeps clogging!,Jun 20| 2019,3
I’ve stayed in cleaner & newer Doubletrees. But this one is convenient. It’s a 5 min walk to the MTA stations or 7 min walk to Penn Station. You can take the MTA to JFK for $2.75. It’s definitely better to stay in this area than in Times Square. You can get to Time Square via MTA in 10 min. Chinatown and its great food in Canal Street is reachable via MTA in 25 min.  From Penn Station| you can take the NJ Line to EWR Airport for $15| or the Long Island RR to Long Island. 2.75. It’s a 7 min walk to a Nordstrom Rack and a 3-5 min walk to reasonably priced eateries & pizza parlors.,Jun 18| 2019,4
Breakfast staff was very friendly and refilled items that needed refilling,Jun 13| 2019,4
The staff were fabulous and accommodating. We wanted convenient location to Penn Station | which it was. The room was average size for NYC | bathroom was small and dark!,Jun 9| 2019,3
The hotel is in a good location and is easily accessible by foot| train or taxi.  The room was clean| modern and comfortable - though not as bright as some of the newer hotels in the area due to the small windows.,Jun 7| 2019,4
I fled another hotel (already paid for) because it was abysmal - (don't EVER stay at Hotel Pennsylvania in NYC.).  BUT| I was fortunate to land at the Doubletree. Staff was amazing| room was clean and comfortable. Price was reasonable. Location great.,Jun 5| 2019,5
We would have liked to have complimentary breakfast considering how much we paid for the room.,Jun 2| 2019,5
My reservation for a king with a top floor view was not available. I was put in a queen room on the 3rd floor next to the elevator.,May 31| 2019,2
The welcoming staffs were very polite and helpful. We were able to check in early which is a plus! Love the complimentary fruit infused water they have daily. My kids really enjoy that esp coming back from a day full of walking and NYC adventures. Our beds were comfy | rooms were small but that to be expected for NYC.  Location is great to all the landmarks we wanted to tour. Not crazy loud like Times Square. We will be back. Thank you!,May 29| 2019,5
Good sleeping beds/ great location loved the personal greeter as I entered the hotel.,May 24| 2019,4
Pros: clean hotel Cons: there are 2 elevators for the whole building. Us being on the 23rd floor| using the stairs wasn’t feasible. During the day house keeping uses it as well as guests. It took us 15 mins to get downstairs once. Word of advise: 10 minutes before you’re ready to head out hit the button!,May 21| 2019,3
Right near FIT and the train station| so the location was perfect for me.  Had to wait until 4 to check in| which is their policy.  Room was nice| clean| everything worked.  Nice little bar in the back that I met friends at a couple of times.  The employees were great.  Ordered room service and it was excellent.  Food was really great!  Here's the one drawback:  THE ELEVATORS.  The staff has to use the same two tiny elevators that the entire 24 floors use.  Every time is a long wait| and around check out it's really bad.  I'd recommend staying on the 10th floor or above so by the time the elevator gets to you| to go down| it's not full.  Easily had to set aside 10 - 15 minutes to get an elevator.  Took longer at check out time.,May 21| 2019,4
One of the elevators was broken so we had to wait a lot for them because by the time it got to us it was full. When checking in the front desk person wasn’t very friendly.,May 21| 2019,3
One more NYC Hotel. Small and expensive. Staff wasn’t that helpful.,May 15| 2019,3
Clean rooms| friendly staff| good location.Important plus was the free parking right outside during weekends. The lobby  is a little cramped and during peak hours you might have to wait for a bit for one of two elevators but that comes with the territory.,May 14| 2019,5
The staff is warm and inviting. The hotel though luxurious and spacious feels cozy and comforting a nice shelter from the city outside,May 14| 2019,4
Not a 4 Star facility. Extremely small room| cramped elevators and dirty carpeting.,May 13| 2019,3
Great locale. Front desk person was awesome. Very comfortable bed quiet,May 12| 2019,5
Only issue with stay was 2 nights in a row we we’re awoken by what sounded like trash trucks that were working for at least 2 hours right outside our room,May 7| 2019,5
I did not like everything at all I did not like everything at all I did not like everything at allI did not like everything at all,Apr 29| 2019,1
The guy at the front desk and other staff were very kind and helpful! Sad thing was the elevator... Make sure to take time when you check out or have an appointment time because it does not come easily and only has tiny space.I felt bad for the house keepers besides us who looked waited so long time.. I was also charged $200 for deposit| $100 when check-in and another $ 100 when check-out. Why? Hope they were just mistakes.,Apr 28| 2019,3
Bar area could have been bigger and elevator was broken. Otherwise nice hotel| close to where my family and I needed to be for our vacation.,Apr 26| 2019,4
Minimal bar area. Breakfast was expensive for a buffet of eggs| bacon | sausage | anf French toast.,Apr 26| 2019,3
Good location| nice staffs| but carpet is not clean. I can't put my luggage on the floor because carpet is not vacuumed and they don't have luggage table. Hope they vacuum good for next guest.,Apr 23| 2019,3
Good location.. accommodating staff. Nice place to stay,Apr 23| 2019,5
Very clean,Apr 19| 2019,5
Great rooms for the price although they are tiny. Very clean. Bar/restaurant is small| we had to find somewhere to eat to fit our party of 7. Staff was excellent.,Apr 16| 2019,4
I attempted to cancel this reservation prior to staying but I was within the cancellation period.  I am truly disappointed at the conditions of this hotel.  The Hilton Chelsea did not meet its expectations.  The check in was good but the rooms are old| smell| and small.  Our first room had dirty linens and smelled so they switched our room... The second room wasn’t as big| but was cleaner.  I will never stay at this property again nor recommend it!,Apr 15| 2019,2
I ENJOYED IT AND THE STAFF WAS VERY PROFESSIONAL,Apr 9| 2019,4
This property is very old. The room condition was quite poorly maintained. Ripped wall paper| stained carpets| the hallways are really worn and dirty| the public bathrooms are disgusting and the smell is horrible| there are only two elevators and you may have to wait 15 minutes for an elevator| the rooms are so tiny you have no where to open luggage (they are all the same as we asked to upgrade and there are only a few studios)| the condition of the ac/heating unit is awful (broken units)| the iron was so damaged that it destroyed my shirt and the bathrooms are so tiny and the door takes up so much space (why isn’t there a sliding door?). Overall there’s not much to like. This hotel needs a major overhaul. Even the lobby is unkept| unwelcoming| and unsightly. For a Hilton property this was really poorly maintained.,Apr 8| 2019,2
The view of the empire state building was excellent. Room were a little small and dirty| you could not go on one side of the bed which left dust up the wall and on the  top of curtains.,Apr 8| 2019,4
I like the location. I also like that I got a cookie upon checking in.,Apr 7| 2019,4
Nice hotel but I did believe the rooms were a little cramped on the small side,Apr 6| 2019,4
Close to Penn Station and a multitude of good eats in the Chelsea area. Quick trip to wait for a connection  all good.,Apr 5| 2019,5
The hotel has only 2 elevators for 27 floors|rooms too small,Apr 3| 2019,3
Cheldine| the receptionist was amazing| kind |nice| very attentive and extremely helpful.For sure if I will need to come back to N.Y |your place will be my first choice.,Apr 2| 2019,5
The hotel was fine| the price paid was okay| the room was not bad| but in other parts of the world| DoubleTree by Hilton can't be called "fine"| "okay"| or "not bad". I guess this is a New York thing. Please name this hotel something else as not to have expectations.,Apr 2| 2019,3
Everyone and everything was great! Location to all the attractions was awesome,Mar 26| 2019,5
Fabulous! The only thing annoying was the elevators| which tended to be consistently overloaded.,Mar 20| 2019,5
Staff...EXCELLENT. But this hotel is soo outdated it’s not even funny.  You can barely fit in the hallways and 2 people absolutely can not fit in the hallway at the same time.  I have never seen carpeting as old and outdated as there’s.   The room? A single room can barely fit a single person.  You have to turn sideways to walk through the room.  You can’t open up your luggage fully unless you’re near the bathroom so that one side can lay in the bathroom and the other side of your luggage is in the room.  I will not be staying there again.,Mar 18| 2019,2
Relatively convenient location within walking distance to East and West sides. Friendly front desk.,Mar 17| 2019,4
I loved my time at Chelsea the house keeping was flexible and it was very clean,Mar 17| 2019,4
Great location for Madison Square Garden which is why we picked the hotel as we were attending a concert. Friendly staff. Good location for Empire State and Macy's all within a short walk. Also very handy for getting to the underground stations. Downside is the hotel is a little tired.,Mar 17| 2019,4
Staff was exceptional!  Very helpful and engaging!,Mar 16| 2019,5
This is a great hotel for the location. They make use of every square inch. For those familiar with the size restrictions a city central hotel might face| the accommodations come as no surprise. I actually found the room to be larger than I expected!There are only two elevators| and one was being repaired when we arrived. This caused quite a bit of delay for anyone trying to go up or down during the few hours the repairs were happening. The staff was super apologetic| and helpful| and also provided some extra points for the inconvenience. I appreciated the extra effort - I know it isn't their fault the elevator needed repairs| so their kindness and support we especially nice.They offered water and warm cookies at check in| the water pressure and temperature were great| and I had plenty to room to spread out both in the room and the bed.The only complaint I have - the tv remote. it couldn't seem to connect to the tv| even when i was standing right in front of it! Eventually I gave up and just used my laptop.,Mar 11| 2019,5
Close to penn station Customer service was great.  Rooms were clean,Mar 10| 2019,5
staff there was not smiling. it looks like they don't know how to smile.,Mar 9| 2019,3
Clean building and friendly staff. Would stay here again.,Mar 4| 2019,4
Great location| near subway and easily walk to many great spots,Mar 3| 2019,5
It's located in downtown close to Madison Square Garden and Korean town. You can travel to anywhere in NYC easily from here because you can walk to subway.,Mar 1| 2019,5
Very good location to explore lower manhattan. One of the front hosts was rude to us however| and we lost 2-3 small items while our rooms were being cleaned.  Otherwise the room was clean| great bed| and amazing location.,Feb 24| 2019,4
Staff and service were fantastic and the location was close to everything we wanted to do.,Feb 24| 2019,5
The hotel was okay. Expensive for what we got. The location of the hotel was very good-less than 0.5mi from NY Penn Station|less than a mile from Times Square|Empire State Building and few other attractions. The room needs some updating-very small for what we paid|kinda old| the iron table was broken and iron box fell almost on me when ironing| the iron box had some burnt stuff on it| asked for a replacement they got us the table alone. They should see the conditions of the equipments before they give the room to a guest. Other than that it was okay.,Feb 21| 2019,4
They give you chocolate chip cookies when you check in. Our room wasn't available when we arrived so they put us in 2 King rooms for 1 night :very nice.,Feb 21| 2019,5
Room wasn't ready until late. They were painting the hallways and I got paint on my clothes. In a really dirty area.,Feb 19| 2019,2
Perfect location very close to principal streets| quiet and lovely staff,Feb 18| 2019,5
Fantastic location| friendly staff. Would definitely start here again in the future.,Feb 17| 2019,5
Great location. Easy check in. Comfortable beds. The staff was very friendly. The rooms were very quiet. The tv was big,Feb 15| 2019,4
Great staff - great location! Close to Penn Station.,Feb 13| 2019,5
The front desk staff were very nice and accommodated our late check out,Feb 12| 2019,4
It was close to Madison Square Garden. It is an older hotel| but it was clean and the staff was friendly. It had a nice New York feel to it.,Feb 12| 2019,5
Everything and everyone was amazing. We were staying in the penthouse and the view was amazing!,Feb 12| 2019,5
Staff were lovely| warm and welcoming| absolutely no complaints about them. The room I was in was very clean (thank you| housekeeping)| but needed to be refurbished. Not sure if any floors in that hotel have been. The shower didn't work properly| the tap was fairly loose and let half the water through| when turning the shower on| which meant little pressure. Feather pillows sound nice| but actually they offer little support| once you've flattened them. Foam pillows would have been better. The heater was noisy every time it kicked in| I had to switch it off for the night| in which case I would've liked a spare blanket. Instead I opted to fold the bed's thin blanket to make it thicker and warmer.,Feb 10| 2019,3
Everyone was extremely pleasant and helpful. The room| though small| was clean and well cared for. Great experience.,Feb 10| 2019,5
Business trip. The room was clean but small and need upgrading.,Feb 9| 2019,4
Hotel itself is excellent. Area it is in kit so excellent,Feb 4| 2019,4
Everything was great from booking| checking in| and even checking out. Was a great experience,Feb 4| 2019,5
Great stay overall! Was in city for business and just needed a simple room| with kind size bed| close to penn station. About a 5 minute walk from penn| quick and easy check-in| and the entire place was clean and easygoing. No hassle any time or where! I even had a great view of Empire State Building (see picture)Only note: Standard rooms are simple and small! Just a bedroom and small bathroom. Perfect for me and my needs but i would not attempt to fit more that 3-4 people in there| and wouldnt sleep more than 2-3 in same bed.,Feb 1| 2019,5
We lovedThe hotel. The views are amazing.,Jan 31| 2019,5
Very good work | enjoyed the  stay and will chose again,Jan 31| 2019,5
The hotel has a good location and the rooms are good,Jan 28| 2019,5
Great area. Close to everything. Small hotel| about 8 rooms per floor. Very quiet | peaceful rest. Great chicken wings from the restaurant downstairs and complimentary infused water.  2 blocks away from great breakfast bagels etc.,Jan 24| 2019,4
It's great location for shopping,Jan 22| 2019,4
Every single member of the staff was an absolute joy! So helpful and nice. Perfect hotel for a weekend trip to the city!,Jan 21| 2019,5
Great location - could walk everywhere!  Close to coffee shops| restaurants| museums and Broadway.,Jan 21| 2019,5
The location is ideal.  The street is quiet| and it is close to Seventh Avenue and Madison Square Garden.  The lobby is compact.  The staff prompt and friendly.,Jan 18| 2019,4
Great location. Staff very friendly and helpful.   Rooms small but clean. Parking across street reasonable with hotel discount.,Jan 18| 2019,5
A+++++ service Professional staffClean rooms Free off street parking Friday after 8 until Sunday night| Close to time square,Jan 14| 2019,5
Great place| walking distance to Times Square. Staff was very nice and helpful. Rooms were clean. Would definitely stay here again :),Jan 14| 2019,5
Good location and a pleasant stay. Lobby can get a bit crowded but staff are friendly and helpful,Jan 13| 2019,4
It was good. We received cookies upon check in 😁,Jan 10| 2019,4
Everything was fine.  The service was very goods and the guys at the front desk were really good.,Jan 8| 2019,4
Location is great! Always check this hotel when visiting nyc. Staff are super friendly and helpful.,Jan 8| 2019,4
Worn out - really old inside - no front desk to speak of. Not worthy of the Hilton name and certainly no 4 star! Very disaapointing.,Jan 7| 2019,2
Excellent no complaints at all . Child unfortunately was sick on carpet and reported it the receptionist was lovely and more concerned with the child’s health offered medical card | no worries all got sorted . Staff were very nice and cookie was lovely on arrival . Beds are so comfortable. Quiet location but only 5 to 10 min dander yo time square. Central location,Jan 7| 2019,5
The room was wonderful. But I feel like they need to have more elevators for a hotel of his size: the lobby is always filled with a crowd waiting for the elevator.,Jan 7| 2019,5
Rooms out of date and EXTREMELY SMALL. However| the staff is amazing and so kind,Jan 7| 2019,3
Convenient. Friendly staff. But very small room. However| I understand why.,Jan 7| 2019,4
Good location but the room was very noisy and the heating controls were very temperamental.,Jan 7| 2019,4
Well the place is lovely but they have very delicious cookies when you check in so be careful!!!,Jan 6| 2019,5
Friendly staff| very clean| good base for exploring Manhattan and beyond.  Bed was excellent.  Room didn’t have a view like the advert but can’t have everything I suppose.,Jan 5| 2019,4
This was our first trip out to New York. I was Amazing. The Hotel staff were very friendly and professional the hotel was clean and kept in good condition. The location off the hotel is perfect everything from Radio City Music Hall to Time Square is within walking distance. We felt safe and never experienced any problems. I highly recommend this Hotel and try the fruit infused water in the lobby it is Awesome.,Jan 5| 2019,5
I like the staff the location  The room was clean the bed was comfortable,Jan 4| 2019,5
The king size room was super small - there was barely room for 2 people with 4 bags of luggage. The hotel was old and outdated and only one elevator was working when we arrived. We had to climb 9 flights of stairs with all of our luggage to our room. The bed was uncomfortable| we could not regulate the temperature in the room at all. It was either blazing hot or freezing cold. The area was dirty. I just expected more for a Doubletree by Hilton as this is our hotel of choice in every town we travel to.,Jan 4| 2019,3
Great location and staff are very welcoming and friendly would definitely recommend this hotel and we would stay here again,Jan 2| 2019,5
Nice hotel in good location but problems with lifts and not enough bedclothes,Jan 2| 2019,4
Nice hotel in a good location. Close to everything| but quieter than the surrounding streets.,Dec 31| 2018,5
I like the location| as well as the friendly staff.,Dec 30| 2018,4
Staff was very friendly and even took care of our bags after check out since we had a late night flight.,Dec 30| 2018,4
comfy beds| loved the chocolate chip cookie they give at check-in. very courteous staff.,Dec 29| 2018,5
Good location and very nice staff. Enjoyed staying!,Dec 29| 2018,4
Hotel was far from the pics but it is all good. Contstruction were ongoing. We were “double check-in”| meaning given a room that was already occupied since when we entered| I noticed the luggage from the guest before me in line. Usually| I would see a worry or concern but the agent didn’t seem apologetic but she did fix it right away. The elevators will take you forever to go up your floors especially during the holidays since I’m assuming it was a packed season.,Dec 27| 2018,4
The room was very small| outdated and not clean. Wallpaper peeling| black stained stripe across the curtains| dirty grout and rust stains in bathtub. Elevators were really small and slow. Great location and incredible staff made up somewhat for what was an otherwise mediocre stay.,Dec 26| 2018,3
Good property in the middle of NYC. Parking spot they work with didn’t give us the discounted price though.,Dec 26| 2018,4
Old and tired rooms| dirty carpets|  but nice friendly staff and good location,Dec 23| 2018,2
Perfect location and price. Didn’t get the king room I booked| but two double beds. Barely enough water pressure to get the soap off body and no hot water.,Dec 22| 2018,3
A lot of construction going on at front of hotel| looked non essential so whether Xmas was appropriate time? Also no hot water one day. Was told a note had been placed under each door but one had not been placed under mine so cold shower that day. Also the fire alarm went off at about 1.30am one morning. There was very little organization. I was half asleep and managed to get through to reception who advised it was a false alarm however when I opened my door to see if anyone else was exiting I was met with what appeared to be an employee (appeared to have a radio) who wasn’t overly helpful & a naked lady! Quite why no one had offered the poor lady something to cover up I’m not sure? Shortly after the fire department arrived & appeared to be looking at the alarm bell outside my room so whether this explains why the employee was stationed there I don’t know. At the end of the day thankfully it was a false alarm but from my perspective things didn’t seem very well organized which is concerning if it had been a real fire. Also the poor lady that was left standing in the hall naked should really have been provided with something to cover herself up| surely? I’ve stayed at this hotel before & had NO complaints & whilst the construction/hot water are minor in the scheme of things| the fire alarm issue was a little concerning.,Dec 22| 2018,4
Great location.  Nice size room| larger than some other hotels in the immediate area.,Dec 22| 2018,4
The hotel's location was a perfect walking distance to MSG.,Dec 21| 2018,5
The lay-out was a bit strange and cramped (which is pretty standard for NYC hotels but there was still very little counter space and walking space)| and I got two full beds instead of the king bed I requested (which I was warned about at booking). I thought this wasn't going to be an issue but it added to the cramped space issue. This overall was a good choice for a stay if you're not going to be in your room for longer than a sleep or getting ready to go out in the morning| but not if you're looking for 'home comforts'.,Dec 21| 2018,3
Everything you need for  comfortable rest and love,Dec 18| 2018,4
Dump!,Dec 17| 2018,2
Hotel well situated for New York| at a reasonable price.,Dec 16| 2018,3
Very convenient location.  Easy check in. Room was comfortable.,Dec 15| 2018,4
Great location| Good price. Adequate room size and amenities. Extremely fast free wi-fi.,Dec 10| 2018,5
The location was very convenient. Could get to everything in NYC easily.The room was very clean BUT VERY SMALL FOR TWO PEOPLE.,Dec 6| 2018,4
It was fine... they are doing a bit of construction.  Wasn't crazy about the location (personal preference).  Service was great... all the staff are very friendly and helpful.  Bar area is nice.,Dec 5| 2018,4
Friendly staff and good location|pretty basic but very clean and as only spent minimal time in room not a problem.,Dec 5| 2018,4
Friendly staff. I did not like the  noise coming from next rooms especially when neighboring guest leave their rooms you can hear everything happening at hallway and doors closing and opening.,Nov 29| 2018,4
the location was perfect and the room was ok but more monitoring of cleaning needs to be seen to.,Nov 28| 2018,2
Good Hotel for New York stay great breakfast very friendly snd helpfully staff Will recommend and hope to be back.,Nov 27| 2018,4
Outdated and extremely small rooms inconvenient area,Nov 27| 2018,3
Love led the staff and especially the warm cookies they give you!!!!,Nov 24| 2018,5
Extremely friendly staff and very helpful.  The great cookies are a plus also.  Location is good for walking to sites or catching subway.,Nov 15| 2018,5
I have stayed at doubletree hotels for years across the country (I travel for work.) and I can say with certainty that this is bar none the most outdated and scary movie worthy. Pay extra somewhere else. It will be worth it.,Nov 10| 2018,2
Hotel is a little old/dated. Bit stuffy. Hotel bar/rest is not flash. Bed was very comfortable and large for a New York hotel room. Lots of draws and storage for cases and clothes which really helps. Higher floors are better for use of lifts as in the morning theres never room for lower floor guests to get in. First world issues....location is ok but in a bit of a tired/funny spot not really in Chelsea. Street is not appealing. For the price we've had better before.,Nov 9| 2018,4
Clean hotel with bare essentials,Nov 7| 2018,4
We had quite a lot of space with a suite - separate sitting area and two TVs. Tea/ coffee making facility Andy the heating systems were a bit awkward to use,Nov 5| 2018,4
Fab location really enjoyed our stay. Close to good cheap eats Maddison Square and Times Square and 5th Ave shops. What more could you need.,Nov 4| 2018,5
This is one of the most unfortunate stays I've had in a hotel in recent years. There are full and smelly trash bags everywhere| the halls| the stairwell| the walk up to the hotel. There was a sticky spot on my carpet and black mold in the shower. I've been in town for work| working long hours| and put the do not disturb sign on the door so I could sleep in on Saturday and Sunday and both days house keeping knocked and woke me up anyway. Behind the desk is paperwork and clutter.,Nov 3| 2018,1
The location was extremely convenient.The room was clean| staff was willing to help most of the time.But it's important to know that late check out fee is half the day's rate to extend 2 hours and full day's rate to extend 4 hours.Otherwise| everything else was great.,Oct 30| 2018,4
Front desk staff very friendly and helpful. Beautiful view from the room!,Oct 27| 2018,5
Lobby was filthy; heating did not work and staff argued about compensation for going without heat one full day. Bar/restaurant area nothing to write home about. Location of hotel is excellent. There are several other nearby hotels| however| that I would suggest one looks at before staying here. This hotel is a franchise| so not owned by Hilton. Honors members are not treated any differently than other guests.,Oct 23| 2018,1
It was perfect for us the bed was comfy| the room was quiet and the location was central to everything.,Oct 22| 2018,5
I called ahead to find out cost of parking. Was quoted $33.00. Next day at check out bill was $45.00. I complained i was quoted $33.00. They said that was the difference of self park across the street or valet park. I was happy to self park to save the additional $12.00. It is the principle of the matter. You quote $33.00. I was not given the option at check in. Misleading.,Oct 17| 2018,4
I booked one king size room and that was not available on the time of checking. They just gave me a queen size and changed the room next day.  Mattresses were bad and had to request them to change the room again.  So three rooms switched during four day stay:-((,Oct 16| 2018,3
A heavier blanket in room would be great. Requested extra blanket. Both were thin which surprised me for NYC. Hotel staff great!,Oct 15| 2018,4
Check in service was excellent!  Fast. Nice. Professional.,Oct 10| 2018,5
Horrible. Looks nothing like the photos. Would never stay there again.,Oct 9| 2018,1
Hotel was in midst of refurbishment but staff were friendly and acted promptly to any request or issues.,Oct 9| 2018,4
Liked the location.Service was fair. Still waiting for towels I requested! They never came.Room was fair.Hotel needs to be cleaner.,Oct 9| 2018,3
Hallways & Rooms need to be upgraded/refreshed. Due to the age andcwear and tear| the hotel appears unclean. Of the two elevators available| one was out for two days causing lengthy delays to get up & down. Called front desk three times over 45 minute period requesting additional towel sets and coffee cups. I finally found housekeeping in the hallway to get what we needed.  On a positive note if there is one| the hotel was centrally located for the purpose of our visit.,Oct 8| 2018,2
The room service maid threw my toothbrush and toothpaste out of the room. Otherwise everything is fine.,Oct 3| 2018,4
Rooms are too small for the price you pay.,Oct 2| 2018,3
Very happy!  Staff was excellent and very accommodating. Food in restaurant was great.  Location and room exactly what we wanted.,Oct 2| 2018,5
Hope I can get the standard King bed room next time. When I checked in at the hotel| there’s no more room available.,Oct 2| 2018,4
I got the room that wasn't at all looking like the pictures| dirty bed sheets no refrigerator| my food got spoiled. I asked the front desk to change my room and was told that they don't have any other available rooms. The Next day they delivered a refrigerator it had a bad smell in so I didn't use it.  The lobby looked dirty as well smell of the hotel horrible the elevator looked like no one clean it for a long time|  I would rate it this hotel with  2-stars. I spent over $1800 for the room and highly believe this room didn't worse that amount. I had other choices but| made a mistake booking this. If you traveling for business DO NOT BOOK this hotel wifi doesn't work lighting in the room very poor.,Oct 1| 2018,1
The front outside and the lobby of the hotel were under construction so it was a bit of an unexpected  mess upon arrival. The room was quiet| comfortable and nice but small and the bathroom was extremely small - forget about 2 people using the bathroom at the same time. The air conditioner gave off plenty of cool air but its direction was unchangeable and the cold drafts hit my husband's bald head directly while he was sleeping.,Oct 1| 2018,4
Carpet was dirty in hallways| toilet was not fully cleaned in room. Staff were unable to give a 1 hour extension for a late checkout| and would only do so if I paid a half day rate. Elevators took ages to call. Outside was a construction zone and full of laundry cages.,Oct 1| 2018,3
VERY pet friendly| and very welcoming to my cat and I when we needed a last minute place to stay.,Oct 1| 2018,5
It was undergoing construction| so this was probably not the best time to stay there.  The staff tried hard during the construction period| but the lobby was dusty and very small due to the cordoned off sections.  Water pressure was inconsistent.  Front desk was small| so only one person was checking in guests and handling guest issues.,Sep 26| 2018,3
The furnishings are old| carpet are dirty| the bed sheet has a blood stain| the service is bad from the front desk,Sep 25| 2018,2
I moved to this hotel after the horrible experience that's the Pennsylvania.I'm so happy to have moved to the DT| it has a great location| attentive staff and it's very clean and bright.On the negative: The hotel is small| the halls can feel a bit claustrophobic and if you have loud neighbors it will disturb your sleep.,Sep 25| 2018,5
The check-in process was easy and painless| and the front desk staff was so helpful! They printed some tickets for us that we forgot to do before we left and were so friendly. I recommend this hotel - located in a cute little neighborhood with so much to do and easy to get around. Plus| the bed was SO comfortable| we didn't want to get up!,Sep 25| 2018,5
Great location| walking distance from so many things!,Sep 25| 2018,4
Great experience. Staff friendly| helpful and wonderful.  Would return to the hotel again.,Sep 25| 2018,5
Very good value for money inNYC.  Quiet room| comfortable A/C meant a good nights sleep.,Sep 23| 2018,4
Lobby under construction had to wait extended time for elevator service so took stairs half the time.5th foor,Sep 22| 2018,4
Well-located for our event at MSG.  It appeared| perhaps| there was some sort of construction going on as the entrance was filled with rolling bins| the sort laundry might be moved around in.  Check in was fast but not terribly friendly.  The room was clean and comfortable| although a bit worse for wear.  Breakfast was problematic.  I prepaid an extra $20. For breakfast for two.  The desk person said there was no record of it and implied we were trying to ‘pull something’.  He insisted breakfast buffet was $22. Each.   When I showed him my Expedia receipt he took a photo of it and reluctantly let us go into the ‘cafe’.  The cafe turned out to be a smallish room and the buffet was a sad offering of breads| cereal and| what appeared to be| microwaved eggs| bacon and sausage.  I’ve seen better for free at La Quinta and Best Western.  Bottom line I recommend the location and the bed for a comfortable night’s sleep.  Skip the breakfast and grab something at Panera Bread around the corner!,Sep 22| 2018,3
Hotel was nice other than the construction happening. Good area and very friendly staff,Sep 20| 2018,4
Traveling from Europe this hotel may not accommodate your luggage| the room is real small,Sep 20| 2018,5
The Hotel was being remodeled| which was never mentioned when booking the reservations. It was pretty much a mess in the entry and the restaurant was pretty much a old fashion kitchenette. We thought we would sit and have a drink one evening however it was really not the kind of place to sit and even have a conversation. With Soooooo many other Hotels around the exact same area we should have looked further and being on a Business trip we really wanted to have a place where we could sit and discuss business topics. The rooms were very very small| we have traveled to NY for years however haven't stayed in this exact area. Having clients around the area we wanted to get within walking distance to several and this was a good location for that. The room was clean however you will find Old towels (washed many times over)| uncomfortable beds| the bathroom sink had mold on the side of the wood portion that they obviously placed a granite top over. We have stayed at nicer NY hotels in a close proximity to this one and actually looked at 5-6 others that were within 1 to 2 block of the Doubletree that we should have booked| Not bad - but would select something different next time| even after the remodel| didn't look like the rooms were getting done just the downstairs lobby and areas|,Sep 18| 2018,2
This place was perfectly located for a college visit to Parsons school of design and fashion Institute of technology. Both within walking distance. Our room was decent sized very clean really comfortable bed decent bathroom and quiet with a functioning air conditioner which is saying something in New York City,Sep 17| 2018,4
Last minute trip to NYC so I picked this location because it was close to the venue my son needed to be at for a show. The hotel was under construction so the lobby was a mess. In fact it felt like there was a hole in the floor at the main entrance and there was just a rug thrown on top of it. The room itself was nice but I noticed little things in the middle of the night that irritated me. The shower head was dripping water and the smoke detector started chirping in the middle of the night like the batteries needed to be changed. The room was a bit outdated and the bed linen and towels were thin and rough. I only stayed one night.,Sep 16| 2018,3
The room that I booked was not ready so they decided to upgrade us to a suite for the night. The suite was only prepared for 2 people when there was four of us and the bed sheets were urine stained and no cover on the duvet. On the second day| we were asked to change rooms again but again they had no room ready for us and we were asked to leave everything in our room with our valuables out of the safe for the hotel staff to move. I explained that we had valuables and passports that needed to stay in the safe and that I will not leave them unattended; they said that we can leave them or come back at 12 when there is a room available and if I didn’t do either of the 2 choices I would be escorted from the premises. The manager on duty had a discusting attitude and did not want to help us one bit| even though it was the hotels fault that we had to move rooms,Sep 14| 2018,1
Great location especially if you enjoy walking. Easy walk to the high line| meat packing district| & restaurants|,Sep 14| 2018,3
Hotel is under construction.  Great location! No issues with my stay. No microwave access for guest.,Sep 11| 2018,4
I like that it's within walking distance to New York areas like Times Square.  I also like that it's cleanly.,Sep 11| 2018,4
Great staff.  Helpful amidst the lobby construction.,Sep 10| 2018,5
List too much to mention here. Dirty carpets| ripped base of bed| no guest facilities in lobby| building work. In accomadating staff. For an advertised 4 star hotel- it is appalling- not even up to a 2 star!,Sep 10| 2018,1
Renovations in the lobby made it messy and very close quarters as most of the lobby was cordoned off to guests,Sep 9| 2018,4
Our hotel room was tiny| dirty and had a terrible odour. The carpet in the rooms was dirty. It is under a huge renovation so the whole lobby is torn up. There were workmen everywhere. It was not good. The staff were very nice and doing their best under the circumstances. I felt like it was not good value for the money,Sep 8| 2018,2
This hotel it’s not even 3 star | carpet smells inside the room | renovation at lobby a messy place,Sep 8| 2018,2
First the tv didn't work 2nd 2 days in a row ran out of toilet paper 3rd the tub drain wouldn't come up when they came to drain it they left it lay in tub with chain attached and nasty hair on it that wasn't mine 4th my luggage was moved 2x after the maid had left the room 2 separate days even 1 day the room safe was left open as I didn't use the safe I felt relieved  I've stayed at many Hilton's in variety of different states this was defiently an unexpected experience,Sep 6| 2018,2
Nice enough hotel| just a shame it was going through construction when we were there but that would be my only negative. Staff were friendly and helpful. Location was brilliant. The room itself was lovely as well.,Sep 3| 2018,3
The location is good| but they didn’t change bedsheets everyday| that was not good! Specially when it’s a hot in New York summer.,Sep 2| 2018,4
The worst part of my stay was| by far| the check-in.  Very unfriendly staff.  Then| when I went to my room and walked| there was someone else in bed in the room!!  I think it scared me almost as much as it did her. When I went back downstairs| they didn’t seem at all concerned (or surprised.) I asked them to walk me up to me new room to make sure there was no one in there and they acted like I was being an impossible guest.  One of the guys even rolled his eyes.The hotel was under construction| which I wish I had known.  This doesn’t feel like the quality of hotel that I’ve always known Doubletree to be.,Sep 2| 2018,1
I CHECKED INTO THE UNIT AFTER LUNCH AND TRIED TO TAKE A NAP BUT WORKERS WERE WORKING ABOVE MY UNIT AND WERE MAKING LOTS OF NOISE UNTIL 5PM THAT DAYTHE HOTEL SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER THAN RENTING THE ROOM OUT DUE TO THE RENOVATION THAT WAS GOING ON...,Sep 1| 2018,2
Everything was well and the service was expected we had a very good experience in the hotel,Sep 1| 2018,5
Everything was great. Hotel is under going major remodel| so it’s a bit chaotic with the elevators and the lobby. That said| the wonderful staff| including the friendly construction guys| clean room and awesome cookies make up for it 😊The breakfast buffet however is a bit ridiculous. I didn’t include it in my stay and still had breakfast there one morning - small bowl of oatmeal and a couple of bites of scrambled eggs - $25. There should be an a la carte menu.,Sep 1| 2018,4
Staff was great. Hotel was getting renovated but the staff did all they could to ensure a good stay. Slow elevators but also might be due to renovation work,Aug 31| 2018,4
As a Hilton Honor member| I stayed at Hilton all over the world and this one is the worse one I ever experienced.Unfriendly staff plus the inconvenience caused by ongoing renovation made our stay a terrible one.,Aug 28| 2018,1
Not what we were expecting. Rooms look completely different from the pictures on Expedia. However| the staff and housekeeping were extremely nice and great service.,Aug 28| 2018,3
sheets were never changed during our trip and had blood on them| a lot of construction was going on downstairs so you couldn't sit outside| and hotel staff don't give consistent answers to questions,Aug 28| 2018,2
I like that this property is within walking distance of Times Square.,Aug 26| 2018,4
I loved my stay at this hotel. The staff was accommodating and friendly. My room was extremely clean| and the bed was super comfortable. Considering that this hotel is currently under renovations| I think the staff (specifically Alex and Harrington) are doing a great job. I will definitely return.,Aug 26| 2018,5
The room was clean| but small. The hotel was being remodeled downstairs| but the staff were friendly and professional.,Aug 26| 2018,4
Hotel currently under renovation but room was clean| quiet and nice.,Aug 23| 2018,5
The hotel is currently undergoing renovations. I will definitely book again because of location and staff friendliness.  Can't wait to see the final results!,Aug 22| 2018,4
We requested extra blankets a couple times and ended up having to get them ourselves after waiting almost 2 hrs,Aug 22| 2018,3
The hotel was nice| although they were renovating the lobby. We had a suite| floor number 21. The suite was small| decoration wasn't very fresh| but the room was very clean| bed was comfortable| shower worked well and the staff was great. Location was alright| although a bit dark at night| when you come back from 7th and 29th...Overall| nothing to complain| room did what we needed| good place to sleep| but that's it :),Aug 20| 2018,4
Hotel was under renovation. We didn’t know when I booked hotel. When we checked in| we went to our room and the keys didn’t work. Got new keys and entered the room to find someone else had already been checked into that room. Luggage and personal stuff all over. We got a new room and my wife lost an earring down the bathroom sink drain because there was no stopper. While taking a shower| I accidentally stepped on the stopper and the lever to release it was broken. Not a pleasant stay AT ALL!!!!,Aug 19| 2018,1
Probably the worst Doubletree I have stayed at.  The hotel is in renovation mode. The small rooms are cramped| nowhere to sit except the bed.  When I booked| Hotels.com didn’t reveal the renovation state. 29th street is a bit sketchy.  Small restaurant.Vending and ice on every 6 floors so is you need ice| you may have to go up or down 3 floors. 2 small elevators for 25+ floors.Lower floors very dingy and not much scenery.,Aug 19| 2018,3
The hotel lobby was being renovated and this information wasn’t shared st the time of booking. There was barely any space to stand at the reception area and not a single seat. The house keeping is sloppy. On some days they wouldn’t replace the glasses or plastic caps and took my sleeping gown which I hadn’t got back at check out. The rooms are tiny for sharing. Not ideal for more than two people though marketed as a room for four.,Aug 18| 2018,3
Nice little hotel| room was very quiet and comfortable if small. Beds were outstanding| staff was warm and friendly.,Aug 16| 2018,5
The location was perfect| the beds were comfortable. The hotel was under renovations during our stay.,Aug 14| 2018,5
Staff are friendly. The construction/remodeling is the major issue I had. They have the supplies and the linens piled up in the front courtyard blocking the view of the street. Must be a much better place for them to put these things.,Aug 14| 2018,3
Great.. Place was clean and comfy.,Aug 13| 2018,5
Staff was nice| but rooms were dated and uncomfortable. Way too overpriced,Aug 13| 2018,2
All very nice but there is constuction on hotel| but in general all good| very helpfull staff,Aug 11| 2018,4
The location was amazing. I wish I could say about the room conditions. It badly needs updating especially the bathroom. The shower curtain needs to be washed or changed because the smell was horrible. It has a musty or dampy smell to it| kinda like when it wasn’t dried properly. I thought it was just our bathroom| but I also checked my parents room and they also have the musty/damp smell in their shower curtain as well. The bathroom towel holder came loose during our stay. I think they are doing construction in the hotel and I really hope they would update the rooms too.,Aug 10| 2018,4
The room & hotel was  very clean. Overall| the staff was very friendly and helpful in giving us directions to various places we were Interested in. Convenient location close to Penn Station. Also| they gave each of us a bottle of water & a warm delicious cookie each day on our way out when we stopped at the desk.,Aug 7| 2018,5
Going thru lobby renovation but everyone seemed to be flexible.  Rooms are small but have all the essentials and are clean| modern and comfortable. And of course you get welcomed with a hot cookie!,Aug 6| 2018,4
This hotel is in a great location right by the highline| MSG| and Penn Station. Staff was extremely friendly and welcoming. Warm cookies are always a plus of course and there was also flavored water in the lobby. We wanted to walk around town for a bit after we checked out and they kept our bags for us which was a huge help. There’s an awesome little Japanese cafe across the street that we highly recommend. Oh and we only live about an hour north of NYC so we wanted to drive in and there is a great parking garage across the street and with validated parking it was a steal compared to other garages! 10/10 would stay here again.,Aug 5| 2018,5
This was a good bargain in Manhattan| but the entrance and common area was filthy.  The rugs coming in to the hotel looked like they hadn't been vacuumed in weeks.  The floors were dirty.  There was trash everywhere.  This hotel is under construction| but there was no excuse for the condition of this property.  I stay at a lot of DoubleTree Properties.  They are usually nice| so I was shocked at this property!,Aug 3| 2018,3
Centrally located to shopping areas| subway and walking distance to times square.,Aug 3| 2018,4
i wish i knew ahead of time about there renovation| they had two elevators which included the work men. no lobby and no out side area which was in was in a picture which helped to decide to stay there.,Aug 2| 2018,1
Overall good experience! Yeah. Just filling in additional words as I ‘m unable to move forward unless I put in more characters.,Aug 1| 2018,4
The hotel is under construction so it was a bit strange to have people outside my window. Also| the lobby has tarps up and scaffolding  outside. There are only 2 elevators and they take a very long time to come to each floor. It was faster for me to take the stairs 11 floors up and down.The rooms are a bit small| but to be expected. The beds are comfy and everything is very well laid out. The rooms are very clean and comfy!,Jul 31| 2018,4
Hotel in under construction. Location is great.,Jul 31| 2018,3
Great front desk service. Wonderful room. Only reason for 4star was that it was under renovation. Can’t wait to come back when it’s complete.,Jul 30| 2018,4
Very nice stay. Very comfortable bed and pillows. Convenient location. Very pleasant and supportive staff. Great value.,Jul 30| 2018,5
It was in a good location. Walking distance to Madison square garden and subway stations. The hotel is in the process of contruction so that would be a con but not much of an inconvenience. The restaurant bar is small and enclosed. Maybe add more lighting to it to make it more open. The room with view to the Empire state was not great. My expectation was maybe a full on view of it but it was not. But overall it was a good stay.,Jul 30| 2018,4
Everything about our stay was excellent,Jul 29| 2018,5
The front counter staff was great. They had construction going on and the lobby was very small to maneuver thru with all our luggage. The room was a little smaller then we are used to as well.,Jul 29| 2018,4
Tiny rooms| unfriendly service,Jul 28| 2018,3
Very disappointed in our stay here. The entire lobby is under construction with men coming in and out blocking the entry and clogging the elevators. Our room was dingy and dirty with no towels or face clothes available. I'm not sure how a hotel doesn't have face clothes for an entire week but somehow they managed.,Jul 26| 2018,1
This hotel was a basic hotel| for the price I didn't really expect anything more. What bothered me is when I booked the hotel there was no indication that the hotel is currently going under renovation. The bathroom looks like it was half-way finished with the remodel| there was foam coming out of the corners of the mirror and just felt dirty. Not a pleasant experience- probably won't be back.,Jul 23| 2018,3
They gave our room away when we were 30mins away from it. We paid for the room over a month prior to our trip to NYC. Which left us looking for a room at 10pm on a Saturday night with 2 kids in tow. Thanks for nothing Double tree,Jul 22| 2018,1
As a former Diamond level Hilton Honors member I’ve stayed hundreds of nights in Hilton properties all over the country. I’ve stayed in their Hampton Inns| Double Trees| Hilton’s and the Waldorf Astoria properties for years| so I can feel fairly confident that this is the worst that they have to offer.  Now| they are aware of this| and appear to be in the midst of a total face lift inside and out| but that construction only makes it worse as a guest. The room was dirty (mold and crud in the bathroom) and the furniture literally falling apart| the beds and pillows were Super 8 quality| and the AC system was barely working. The room smelled terrible| and got worse with every cycle of the AC adding a putrid musty mold smell into the air. In fact| the only thing positive about the property is that it does a good job of eliminating the city sounds| although the windows were so filthy that we could barely see outside. They let this property go way too far before beginning this facelift| and should be embarrassed to charge $400 a night for such a dive. Finally| the property has no lobby| it’s literally the size of a bathroom| and does not have a single chair. Outside there were four Kmart quality plastic chairs scattered amongst construction materials and upright ashtrays| but if you can stand the smell of the urine and overflowing/ smoldering ashtrays| you take your life in your hands with the construction being directly overhead. Conrad Hilton is rolling in his grave.,Jul 21| 2018,2
There's some renovations going on that we didn't know about. There's only two small elevators so the wait times are significant. The room was clean but clearly very dated. Carpets could use a face lift. It's a no frills hotel getting more than its share of benefit from the Hilton brand.,Jul 16| 2018,3
Expedia| unfortunately| messed up our reservations. Their inventory did not match the hotel's room inventory so we did not get the two double bedrooms like we ordered. Thankfully| DoubleTree still was able to accommodate us and they placed us in one double bedroom and two king bedrooms at no extra cost. The staff overall was excellent and very nice! We didn't eat the breakfast but from what I could tell it was nice and it was always packed in the mornings.It was centrally located for the most part. Within walking distances to a lot of sights like the Empire State Building and stores (Macy's| Nordstrom Rack| H&M|etc.) which was a bonus. Just be aware the streets in Chelsea are not as clean as other areas in NYC so watch your step when walking. If it hasn't been raining and you see a puddle| don't step in it. It's not rain.   The hotel is under renovation at least in the lobby area from what I could see. The rooms definitely need some refurbishing but nonetheless| the beds were comfortable and clean and the showers were great. I probably wouldn't pick this hotel to stay for a long length of time or at least not until their renovations are done. But it was a good bang for your buck.,Jul 16| 2018,3
Great location.  Comfortable beds.  Room and bathroom were small but probably typical for New York.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.,Jul 14| 2018,4
The staff was friendly and helpful|  The hotel is undergoing renovations and was very noisy and congested due to the lobby being closed off.,Jul 11| 2018,3
hotel location is great. But room was awful| too small| bad odor in the room and beds| no success to change the room. Asked to have mini refrigerator without success as well.,Jul 9| 2018,2
Currently under construction so there are only 2 elevators which at one point there was a line just to go up. Lobby was cut in half so it got crowded and crammed. It was also occasionally loud due to the machinery being used. Smaller than I expected but it is NYC so it makes sense. Great location and access to subways and tourist areas. Staff was friendly and helpful. Room had everything we needed and was a nice stay. It wasn’t anything fancy| but it wasn’t bad. If you need a place to rest your head| get in a million showers (with that summer humidty!)| great A/C| nice location| then this place should do it!,Jul 7| 2018,4
Good location| friendly staff| and reasonable parking. Rooms need some updating.,Jul 7| 2018,4
Front desk stuffs are very friendly but housekeeping is not up to the mark of Hilton.,Jul 6| 2018,3
The service is very good and the people are friendly and helpful. Unfortunately this hotel is in need of a refresh| which I expect is going to happen given the scaffolding out front. The bathroom smelled like a gym locker| which we suspected was the shower curtain. The 90+ weather in NYC didn't help. Room was very small as was the bathroom and the sink and furnishings in the bathroom were worn. The towels were also thin and small. The fan in the bathroom was also very loud as was the air conditioner. The location is great| but the hotel needs an upgrade.,Jul 6| 2018,3
It was honestly a complete nightmare. This is my first ever review| of anything - I feel that strongly about how bad this hotel is. The room was so humid that everything felt sticky| no matter how cold we set the temperature. The floors made my bare feet smell like vomit. I had to beg to receive any towels. Every time our room was cleaned| they took all the dirty towels| but didn't replace them with clean ones unless we called to ask multiple times. Even then| we'd get them hours later| or even days later. Couldn't shower on the first night. On the last night| my mother showered and dried herself with hand towels. The rooms were tiny - don't expect to fit 3 or 4 people in a double - it was very tight with only two. There was always a giant line at the elevator. I was completely ignored at the restaurant. The list could go on and on. When I was checking out| I saw multiple people trying to cancel early - guess I wasn't the only one feeling this way.,Jul 5| 2018,1
I did not know the hotel was in middle of a renovation.  that coupled with limited elevators and no AC in the 5th floor hallway was disappointing.  However| your staff more than made up for these things.  Your staff ROCKS!!!,Jul 5| 2018,4
We love staying at the Double Tree wherever we travel. This one was dirty and the room was musty. We asked for room towels twice & the issue was never rectified when we called multiple times. Not the best experience.,Jul 3| 2018,3
Dirty bathroom and room.  The smell was horrible.  Renovations were not completed as stated at time of booking.,Jul 2| 2018,1
UNDER CONSTRUCTION.  Jackhammers and noise| jackhammers and noise . . . pretty awful.,Jun 30| 2018,2
The hotel wasn’t the best for it to be a Hilton. The first night I stayed there they booked someone else for the same room I was in and they walked in on me and my guest. The elevator was broke the whole time I was there which caused a 15 min delay to get to your room. The rooms are very small not for anybody who is big or out of shape. For the price I paid I could’ve stay someone nicer. Valet charged 50.00 a day when you could’ve parked on the street for a cheaper price. A lot of maintenance needs to be done to this hotel,Jun 26| 2018,1
Staff were super nice| room was clean and pretty roomy for NYC. Lots of people on here said elevators took forever| but if that's an issue for you| welcome to New York| it's literally a problem everywhere. Overall| it was great and I'd stay here again.,Jun 23| 2018,4
Everything you’d want in a hotel in NYC| reasonable prive| comfortable bed| clean room| great staff and nice location.,Jun 23| 2018,5
Nice hotel| great location.,Jun 21| 2018,4
The hotel is under renovation| the 2 elevators are incredibly slow and always crowded| and the staff is not friendly at all. The room is tiny!,Jun 19| 2018,3
Location is great!,Jun 19| 2018,4
The room smelled badly of cigarette smoke from previous guests. At the prices being charged| this is unacceptable.,Jun 18| 2018,3
If you want to stay at Double Tree stay at the one in time square it’s so much better for just a little more. This was small and cramped up. We had booked a king bed. But that most definitely wasn’t a king. I am currently on my own king bed with my baby and husband and it is so much more roomier than that one. I even asked the front staff to make sure. The location was OK. Close to Koreatown| penn station| some restaurants. The actual block was dirty and bummy. We walked over from 8th Avenue and kind of felt uncomfortable with the area. But towards 7th was much better.,Jun 18| 2018,3
Very nice & friendly atmosphere very clean room it was close to Madison sq.  garden  which made it nice,Jun 15| 2018,5
The first room we stayed in smelled so bad and musty that it made my asthma worse and I coughed all night. We ended up moving to another room. It wasn’t musty in the 2nd room| but the bathroom tub and the sink in the bathroom had drain issues. Please change out all your carpets and ventilate those rooms!!!,Jun 11| 2018,3
Upon arrival did not know hotel was being renovated...the morning we were checking out there was hammering and drilling the the floor above us early in the morningOther then that the hotel was good and location was good for the price,Jun 9| 2018,4
There is virtually no security in this hotel. No bellmen to assist. The fire alarm went off 4 times during the night beginning at 2:00 AM. When we tried calling down to the front desk| there was no answer and we were left not knowing what was happening in the hotel or if we needed to evacuate. There was a sign on the phone indicating that there was a 24 hour care line| to call at any hour. After repeated tries| still no answer. The hotel is quite dated| narrow| stuffy hallways and the entire front entrance is scaffolded with ladders and tarps piled everywhere. Total disappointment. We assumed the doubletree by Hilton would be a very nice place to stay. Unfortunately that was not th case.,Jun 5| 2018,1
It was poor overall compare to other hotels near around at same level.,Jun 5| 2018,1
Good hotel. Rooms on small side|but big advantage is they validate parking at local garage for discounted price of $33/24 hours,Jun 1| 2018,4
Great front desk staff| awesome location for price! Bartender /bar was less to be desired but didn’t expect much more from a bar at doubletree . Room is very small| kind bed takes up most and it is a true nyc space constraint experience but worth it for price...it’s hard to find a hostel much cheaper,May 30| 2018,4
The hotel room was clean and comfortable. The front desk employees were not very helpful| it was clear that the hotel does not hire qualified people for that job,May 29| 2018,3
Really good location,May 28| 2018,4
The hotel was average.  Construction in the entry felt less than inviting. The front desk and concierge were helpful and friendly.,May 25| 2018,4
Great bed.,May 23| 2018,3
Great locationGreat staffComfortable bedsLobby needs makeover,May 22| 2018,4
great location central to everything and not in the crazy busy but walkable to all destinations. wifi supplied not always the best and kept dropping out.,May 21| 2018,4
Really disappointed in this Hilton property. I am a Hilton Honors member and the staff made multiple comments about booking” through a third party”. Rude front desk.   Dirty lobby. Bed good and housekeeping good. I stay in lots of hotels and very rarely leave poor reviews but I would never recommend. Too many other places in area that exceed.,May 21| 2018,2
Typical small room| but okay. We were on the second floor with a view of scaffolding over the front entrance. This is where quests smoked which seeped through the AC unit. Bathroom was tiny with little room for two people to place their toiletries.,May 18| 2018,5
Hotel is in good location| close to good restaurants and bars.The room itself was very small for the price.  This hotel room was booked during a point where flights were being cancelled| and DoubleTree was severely price gouging.  This room should likely have been $200-$250/night.  They charged $1|400 for this night's stay!  It's extremely disappointing to see a hotel take advantage of people in unfortunate circumstances like this.,May 17| 2018,3
This hotel is not a Double Tree standard hotel.  Room is small| toilet is very small. And cleaning staff even fails to replace shampoo and paper cups. Not recommend.,May 16| 2018,2
The room was a bit small but not unbearable. The staff was great. The staff was the best part of my stay. I will definitely recommend this hotel to friends looking to stay in Manhattan.,May 15| 2018,4
Great location| staff was very friendly. The only downer was the ice machine in the 2nd floor was dead for 3 days straight. (No biggie) Otherwise| a great stay!,May 15| 2018,4
Hotel was nice and the DoubleTree cookies were great. The exterior area was under construction (scaffolding) when we arrived| but I guess that's New York. The room was cozy (we had a King room). The hotel is within excellent walking distance of stores/restaurants. I would definitely stay there again because it was very affordable.,May 5| 2018,4
This is a 27 story hotel with two tiny elevators.  During our four day stay on the 25th floor| only one elevator worked so you we were waiting up to 20 minutes for the elevator.  Very disappointing.,May 1| 2018,2
We’ll definitely go back again!,Apr 29| 2018,5
the rooms were old  and small.  the AC was noisy| I had to shut it down. One elevator was out of order.  It tooks 25 mns to go up or down| stopping at every floor.,Apr 28| 2018,1
Tucked away from Times Square this hotel gives you the best of both worlds. The room was small and I got two double beds instead of one and the view wasn’t great. Actually felt like the room was dark because of the lack of sunlight. Anyways| would recommend for short stays.,Apr 17| 2018,4
Hotel room is too too small. Wait for the Elevators is way too long! Too expensive for what you get. Hotel staff and services were good.,Apr 14| 2018,3
Went to MSG for a hockey game! Very close to the arena| Penn Station and Times Sq. Room was clean and surprisingly quiet for downtown hotel. Room size was small but it was just me and a young kid so was fine for that. Overall good experience. Location even better!,Apr 7| 2018,4
The room was very nice and very comfortable. I had to be up early in the morning and I did not want to get out of bed!. I had view of the Empire  State Building. I would stay there again!,Mar 29| 2018,5
Our room smelled like cigarettes it's a non smoking hotel. There was dust all over the room. The room decor is completely outdated. To to this there was a used syringe right by the armoire. The assistant general manager was a bit helpful but honestly it was not worth staying there. This is the second time at this property. Not happening again.,Mar 29| 2018,1
I suppose it is reasonable for NYC. Not great but sufficiently comfortable. Not too much noise from the outside (on the high floors). The doors are thin though| and there is a fair amount of noise from the hall| including from the cleaning people. They are very skimpy on towels and basic supplies for some reason.,Mar 28| 2018,4
Front desk is very unpleasant. Overall nice room.,Mar 26| 2018,1
Just a heads up to anyone thinking about staying here.1. They charge $25 per bag at bell if it’s past 11pm 2. They don’t have all day housekeeping so if you miss the service in the morning| They won’t come back.3. The doors are heavy and they should change the hinges because you hear doors slam very loud from inside your room. 4. They forgot to change the clock ahead an hour so we thought we had an extra hour of sleep but no.. they charged us $100 late checkout fee. And they didn’t even call us to warn us. 5. The front desk people| All of them so far have been non accommodating. For a last minute deal it’s good but be warned they will try to nickel and dime you.,Mar 26| 2018,2
The rooms was a bit small| however the hotel very clean and the customer service was awesome!!,Mar 25| 2018,4
There wasn’t a complimentary breakfasf. I found out the hard way. Went downstairs and helped myself to some eggs . Received a $22 bill for it because I didn’t have a breakfast voucher. Most expensive eggs of my life ! I wish someone would have told me before I sat down and ate :(,Mar 21| 2018,3
I was surprised.  My only complaint about this property for the two days I stayed there was the carpet in the hallways.  It was old but with ice| salt and snow that happens. The staff was friendly.  The location to Macy’s was great.  5 blocks and you’re shopping and eating at K-Town.,Mar 20| 2018,5
Great location.,Mar 20| 2018,5
Good place to stay| local| clean and close to many NYC activities.,Mar 19| 2018,5
Small and noisy.  Cabbies don't just honk; they lay into their horns. Bed was good.,Mar 18| 2018,3
I liked this hotel overall| but I can’t rate it as highly. I love Doubletrees and the service and free cookies. However| the frustration we had is is due to the fact that they didn’t let us know about the construction going on upon arrival. We got a note under the door from management that we didn’t even see until the morning. They said they’d be doing construction on the walkway from 8am on. Well we really wanted to sleep in because we both work later in the day. This was very disruptive to our sleep and extremely loud as we were right above the street. This is unprofessional and ridiculous for such a highly rated hotel in NYC. I would have asked for a refund or discount but just wanted to leave. Also the comforter was falling apart and the room was a bit musty. I’ll be staying at a different Double Tree or other hotels from now on.,Mar 17| 2018,3
Recently stayed here with my son for two nights. We loved the location....it is close to Penn Station and subway lines.,Mar 15| 2018,5
Good hotel to stay at in Chelsea. Location was important to us and it is walking distance to time square. the lobby is really small but the staff was very prompt and efficient. Their cookies they give out at the front desk are amazing!!!The room was kind of small for 2 people. We had a room with double beds. Not much room in there but it worked out. They didn’t have a closet in the room but they had an armoire with drawers and a couple hangers to hang longer dresses and jackets. The bathroom was so small but that what to expect in New York. Good showers. The hotel room seemed a bit outdated. The comforters seemed dirty and the bathrooms might need a little more cleaning up. I would stay there again for a quick weekend trip. For the price of almost $200 a night it was worth it. Thank you,Mar 15| 2018,4
The service at the hotel was exceptional. The room was nice| quiet and clean despite the age of the building. Bar service and food was good. Would absolutely stay here again and felt I received terrific value on this room. Location was convenient.,Mar 12| 2018,5
The biggest selling feature here is the location.  It is very walkable to most of the sites that you would want to see| or at very least| a subway station.  The room was on the small side| but this was expected and no problem at all.  I was disappointed about the quality of housekeeping.  The lotion and shampoo in the room had been previously used| and the toilet was not flushed prior to my arrival.  There was also some garbage left behind on the floor| and the tissue box was empty.  None of these are too significant| but I expected more for a DoubleTree/Hilton property.  On the topic of the room| while the water pressure was EXCELLENT| the temperature fluctuated significantly between cool and very hot.  I am returning to NYC again in the summer| and may look at staying here again| but only if the price was right.,Mar 6| 2018,4
Early check-in not "available"| as nor'easter storm raged outside. Waited 4 hours for a room assignment. Not quite believable that room not available until the posted 4 p.m. check-in time. Perhaps if I didn't have a discounted reservation ...,Mar 4| 2018,3
The hotel is in a good location and appears fine. The king size bed was also very comfortable. After we checked out| a staff member told me very quickly (before even leaving the hotel) that I had left a coat in the wardrobe which was great and very helpful! However| the rooms were really quite small for two people with large suitcases- we found ourselves walking over our bags regularly. The bathroom had very little space for wash bags or make up bags-no shelves. The hotel requires a revamp/upgrade| but in general it is okay! The hotel lift system is very poor- it could take 10-15 minutes to go up/come down from higher floors. On check in we were given no information about the hotel facilities or local area.,Feb 28| 2018,3
Tired old property with a lot of maintenance issues. Front desk staff also had real “NYC” attitude.,Feb 25| 2018,2
Staff friendly and very helpful. Great location! Walking distance to Empire| Fith ave| Madison square and time square. Subway stations close too.,Feb 25| 2018,5
The good: great location| great price| central to everything| and an easy commute to many different places.The bad: the rooms are well maintained| but tiny.  That said| I my rooms could just be New York standards. Unfortunately| you could hear everything going on in the hallway outside the room up and down the hall. So when housekeeping comes by at 9 a.m. and is knocking on the door five doors down from you you'll still hear them| and they'll wake you up.  If you have a do nkt disturb| its meaningless because you'll|still hear housekeeping| and all your neighbors.  The bathroom was nice (smaller| with not much vanity space) but the peeling paint didn't do much for me.  The ugly:  Maybe its just me| but for several hundred a night you expect certain things| like a bathroom that doesn't look like its falling apart| windows that you can't feel the cold air through| hvac that heats the tiny room well...  I was 0 for 3| on those but the staff did their best to be on point and helpful.Overview: the staff is great| but the hotel is more like a motel by most city standards.  NY is absurdly expensive| so set your standards low and you won't be disappointed.  As is| Staff:4.5. Hotel:3. Value for NY: 4.25. (All out of 5)..,Feb 23| 2018,3
In every way and in everyone we had contact with at the hotel|  it was Great! Pleasant smiles| conversation and thoughtfulness are abundant there. WE WILL BE BACK. Thank you very much!!,Feb 22| 2018,5
The hotel is off the beaten track tucked off the street on 29th. The room was small even by NYC standards| bathroom looked like it had not really been cleaned in number of stays| just a quick wipe. Shower was moldy| carpets needed work. Overall the condition of the room was poor. They definitely need to ramp up the inspection of the rooms. Also| someone needs to stay on top of the engineering department. Our room had a broken picture frame| a bathroom mirror that was delaminating| and some poorly repaired furniture.,Feb 20| 2018,2
N,Feb 20| 2018,4
One of the elevators was frequently out of service ( the majority of our four day stay)| leaving only one to transport guests in their 27 floor hotel. This was rather frustrating. Great views | great staff...,Feb 12| 2018,4
Booked a last minute stay and was not disappointed. I was nervous because the price seemed too reasonable ($95) for a decent hotel in midtown...but i was wrong. It was clean (showed some signs of age)| comfortable (very comfy bed)| and centrally located  (near 28th st metro station and penn station.) Elevator went down one morning| but we were onlyon the 3rd floor| so it wasnt too inconvenient. I would definately stay there again.,Feb 12| 2018,4
This is a great hotel with a TERRIBLE elevator situation.  Get a room on a lower floor and take the stairs.,Feb 10| 2018,5
Easy access to subway.  Very walkable neighborhood.  Close to sightseeing and shopping.  Room was comfortable bathroom small and ceilings with cracked plaster.  Enjoyed the view of the empire state building from our room.  Found nightly rates to be quite reasonable.,Feb 8| 2018,4
The receptionist were very friendly and nice. Great location| would recommend to others.,Feb 6| 2018,5
very comfortable and close to stores| theaters| restaurant an Penn Station.,Feb 4| 2018,5
Couldn't check-in upon arrival at 2pm. The booking stated check-in starts at 4pm but the hotel did not accommodate us and gave us a low floor room stating that the hotel was overbooked (we had however booked several weeks ago).Bed and pillows excellent but the room was very small and dusty. Some channels on TV did not work and the satelite/internet connection was poor.The elevators were slow and insufficient for the demand.,Feb 1| 2018,3
Convenient location. Front desk and staff were so nice and friendly. Would definitely come back,Jan 28| 2018,5
Awesome area close to time square and penn station and great staff.,Jan 25| 2018,5
Great location| walkable in heart of Chelsea.  Rooms are boutique size but very functional and comfortable.,Jan 23| 2018,5
Very nice staff and they understand urgency. Would recommend and will stay here again,Jan 22| 2018,5
we were put in a corner room that was handicap accessible which we did not need.  The bathroom was odd due to this with a  door that slammed shut automatically so you had to prop it with something to keep it open.  The bathroom was not cleaned well and there is mold that needs to be dealt with.  Overall| this room really dampened our stay here and I will not stay here again.,Jan 18| 2018,3
The rooms are tiny you can here everything in the whole building and other rooms. Way too close together.,Jan 15| 2018,3
Nice hotel located few blocks from Penn Station where we arrived for our stay in NY. There is a NY subway station around the corner of street making it very convenient to travel to the places we had planned to visit. Hotel was clean and staff was humble overall except the check in experience was a bit cold,Jan 15| 2018,4
arrived from niagara falls by train| walked about 10mins to reach the hotel.,Jan 14| 2018,4
rooms a little small| and elevators a little slow (and only 2 elevators for 20+ floors)| but room was very clean and comfortable.  Staff was helpful.,Jan 13| 2018,4
a dinky place clean enuff to spend a nite - nothing else. close your eyes and your senses about hotels| sleep in and leave.  halls are very loud as well.  can hear anything outside your door.,Jan 11| 2018,3
It was perfect for the price and the location. Could not ask for better.,Jan 10| 2018,5
I enjoyed being able to get a latte right across the street and the location.,Jan 7| 2018,4
Great price for an excellent location in the heart of Manhattan! My second stay here and I do not have any complaints. Would definitely recommend it!,Jan 6| 2018,4
Nothing to report|  clean and comfortable Good location,Jan 5| 2018,3
So glad I made the right choice in booking this hotel.The location is perfect for access to 6th/5th Av| the staff were helpful and efficient.The room was comfortable and everything worked well.  I took breakfast in bed which was delivered to my room on time and was enough food to feed an army!  Delicious!2 suggestions for improvement would be that the corridors could do with a little sprucing up and the vending machines could have a little more variety| e.g. some snacks as well as drinks.  The vending machine on 17th floor swallowed my coins| so maybe just needs a little tinkering.,Jan 4| 2018,5
Hotel was reasonable for the price but wasn’t nearly as upmarket as other double trees I have stayed in. The heater was very noisy and intrusive.,Jan 4| 2018,3
The hotel is well situated in NYC| everything is at walking distance. The room I had was quite small and simple| very overpriced for what it is| but this is NYC and it was New year's| so you won't find anything cheap.Bed was comfortable| and the room was clean. Buffet breakfast was good but pricey.,Jan 3| 2018,3
Great location. Close enough to time square. Room was VERY quiet. Clean. Restaurants close by. Will definitely stay again.,Jan 3| 2018,5
The wifi was terrible. The front desk lady wasn’t friendly; she acted like the typical rude new yorker. The hotel condition was poor: elevator hardly worked| the room bathroom ceiling coming down| the room ceiling had water stains.,Dec 31| 2017,2
Everything was great| the staff was super professional and helpful| our room was perfect and most important clean. Great location. Definitely i will stay there again.,Dec 31| 2017,5
Booked 2 nights through Expedia (which means no Hilton Honors points) for a 3-day NYC Christmas vacation with son. We wrapped up the first day with a broadway show and on the walk back ate a seemingly innocent Chinese-Thai fusion place. That did it!!! Both of us went down with| what I suspect is| norovirus!!! I was in a bad shape the next day and the following. So was my son| but mostly on the final check out day.  And here is the fun part. I inform them in the morning of the check out day that I may not be able to check out at 12 noon| but may need a couple of extra hours. So they say they can extend until 1300| but will charge half the room rate if I stay until 1500. I ask how much is half day rate and they say $102. Given my circumstances| I agree and say I will play it by ear (meanwhile my son has been throwing up constantly since morning!). So finally we drag ourselves out 1500| I running some fever still and son stumbling his way out. At the check out| they quickly try to process my exit| even asking if I would like a receipt. I say yes and take a peek at it. An extra $150 was added for the 3 extra hours. Nice and smooth work right there!!! I question that and she goes "today's rate"! Lesson learned about NYC style Hilton customer service. Would I go back to this hotel again? Take a guess .,Dec 30| 2017,2
We never knew what we were going to get when it came to staff. Some staff were super friendly. Others acted as though they'd rather be dead than help us. Also| the elevators were constantly not working when we'd get back to the hotel after a long day of adventures. And as someone with an ankle injury| in a room on the 20th floor| stairs were not an option| so we had to wait anywhere from 5 to over 20 minutes for an elevator that functioned to take us up to our room. With such little time in NYC to begin with| wasting nearly 2 hours (total) for the elevator across our trip was not fun| especially after a long day. It was so unpredictable that we had to also leave extra early at the start of each day just to make sure we were not late for our plans.,Dec 29| 2017,3
Nice| convenient| clean. Helpful staff| easy check and check out. May go back again,Dec 28| 2017,4
Not enjoied,Dec 27| 2017,1
The hotel is very comfortable and the location is very good to move around regardless of whether you choose to do that by feet or to take the subway (2 stations nearby). The staff is attentive and they store your luggage if you arrived earlier than expected. The room was super clean and cleaned again daily.,Dec 27| 2017,4
The hotel did not look like it did on the website. The room was small and looked like it had been a very long time since it was cleaned. The curtains were full of dust and we found a live roach in the drawer with the glasses and ice pitcher. The only thing positive that I can say is that the staff were all very friendly and apologetic.,Dec 26| 2017,2
Room was clean and quiet stayed two nights in a 10th floor single king at the back of the building so not facing the street.  Bit of an annoyance was the bathroom door that would never stay open.  This hotel is one of those small hotels squeezed into the streets around Chelsea.  Elevators weren't too bad| there are only 2 of them shared with housekeeping.  29th St around the hotel is not so nice until you get onto 7th Ave| homeless sleeping in doorways| folks smoking in parked cars| and trash everywhere.  I would only stay here for a cheap rate| at high rates there will be better value to be found elsewhere.,Dec 26| 2017,3
Staff was very nice and friendly. Concierge was excellent. Room was ready well before checking time. Room was very clean and beds were comfortable. Bathroom could use a little updating. Hotel location was great.,Dec 23| 2017,4
My husband| two daughters| and I stayed in a room with two full beds. The room was very small| which is to be expected in Manhattan. I guess what I didn’t expect was how small and cramped even the hallways were. We were on the 2nd floor| which is apparently were the hotel staff keeps all of the vacuums. Literally| just in the hallway outside of our room. I think the staff also had a closet on The seconds floor where they kept towels and other supplies. The staff was so loud anytime they were getting supplies. I’m actually not sure if they were exceptionally loud or if the hotel is just so tight and close together that you can hear everything that is going on. I’m a heavy sleeper and can usually sleep through a lot| but I was woken every morning by employees in the hallway. There are two elevators in the hotel. On the last day of our trip one of the elevators broke. We could have taken the stairs| but the entrance to the staircase that goes up to all the floors was only accessible through a locked door on the outside of the building. Only the hotel staff had the key to get in through that door. Sometimes we would use those stairs to go down from our room. The staff would pile trash that needed to be taken out on the landing of the stairs so we would have to squeeze through to trash to get downstairs. Good parts of the hotel: comfy beds| relatively clean rooms| happy staff. I think the problems with this hotel all come from a lack of space.,Dec 22| 2017,2
Good stay; decent price for the accommodations provided . One of two elevators not working taking the stairs was not convenient. Location excellent. Room was small but clean- expected for a New York hotel in this price range.,Dec 22| 2017,4
This hotel was wonderful. It was clean and I can’t express how comfortable the bed was!!! Our check in time was four pm but our room was ready in advance. The room itself was clean and was extremely nice and toasty! Willl definitely be staying here every time I visit nyc!,Dec 17| 2017,5
I really was surprised by this little jewel tucked into the city. Great value and location| hotel is very clean and well kept. The only issue was one of the elevators were down during a very busy weekend| other than that five stars.,Dec 13| 2017,4
The only problem I had was with the elevator.  The hotel had only two elevators and one was under repairs for three of the five days. I experienced extremely  long wait times which was very frustrating. Otherwise I had no other issues with my stay at this hotel.,Dec 12| 2017,4
The hotel rooms are very small and dated. Our stay was okay but I definitely would not stay here again. We paid a high price for a horribly small room. There were many other choices at the high price point.,Dec 11| 2017,4
I did a search of 4 star hotels in NYC.  This is not one| therefore my expectations were obviously not met.  The walls were paper thin| the bed was short (I'm 5'7" and my feet hung over the end of the bed)| there was no mini-refrigerator| the room very small and not attractive.  That said| it was clean and serviceable| the workout room was sufficient| and the people who work there were very kind and helpful..,Dec 11| 2017,3
The room wasn’t clean. Also the rooms are quite small check the sq ft online,Dec 10| 2017,3
Great stay| friendly staff and clean room at a great price,Dec 9| 2017,4
That what was expected|rooms were dirty and uncomfortable|we had to placed our baggage in the bathroom because there wasn't space por them|A 25-floored building and only one elevator found up and other going down|space between walls at exiting the elevator where less than one meter|super super overrated|priced as if was located in the Central Park(fith avenue),Dec 9| 2017,1
the hotel is just fine. The hotel is a bit on the smallish size in regards to lobbies| and hallways.It is fairly well maintained. The elevators are the weak link in the chain of amenities. Only two with no service elevator - consequently there are disappointing waits at peak time of the day.,Dec 7| 2017,3
attention needed to rooms - there was no do not disturb door sign; no back up roll of tp; minimal sugar for the one tea bag,Dec 6| 2017,4
This hotel is very central in Manhattan.. we love to walk| but had subways convenient to us if needed (Penn Station| 28th St) The rooms are ok in size for New York. Staff are friendly & helpful. The only negative is the lift| it needs an upgrade as was constantly breaking down. It wouldn’t deter me from staying here again though.,Dec 6| 2017,4
Disappointed from start to finish. Rude at check-in| terrible mattresses| loud staff in the morning| 30 minutes elevator ride (not enough elevators period)| and no late checkout. The service and attitude was the worst part though| the other things could’ve been looked past.,Dec 5| 2017,2
Rooms were small and bathroom is tiny.  Lobby bar was marginal at best.  The elevator situation was terrible.  However| staff was VERY friendly and accomodating.,Dec 5| 2017,3
Very slow elevators| and only 2 for a 27 story building.The staff was very rude.,Dec 5| 2017,2
My daughter and I were looking for a reasonably priced Manhattan hotel room that was convenient and clean. This place fit the bill perfectly. The beds were super comfortable| the rooms were clean| and the cookies at check-in were awesome. I would definitely stay here again.,Dec 4| 2017,5
Nice hotel 2 minutes walk from Madison Square Gardens and 5 minutes walk from the Empire State Building.  The first impression wasn't great as we arrived at night down what appeared to be a dark alley into a small reception area.  The room was small but immaculately clean with a really comfortable bed which I was loathe to leave.  There is a small bar which was nice after a whole day walking around.  There is also a restaurant which I haven't tried yet but will have breakfast there today.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel.,Dec 4| 2017,4
There were some sketchy characters near the hotel at night,Nov 29| 2017,4
Hotel is nice| rooms very small and elevator takes a long time| should have more elevators,Nov 29| 2017,3

We had a really nice stay at the hotel in February! Got a bit worried reading the reviews before arriving| but in general everyhting was really nice. One of the elevators broke twice during our 15 day-stay| but was repaired quickly. The location of the hotel is superb| near the center and walking distance to many points of interest. Heating and wifi worked. We were on the sixth floor| towards the inner yard and there was no noise. I would say the only minus was the duvet| which had no filling in it| but we did get an extra blanket when asking for it. The hotel is a bit worn out| but had good price-quality.,Mar 3| 2020,4
Sijainti täydellinen vain 10min kävelymatka Times Squarelle.Sisään- ja uloskirjaus sujuivat minuutissa ongelmitta.Henkiläkunta ystävällistä.Aamupala suhteellisen kallis tarjoiluihin verrattuna. Hotellin lähellä on ravintoloita| joista saa halvemmalla paremman aamupalan.Isoin miinus oli huoneen äänieristys. Kaikki kuului käytäviltä| kaduilta ja naapureiden huoneista. Iltaisin varsinkin häiritsi kun kaikki puheet ja telkkarin äänet kuuluivat todella selkeästi huoneeseen.,Feb 19| 2020,4

Lage Lage und nochmals Lage| die Lage des Hotels in der 29St ist Spitze.Ein sehr guter Ausgangspunkt um Manhattan in allen Richtungen zu erkunden. In der Umgebung ist alles bequem per Fuss sehr gut zu erreichen.Das Hotel selbst diente uns als Ausgangspunkt bzw. als Ort des schlafens.In der Lobby gab es zwei Fahrstühle die von den Hausmitarbeitern gerne per Schlüssel exklusiv bedient wurden| so dass erhebliche Wartezeiten entstanden.Der Zimmerservice liess etwas zu wünschen übrig aber war in Ordnung. Die Ausstattung ist in die Jahre gekommen| aber nutzbar.Starker Negativpunkt war der ZimmerSafe ... er stand im Wandschrank und war leider nicht befestigt.Über das Essensangebot (Frühstück) können wir keine Angaben machen| da der Preis nicht gerechtfertigt ist und wir davon abstand genommen hatten. Wir verpflegten uns selbst.Würden wir das Hotel wieder buchen ? Ein eindeutiges "Ja"In Manhattan| war es unser sechster Besuch und das fünfte Hotel,Dec 6| 2019,4

Редко пишу дурные отзывы| но по факту отель совсем не заслуживает положительного. Самое ужасное| что повлияло на отзыв в целом это  состояние номера| ковер грязный и вонючий| из-за этого постоянно стояла вонь в номере| окна открываются на 5 см| как и везде| поэтому проветривать было невозможно. Сам отель старый| завтраки скудные. Зато депозит вернули в течение суток после выселения.Район вроде бы и не плохой| но именно там | у отеля| часто встречались бездомные и всякие неблагоприятные личности.,Oct 16| 2019,3

Ficamos no 1202| quarto espaçoso| cama enorme| frigobar| cafeteira| cofre| banheiro funcional com banheira| muito limpo e sem aquele cheiro de mofo. Fiquei mto bem impressionada| pois tds dizem q os hoteis em NY sao minusculos e| no geral| ruins. Melhor custo benefício. Bem proximo ao Empire State e metro na esquina. Assim q chegamos ja liberaram o quarto| por volta das 13hs| nos deram alguns cookies deliciosos. Tem maquina de refrigerante em alguns andares. A noite o bar realiza happy hour com promocoes de algumas bebidas. Apenas alguns pontos a considerar: sao 2 elevadores apenas| em horarios de pico podem demorar bastante| e ao deixar o hotel| um rapaz do hotel ofereceu ajuda com as malas e shuttle mas eu neguei e ele ficou um pouco bravo. Tirando esses detalhes| a experiencia foi realmente boa.,Oct 10| 2019,5
Für 4 Personen sind die Zimmer viel zu klein Es ist kein Platz für das Gepäck Und auch die Reinigung wurde ab Tag 3 nicht mehr richtig vorgenommen| sondern es lag ein netter Zettel auf dem Bett „man könne das Bett nicht machen“ ... alles in allem war der Aufenthalt „ok“,Oct 7| 2019,3
地下鉄も近く、NY観光にはとても便利でした。建物は古いですが、充分満足でした。ジャワの水圧は、9階でもちょっと弱めな事が残念なところかな。,Sep 18| 2019,4

Gute Lage| viele Attraktionen auch zu Fuß erreichbar| ansonsten Metro nicht weit entfernt. Zimmer sind sehr klein und in Ordnung| wenn auch nicht sensationell. Wir waren zu viert - da hat man nicht viel Platz....und Koffer öffnen geht ganz schlecht....:-) Aber das ist Manhattan! Wir hatten einen sehr guten Übernachtungspreis| von daher Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis in Ordnung. Ich würde es bei entsprechend gutem Preis wieder buchen.,Aug 16| 2019,4

✖︎ヒルトン系列とは言えお粗末な感じしかしませんでした。設備が古く特にエアコンのフィルターは恐らく設置後一度も清掃したことがないのでは？びっくりするくらいのホコリがパッと見の目視でイヤでも確認できるくらい。バスタブはお世辞にも清潔とは言えずレインフォール型のシャワーは湯量、温度共にイマイチでした。◎28th、34th streetの駅からは近く夜遅くなっても怖い思いをせず帰れます。また、周辺には新鮮なフルーツがあるデリ付きスーパーやマクドナルド、メゾンカイヤーなど食べ物には困らなかった。,Nov 23| 2018,2

Mittelklassehotel mit sehr kleinen Zimmern| sauber| gute Betten| vieles neu renoviert. Leider nur zwei Fahrstühle| von denen einer während unseres dreitägigen Aufenthalts an zwei Tagen für mehrere Stunden ausfiel. Dadurch sehr lange Wartezeiten.

Walk distance to Pen Station| very ideal for overnight connecting flight via EWR airport. Other than that| the rest of hotel service is kinda normal. Facilities is a bit outdated and the elevator is a bit slow....,Sep 26| 2018,4
There is a bus stop and a subway station soon.Pennsylvania station is nearby| and access by Kennedy Airport and New Work Airport is also very good by train.,Sep 13| 2018,4
Hotellet var eldre enn det ser ut som på bildene. Dette var i utgangspunktet ikke noe problem| men kombinert med at fellesområdet var rene byggeplassen| ble ikke inntrykket så veldig positivt. Vi ble møtt med flere lass med søppel i inngangsområdet og lobbyen var sperret med stilaser og plastforheng. Arbeidet var også ganske høylytt. Servicen og beliggenhet var egentlig ganske bra| men det kom dessverre litt i skyggen av alt kaoset...,Sep 11| 2018,3
hotel tres bruyant et encombre a cause des travaux de renovation!les chambres sont faites tous les jours |aspirateur sur moquette 1 fois en 10 jours !!,Sep 10| 2018,2
Das Hotel liegt super und Manhattan lässt sich von dort in alle Richtungen erkunden - vieles auch zu Fuß. Frühstücksmöglichkeiten gibt es ausreichend in der Umgebung. Was. Ich optimal war: Wir hatten ein Vier-Bett-Zimmer - zwar mit Blick aufs Empire State Building| aber sehr sehr klein. Es gab keinen Platz| die Koffer abzustellen. Außerdem wurde das Hotel während unseres Aufenthalts renoviert. In der Hotel Lobby sah es chaotisch aus. Wir haben zudem zum Teil ewig auf den Aufzug warten müssen| weil permanent Handwerker und Hotelpersonal ebenfalls damit unterwegs waren. Vielleicht gibt es ja im Normalfall einen dritten Aufzug - wir haben ihn nicht gesehen. Trotzdem können wir das Hotel wegen Lage und Sauberkeit empfehlen.,Sep 1| 2018,3
Bel hôtel et très bien situé au centre ville| mais odeur de cigarette désagréable dans la chambre.,Aug 27| 2018,3

Hotel céntrico. En reformas durante el verano de 2018 (en otoño las finalizarán).,Aug 19| 2018,4
Perfektes Hotel als Ausgangspunkt für einen Städtetripp. Viele Attraktionen wie z.B. Time Sqaure fußläufig zu erreichen. Für NY Verhältnisse bieten die Zimmer viel Platz. Sauberkeit ist in Ordnung. Mein Zimmer hatte einen Teppichboden| der nicht mehr der Neuste war| in anderen Zimmern ist der wohl schon ersetzt. Mein Bett und das Bad waren aber absolut in Ordnung. Jeder Gast sollte sich aber bewusst sein| dass NY auch hinsichtlich der Hotels etwas Besonderes ist. Wer Luxus sucht ist hier falsch. Wer einfach ein sauberes Bett und eine "Basis" für die Erkundung von New York sucht| macht mit dem Hotel nichts falsch. Würde es wieder buchen.,Aug 17| 2018,4

It was the worst stay and experience of all my travels... not recommending this hotel for nothing...,Jul 31| 2018,1
El hotel está en reparación y eso es algo incómodo pero se entiende porque es parte de un proceso de mejora. Los elevadores son muy tardados. La habitación es chica pero cómoda y limpia. Bastante tranquila. Por lo que entiendo| todos los baños tienen características de ¨accesibilidad¨. Es un poco extraño pero no está mal| de una vez todos los cuartos sirven para todo tipo de huésped. Rico el desayuno del hotel pero hay muchas opciones alrededor y mas baratas. El Room service es carísimo. Entre impuestos| cargos por servicio y propina incluida| le aumentaron un 50% adicionales al total de la cuenta. Muy buena ubicación.,Jul 20| 2018,3

Das Hotel hat eine tolle Lage und wurde deshalb von uns ausgesucht! Da wir Chelsea für das optimale Viertel für einen NY Trip halten. Insgesamt entspricht das Hotel dem klassischen  Doubletree Standard| was wir als gut empfinden. Was wir als sehr negativ empfunden haben war zum einen dass der gesamte Eingangsbereich renoviert wurde und somit keinerlei Sitzmöglichkeiten vorm Hotel vorhanden waren! Schlimmer jedoch war dass von 2 Aufzügen nur einer funktioniert hat| da man vom 21. Stock nur bedingt gerne läuft| standen wir pro Fahrt ca 10-15min wartend vorm Aufzug um dann in einem restlos überfüllten Aufzug mit zu fahren! Das gesamte Personal nahm dies komplett gleich gültig zur Kenntnis...was uns auch etwas negativ aufgestoßen ist!Aber abgesehen vom Personal und dem Beschriebenen ist das Hotel mitten in NY allein wegen der Lage zu empfehlen!,May 6| 2018,3

Séjour de 3 jours. Hotel localisé tout près d'une station de métro et de plusieurs restaurants et commerces d'alimentation. Situé à distance de marche des principales attractions: Times Square| Central Park et même le World Trade Center pour les plus en forme. Chambre petite| un peu désuète mais propre et avec une excellente literie et un poste de télévision de bonne dimension. Pour un léger supplément| on peut aussi avoir vue sur l'Empire State Building| situé à proximité. À part les inévitables bruits de portes qui claquent et les personnes qui ne peuvent pas s'empêcher de parler fort dans les corridors| même tard| j'avoue que les chambres entre elles sont bien insonorisées et que nous y avons fort bien dormi. Personnel courtois et discret: merci pour le traditionnel biscuit à l'arrivée et le bon entretien des chambres. J'ajoute le tarif plus que raisonnable du stationnement publique juste en face de l'entrée à 33.$ US/jour: ne pas oublier de faire tamponner le carton de stationnement avant de quitter l'hôtel pour bénéficier de ce tarif préférentiel.,Mar 12| 2018,4

Foi excelente a estadia no DoubleTree Chelsea| muito bem localizado| atendentes sempre atenciosos.Café da manhã é caro| acabei optando por comer todos os dias fora do hotel.Recomendo para quem quer pagar menos é está próximo dos principais cartões-postais de Nova Iorque.,Jan 31| 2018,5
Nice hotel| rooms are not so big but clean and comfortable. You can ask for the room with the Empire view that's wonderful. Everything is walking distance| the staff is very kind. It's a place where I'll come back again.,Jan 27| 2018,4

Rummet var fint med lite små skador här och där. Inget jag brydde mig om då personalen var fantastisk under alla omständigheter! Super bra läge för den som gillar mysiga södra delar av Manhattan och alla bra shopping gator längs avernyerna. Utgångspunkten är grym på alla sätt med nära till det mesta och lagom promenad avstånd för den som vill se manhattan.,Jan 16| 2018,5
Hôtel très bien situé à environ 10 minutes à pied de Times Square.Toutefois déçu du service par rapport au standing de l’hotel : ménage pas fait une nuit| ascenseur peu efficace| compter parfois 20 minutes juste pour descendre 5 étages. Salle de sport toute petite et très mal équipée. Chambre petite mais literie très confortable. Personnel sympathique et cookie de bienvenue très appréciable.Tarif spécial pour le parking de la rue très intéressant.,Jan 15| 2018,5
When we arrived there were no reservation for us so we recieved an other room. It did not meet the standard we had booked. The cleaning was not so good| l lot of dust in the corners and the bahroom was freezing cold. The heating was very noise.

Meine Mutter und ich waren im Dezember 2017 dort. Das Zimmer ist völlig in Ordnung und auch super sauber. Nur die Heizung ist unglaublich laut. Für Leute die einen nicht ganz so tiefen Schlaf haben| werden aufwachen wenn die Heizung anspringt. Man kann sie auch komplett ausschalten| dann kühlt das Zimmer aber recht schnell aus.,Dec 23| 2017,4
O lobby do hotel precisa de uma reforma| muito antigo. A frente do hotel estava suja. O quarto é confortável| mas o banheiro ainda não têm box de vidro| continua com a banheira e a cortina| muito ruim. Excelente localização| mas pelo preço da diária deixa a desejar.,Dec 21| 2017,3

I loved this property and will definitely stay there again! Every single staff was helpful and friendly! My view was immaculate and the size of the room fit my needs. Close to everything and easy access to taxis and Ubers. I do however| wish there was an over night kitchen or mini store for toiletries and snacks.  Even a microwave to reheat leftover meals or if I bring my children next time. Other than that I have no complaints and I recommend this hotel to everyone especially Californians who are used to spacious hotels.,Aug 3| 2021,5

I like the location| but the amenities were very limited. I can’t believe it| the first hotel that I have stayed that “SELLS ICE CUBES “Hmmm very disappointing….,Jul 26| 2021,3
Though the reservation was for a room with two double beds| the only room offered had a couple of twin beds!,Jul 26| 2021,2
This was my favorite hotel to stay in pre-Covid. Unfortunately now much has changed and not for the better. First| there is no hotel valet! As everyone knows around the hotel is UN parking and it is impossible to find find parking| so the lack of valet is a huge inconvenience. The clock/music player was outdated and not functioning well. When I called down to have it replaced I was brought an even older version. And finally I was told there were no functioning icemakers in the hotel| and if I wanted ice I had to go down to the ground level to the café and purchase ice by the cup or the bag. I was literally charged five dollars for a tiny bag of ice that could fit in the palm of my hand. Was disappointing because this hotel is beautiful and I absolutely love the views so hoping that they consider changing these things in the future,Jul 25| 2021,2
Very clean and extremely new and high tech hotel.,Jul 23| 2021,5

Overall a very nice hotel with city view rooms. They were cleaned daily and the cafe had a nice variety of snacks| drinks| and coffee. Staff was friendly. Wish there were more amenities to enjoy| but it is perfect for a weekend getaway if you already live in NYC.,Jul 20| 2021,4
Room was clean and spacious. Absolutely nice view | very nice and accommodating Staff . Felt safe in surrounding neighborhood.,Jul 20| 2021,4
I was disappointed. The building is in poor condition--tears and holes in the carpet in the hallway and in my room.  The bathroom door had large spots of peeling paint and brown spots on it. The website/signage tout their restaurant and room service and neither were available still claiming because of covid (although the surrounding area is full of open restaurants) and they had no icemakers. If I had known this I would have stayed elsewhere.,Jul 20| 2021,2

Hotel was quiet| and immaculate| as far as cleanliness.Highly recommend. Staff is courteous and attentive to all requests.,Jul 12| 2021,5
The view from the room and location was good. Lot of places nearby to eat out. The staff was generally nice (meets expectations). But it is an old hotel with hardly any space in the lobby. Lots of mirrors to hide the space problems (pictures on the site are deceptive). I could see ants crawling in the room| linens were oldish and bit soiled. Ratings on Expedia do not reflect reality. Maybe they invested to get the ratings improved artificially...Not sure. Would not recommend the price.,Jul 12| 2021,2
Not friendly staff,Jul 11| 2021,3
Service was bare bones. The room was visibly dirty- fingerprints on mirrors in room and bathroom| lamp shade badly spiked and ripped| furniture badly chipped| in room safe locked| no doormen anywhere upon check out| lobby furniture looked very tired- table broken. Housekeeping dept. was very helpful when I realized forgot my hanging clothes.,Jul 11| 2021,2
It was a terrible experience| when i checked in i was given a dirty room| which was not yet cleaned after a previous guest. The service was very bad.,Jul 10| 2021,1

The rooms are nice and big. Comfortable. The staff is OK (except for one exceptional doorman). No ice available except in the store downstairs where you pay almost $5 dollars for a half a bag of small ice. Disappointing for a hotel of this category.,Jul 6| 2021,3

Beautiful inside| but wine bottles were left in the lounging area for several hours,Jun 28| 2021,3
Spacious and inviting... Clean and and room smells good. Nice ambience but the staff needs more effort to be friendly,Jun 26| 2021,4
Rooms were clean and updated. Coffee maker was dirty.  The view from both rooms was worth it for us| first time in NY.  The location and it's surroundings were peaceful and lots of stores for personal items and food within walking distance.  Service at the hotel was great and welcoming.,Jun 23| 2021,4
Everything,Jun 21| 2021,5
Such an amazing city view! Very nice room. We will be staying here again!,Jun 21| 2021,5
Great location,Jun 20| 2021,5
Since 9/11 the front desk personnel have s more military/police attitude. I understand the need for security except most hotels in NY manage to do it more subtly. Front desk should be staffed by people that make you feel welcome after a long trip. Also| restaurant was closed. No room service. No gym. Not even a bottle of water. Room and views were exceptional as always reminding me of why this used to be my favorite hotel in NY.,Jun 19| 2021,4
Staff was amazing!,Jun 18| 2021,5
Not sure I'll stay at this hotel again. Overrated for its price and surly reception staff who were not at all helpful. No fridge in the room and the carpets were dirty. Couldn't recommend it.,Jun 17| 2021,1
Nice and clean property across from the UN building. We had one of the best rooms- the corner room on the 34th floor with panoramic views of the entire city. We thoroughly enjoyed the coffee and specialty drinks on property that served illy coffee. Each staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful in providing recommendations for food| coffee| and things to do in the area as this was our first time in NYC. The property is a short walk to grand central station| which can take you anywhere in the city and surrounding areas.,Jun 17| 2021,5
Nothing is open here on property and there is no valet or garage on site... Have been visiting mid-town area for 10 years and usually stay at Hyatt.. made huge mistake staying here. The bell man knew there was a lot of issues because he handed managers card Matthew who I emailed several times before this review and got zero response. If your going to pay NYC hotel rates you should find better property| this hotel will leave you feeling really aggravated. Really disappoint in this Hilton and WILL NOT STAY HERE IN FUTURE.,Jun 13| 2021,1
Cost-effectively it's a good place.,Jun 12| 2021,4
When we arrived we found trash and someone's bag under our bed| moved rooms and found even more trash under the next bed. First room had something that looked like dried blood or makeup of some sort all over curtains and a large pee stain on mattress. Also found a lot of hair in bed. Their little shop was only open on Fri-Sun so you cannot get any drinks or food in hotel. There is no ice either| when I asked for some they told me to walk down to 45th st and ask the deli at 10:30pm. Wi-Fi is also $15 a day. The first rooms windows was at a slant and filthy| but the second room we had a excellent view.,Jun 10| 2021,3
Clean.  Not quite squeaky like the previous times I've stayed there| but still very clean indeed.  Beds and linen super comfortable.  Shower curtain smelled sour.  Management took care of it right away.,Jun 8| 2021,4
The only thing that didnt work was the main shower head that was it other then that beautiful,Jun 7| 2021,4
I was happy the way the front door worker Paul help us when the room was not clean. Everything else was perfect| spacious room| the air conditioning is quiet| their pillows are great!,Jun 7| 2021,4
Thank you for the stay,Jun 6| 2021,5
no concerige-no breakfast or dining service,Jun 4| 2021,2
What i didn't like was| the room looks like a cheap $80. Short stay. The room very dusty| especially the lamps in the room. No towels| huge hole in the carpet for one outlet. The shower sliding door was so dirty and the air vent is clogged up with dust from the past 12 years. The little refrigerator doesn't even get cold| well the note they wrote inside says it all. And someone covered up the carbon monoxide sensor with cloth and tape| very bad| never again.,Jun 4| 2021,2
The location of this hotel was great. The hotel gives you a sense of safety. The staff was nice| especially the doorman Frank. The only thing I did not like was the room size. The  photos online for the room type I selected were misleading. I would say this hotel is family friendly as well.,Jun 4| 2021,4
Nothing,Jun 3| 2021,1
Just spacious,Jun 2| 2021,5
Closed restaurant. Dirty shower curtain. Stained carpet. Blinds were half off the hook and couldn't close completely.,Jun 2| 2021,1
No food service  at all and no bellman service and limited  housekeeping.  If they don’t want to supply services they should close,May 31| 2021,1
I like the customer service Mr. Philip,May 31| 2021,4
The views in this hotel are AMAZING. The area felt safe. There are restaurants in walking distance. Times Square & Central park were about a 15 min walk away. The hotel has no parking and the lots are kimd of expensive of you’re not a NY resident. The residents are used to the cost. If you can aboid using a car. Do that. The only complaint I had was that due to COVID the ice machines are unavailable (understandable). But| making guest pay almost $4 for a tiny bag of ice was a turnoff. The hotel I stayed at the day before this one had the same situation but? They didn’t make guests pay for ice that will melt in 3 mins anyway 😩.,May 29| 2021,5
Hotel was an excellent location. Close enough to walk to everything in the city but far enough from the business of time square area. Staff was very friendly and helpful,May 29| 2021,4
Good  pleasure,May 28| 2021,4

The site stated in door tennis and breakfast included but when I got there they told none of them was available including No room service | no ice and no cafe .... it was waste of money and STAY !,May 18| 2021,1
Very nice place the view of the city was amazing definitely will stay there again,May 17| 2021,5

Amazing stay! Will be back!,Apr 29| 2021,5
Great hotel| not the nicest lobby but rooms were very nicely sized and TV had all the Netflix| Hulu| YouTube/apps you’d need. Not to mention the bidet built into the toilet was a nice touch.,Apr 29| 2021,5
No complaints nice hotel good service,Apr 28| 2021,5
Best hotel| view was amazing and staff was so nice made me feel like home.,Apr 27| 2021,5
may have to park in garage up the street| can get expensive.,Apr 27| 2021,5
pretty scary place. no personal lock on the door and the window kept opening throughout the night scary the living spirit outta me.,Apr 26| 2021,1
Our stay at this hotel was very beautiful with the city view. The only complaints i have is the windows not being clean and due to our room being RIGHT next to the elevator| you could the elevator right through the walls. Even while being in the shower the wall shakes a little. Other than those two complaints the bed was very comfy and we enjoyed out stay.,Apr 26| 2021,5
Everything in my room except the was bad except the bed my refrigerator didn't work so the staff brought an extra fridge but it was a freezer & it frozed all my things & the extra 1 stayed & took so much space the heat wouldn't work the bath tub wouldn't stop running i have pictures & video & i paid so much for very low to no service,Apr 25| 2021,1
-,Apr 25| 2021,5
The view and the staff were amazing but the room could be cleaned better.,Apr 25| 2021,4
The view was worth everything,Apr 24| 2021,4
It would have been helpful to know up front that there was no room service and no room cleaning during my stay.,Apr 23| 2021,1
The hotel was amazing. I booked a city view and had views on both side of my room! One side was the Empire State building and the other looked over the river. So beautiful at night! The cafe downstairs had just opened back up this past weekend so good timing. The hotel was safe| clean and everyone was very nice. I would definitely book this hotel again on my next stay!,Apr 20| 2021,5
The place was super clean and had a  beautiful view to the city.,Apr 19| 2021,5
Squeaky clean. Comfortable.  Convenient. My only gripe is that the fridge had been removed from my room.,Apr 19| 2021,4
The view was great! Staff was very nice. Perfect distance from night life,Apr 19| 2021,5
Lots of food options,Apr 18| 2021,4
The view was amazing!!! The beds were super comfortable! They didn't e a n under the beds though!! Everything else was great!,Apr 18| 2021,5
The room was decent and had a fabulous view. I was surprised by the fancy toilets they have. I would recommend,Apr 17| 2021,4
Great place to stay!,Apr 17| 2021,5
Horrible experience. Rude staff. Due to COVID| no room service. Compromise on standards| but no compromise on price. Quality comes at a price.  If you guys can’t provide a good service hiding behind COVID| price has to be less too.  Staffs are really really rude,Apr 16| 2021,1
The view on the 40th floor was amazing and the room was perfect. The only dislike was the cleanliness... it could be much better,Apr 13| 2021,4
The room I had on the 34th floor was nice. The view was amazing and beds were comfy. Staff was very nice. Only thing that bothered me a bit was a weird smell in the hallways. The carpet outside the rooms could use a bit of a cleaning but other than that my room was perfect.,Apr 13| 2021,4
Mostly enjoyed the view| was close to airport| bed was very comfy...slept like a baby.,Apr 13| 2021,5
Bad,Apr 12| 2021,1
Too old and dirty nothing pleasant even the lobby on my floor too dark will never stay here again,Apr 11| 2021,1
Dark and damp smelling halls| rooms are only cleaned when requested 24 hours in advance| far from Times Square,Apr 8| 2021,2
nothing,Apr 7| 2021,5
The corner room had an AmAzInG view! Beautiful  view of the Hudson on one side and the city on the other. BUT the tub was a slow drain so it had standing water and couch had seen many better days with the lumps and cigarette burn.,Apr 7| 2021,3
I would have liked parking. Online it said valet parking but there was none so I had to pay for off site parking,Apr 6| 2021,4
Viviona the Duty Manager @ Millennium Hilton New York One In Plaza Customer service was horrible she was not Polite she didn’t smile and when I ask questions about a situation I had she told me conversations over as if she wanted me to be quite I will be calling to speak to corporate,Apr 6| 2021,1
I liked the location| size of the room| comfort of the bed and pillows| nice linens| view| helpful staff| room condition.The room air was stale when we first checked in but after 24 hours| the room had a better smell.  The hallway carpet looked pretty bad and I was surprised that a Hilton Hotel would not change that.,Apr 5| 2021,4
Nothing,Apr 5| 2021,5
It was ok was an unexpected deposit n room wasn’t clean,Apr 5| 2021,4
Good stay. Favorite hotel because of the views.,Apr 5| 2021,4
I don’t like that fact that there’s no where to get food from,Apr 4| 2021,5
Hotel is worth the price. Good stay. Cant complain,Apr 4| 2021,4
Beautiful hotel. I was disappointed when they said there was no valet parking or carts to use to bring our stuff up to the room as there were 4 of us. The lady who checked us in was very short and cold she seemed frustrated.  However the gentelman who checked us out was on point. Everything worked itself out.,Apr 3| 2021,5
No amenities available due to COVID| this should be told before booking,Apr 2| 2021,1
stains on the carpet| pillow didnt smell clean.,Apr 2| 2021,2
I liked how beautiful the lobby looked. My room wasn’t as clean as I expected it to be.,Apr 1| 2021,3
I stayed in this hotel 4 years ago. It was amazing. Now I will give it 0 stars if I get a chance.,Mar 29| 2021,1
The hotel room I had 1King Deluxe with a view was very small and intimate which I enjoyed| the view was stunning of course. I however didn’t like the lack of services and amenities| The lights in the bathroom didn’t work| the wifi service wasn’t THE best| there was no microwave| food service| nor vending machines available| nor was there any sort of housekeeping. So just be prepared for those things ahead nonetheless the stay was ok,Mar 29| 2021,3
The view from my room was beautiful| the room itself was not bad. The bathroom was also nice| shower very nice good pressure hot water. The issue I had was that housekeeping did not come once in the two nights that I was there. The sheets and pillowcase had a slight scent to it it| didn't appear dirty but it seems like it wasn't washed well enough. other than that the room was clean. And the other issue I did have was that the grill/restaurant that's in the hotel was closed and I was not made aware of that. I had waited till about nine to eat dinner thinking I was going to go downstairs and eat and then when I got down there there was a sign on the door that said it was closed temporarily for unknown reasons. The staff did not inform me that the restaurant was closed and I had anticipated going to eat dinner and have drinks there th.at evening but was disappointed when I got down there and the door was locked| before closing hours. Overall this day was decent.,Mar 29| 2021,4
the hotel is beautiful| the view from my room was amazing. The elevators seemed to be needing some work they are very loud and squeaky. The lobby and the rooms were supper clean and had lots of storage to put clothes and other items.,Mar 29| 2021,5
The room and view nice area lot to do around the hotel,Mar 29| 2021,5
The only issue we was that the clock on the main control temperature control unit was off by an hour and half witch had us get up and check out too early.,Mar 29| 2021,4
The view was beautiful only problem I had was the WiFi but other than that everything was awesome,Mar 29| 2021,5
Hotel is dark and uninviting. Hallways are dark. Rooms are not sound proof. Beds were squeaking and broken. Very uncomfortable sleep. Was given a joined room with the door only blocked by a desk and could hear every word of the next door neighbor. Shower door leaks water onto the floor causing slippery floor into the hallway of the bathroom. Windows are small so not much of a view. Under the beds were not fully cleaned. Hard to work TV remote. Towels did not smell clean. Everything was wrong with this stay.,Mar 28| 2021,2
Bathtub was dirty| lots of noise at night.Lots of kids sharing rooms which I wasn’t expecting for a millennium.  Went to ask the front desk for a few things on our way out for the day. Nobody in line but she was cleaning something and didn’t look up. When I said excuse me she said I’ll be right with you I’m cleaning something. I waited about a minute and said never mind. Had another poor experience with the front desk when I called. It’s as if you are bothering them. WillNever stay at millennium again. We were very disappointed.’.,Mar 28| 2021,2
Be aware the hotel is not able to hold your luggage for you if you are planning to go out before your flight out.,Mar 28| 2021,2
This was a great clean hotel with an amazing view. I would definitely stay there again.,Mar 26| 2021,5
The view was incredible from our room.  But there was a construction work jn the lobby and little bit confusing when you enter the hotel. The bed was comfortable but there was a little bit of wnite flour kind of dust inside the sheets| not sure why.. also the towels had wholes anf bathroom floor was extremly dirty| all hair all around. Like extremely dirty bathroom floor and under the chair in the room there was someone's underwear left. So basically thr cleanliness wise| the room was a disaster and i would not stay in this hotel again. It is the shame as the view was incredible.,Mar 24| 2021,3
My flight was leaving late and the staff accommodated me with no issues. The rooms could be cleaned better and the sofa was stained. I enjoyed my stay.,Mar 23| 2021,5
Everything was great i had no complaints thank you for a wonderful stay,Mar 23| 2021,5
They should invest in smoking rooms & rooms with balcony,Mar 22| 2021,5
Definitely overpriced for the aesthetic of the facility. Rooms are likely renovated yet the rest of the facility is outdated. The shower was super slippery. One elevator has issues closing and going up. Staff was friendly only spoke to staff at check in/out. Not sure if it’s because we booked through Expedia but the incidentals fee is pretty high. It’s the highest fee we had to pay at $225. 3/5,Mar 22| 2021,3
The carpets were stained and dirty. Room doesn’t even resemble what is shown on the picture. They used the pandemic as an excuse not to even have ice for self service ice machine when other hilton hotels offer it. No cleaning service while you stay there| after you check in you are pretty much on your own. And just when you thought things could not get any worse| a prankster decided to turn on the fire alarm at 2am.,Mar 22| 2021,1
Great set up in room and easy to access around hotel except that Our room was missing ice buckets| bathroom fan| and the walls are not sound proof so you could hear your neighbors discussion.,Mar 22| 2021,3
No frills easy check in procedure with no amenities available.,Mar 22| 2021,4
The bedroom looked exactly how it looks in the picture. Great location. 10/10 recommend.,Mar 22| 2021,5
The weed smokers outside were not a pleasant sight to see. And what hotel doesn’t have ice?,Mar 21| 2021,2
No hay microondas| no hay refrigerador|no hay bloguer para secado del cabello |el servicio para limpiar y hacer la habitación lo debes de ordenar 24 horas antes si no no tienes ni toallas limpias al segundo día de estancia no tienes facilidad de comprar ni agua dentro del hotel |nesecite ordenar por Amazon groceries no pude hacer uso de internet |se disparó la alarma de incendio y nadie respondía en la recepción luego de 6 minutos confirmaron que era falsa alarma |entre en panico| Salí un día antes de lo programado en mi opinión es HORRIBLE,Mar 21| 2021,1
I loved the location but very dissappointes in the over fall staff and service. Staff wasRude| when I requested roomService I was told i need to give 24 hrs notice. I was unaware of such thing. I was given bedding to do the bed myself. No iron boards in room. Luggage rack was broken. Found items in room from previous stay. The whole hotel smelled of marijuana smoke! Staff at front counter was impolite and unfriendly. I totally regret the stay and disappointed that Hilton would allow this!,Mar 20| 2021,2
The room that we booked was with a bath tub and it’s wasnt what we get...they gave us a stand up shower,Mar 20| 2021,3
Excelente. Solo necesita estacionamiento. Estamos muy complacidos.,Mar 20| 2021,5
The room was immaculate clean enough space very modernized the city view was fantastic,Mar 20| 2021,5
I was staying for 4 days and they never cleaned my room.  I had to go every day to ask for clean towels| soap| glasses for coffee| etc.  I do not recommend it.  they do not provide any service.,Mar 19| 2021,1
Beautiful view super clean room friendly staff ...,Mar 18| 2021,5
Beautiful room,Mar 17| 2021,5
I stayed 4 nights..the front desk lady is rude like if she doing you a favor for staying there..the first room smelled like straight cigarettes so I asked to be moved to a better room which they did..had a good view and clean room after I asked...they don’t have water to give..overall it was Ok but I wouldn’t go there again on my next trip,Mar 16| 2021,3
The room was nice with a nice view in the corner. What i was worry about was the room wasn't cleaned was dust by the coffee station|but the rest so far was good.,Mar 15| 2021,5
ve close r y frendly stufftion and cline posishen of the hotel is exselent,Mar 15| 2021,5
Good location . The lobby is really dated with the fake flowers-not a good look. The carpet in my room had a lot of wear.,Mar 15| 2021,3
Highly recommend the city view rooms. they definitely don’t disappoint 😊,Mar 14| 2021,5
The best thing in there was the housekeeping lady the best and the guy bring the fridge to our room because no fridge in the room when we check inMore than that checking that I was rude to secure people route the room cleaning now from 0 to 5 and give them one,Mar 14| 2021,2
We were upgraded to a King XL bedroom| amazing city views| comfortable bed and brand new bathroom.,Mar 14| 2021,4
I was disappointed with this place. First off| all the positive reviews I read here gave me high hopes of the place. The cleanliness does not exist. Thankfully my family and I brought our own wipes and disinfectant spray that we had  to clean the whole room ourselves. There was dust everywhere| hair all over the couch| and dirt/dust on every counter. It did not feel clean when we walked in. Also| this hotel seems to be ok with people having parties in their rooms. The room next to ours was blasting music at 3am until 7am. My family and I couldn’t sleep all night. It was very disappointing given the location it’s at. One would think the rooms would be pristine clean or even the whole hotel. The carpet walking up to our rooms were so dirty. It was just gross to look at. Also the staff was not friendly whatsoever. I don’t plan to stay here again.,Mar 14| 2021,2
Beautiful view| the rooms are very nice. Only thing is the shower curtains sometimes smell weird and the rug isn’t vacuumed,Mar 14| 2021,5
The view was amazing! My only complaint would be a bit so clean room. I did report it but they did nothing but say they will inform the manager. Overall good!,Mar 14| 2021,2
The hotel is very nice and has a great view. None of the special accommodations I requested were offered so I am not sure why they asked. There is also no onsite parking which sucked. But there is street parking if you come after 7pm around the corner. The hotel is clean and the particular room I picked was huge. Definitely worth the money. Coming off the elevator though there was a bleach stain that tracked all the way to our room which was pretty far. Other than that| no complaints. I would recommend staying here in a corner King room so you get the best views.,Mar 13| 2021,4
Could not sleep all night bc too much like too much noise too loud every thing in building top of that they charge my account money also very mad very bad experience pay for parking also 😡,Mar 11| 2021,1
Loved the view from my room. Loved the fact that there was a hand held shower head. Would have appreciated a microwave in my room.,Mar 11| 2021,5
The room was dirty and had stains on the towels in acceptable. I came to stay for the night and couldn’t walk on the carpet because I had no slippers. I thought hotels came equipped with that,Mar 11| 2021,3
The room was disgusting. Stains all around the room in suspicious spots. Then the staff was rude when I was checking in. I had an issue with my wifi(that I paid for) and they didn’t even attempt to help me.,Mar 11| 2021,1
Room with a view indeed! Corner room with spectacular| unobstructed views was breathtaking. Very clean. Friendly staff| most helpful| a few not so much. CONS: Website did not reflect that valet parking was not an option. Only said valet parking only. Tried calling the hotel multiple times in a week| never got an answer.,Mar 10| 2021,4
We had amaizing view from corner room on 35th floor. Pros was pillows smell and insufficient ventilation in the bathroom. Overall we had a great experience.,Mar 9| 2021,4
The shower didn’t work and no one did a thing about it. Still paid the full price.,Mar 9| 2021,2
My original room was small and dated. As I really wanted to feel being in the city that never sleeps I wanted  to see the lights of the grandest buildings in the world. I went down to reception and I was upgraded to a fabulous room which provided views of all the great buildings. Thank you Barry for your care and fine spirit.,Mar 9| 2021,4
Service was excellent! Our room was beautiful and very tidy! I will definitely be returning.,Mar 8| 2021,5
Amazing .It Was Our Anniversary Stay. (The View Was The Best Part Of The Stay).I Mean Besides The Room Having Some Trouble| They Offered To Switch Unit Instantly. The Cleaners Came Right Away To Fix The Issues. I Mean This Hotel Was On Point| Staff Is Friendly| They Make You Feel Home!,Mar 8| 2021,4
Good location. Clean.  10 min walk to grand central,Mar 8| 2021,3
I didn't like you had to call housekeeping the night before so they can clean the room they should be on site 24/7,Mar 8| 2021,3
The only bummer is that the cafe/bar/restaurant is closed because of covid (not the hotels fault) I liked that there was always people by the door making sure there wasn't anyone hanging around who shouldn't be| and the elevator only works to go up to the rooms if you swipe a room key| so it's very safe. The room was gorgeous and very clean. The closet was huge| I could walk into it. We had a beautiful view.,Mar 7| 2021,5
The view and room was not what we booked but it was ok for just one night,Mar 7| 2021,4
would like an open restaurant or vending machines.,Mar 7| 2021,5
Staff were very rude| did not want to answer any questions,Mar 7| 2021,1
rooms were pretty small| but the view was beautiful at night and at sunrise. one thing i had a problem with is when i came in the room there was gunk on some of the towels| garbage still in the trash bin| and hair was all around the room. they obviously didn't clean. since we're still at risk of a virus| it's unacceptable.,Mar 6| 2021,3
Stood for 3 days and couldn’t sleep because there was a lot of noise inside the walls,Mar 6| 2021,1
Staff at reception wasn’t friendly. No complimentary items.,Mar 5| 2021,3
Amazing,Mar 4| 2021,5
Very nice place to stay with an incredible view. Room service wasn’t too great but overall it was nice.,Mar 3| 2021,4
The hotel room floor was so dirty it had stains and was not very clean i had to clean myself,Mar 3| 2021,3
That was unpleasant place to stay!I was very disappointed!,Mar 2| 2021,1
I had been to this hotel over 6 times and this was the first time I was truly disappointed to begin with our room wasn't properly cleaned there was trash under the beds stains on the shower curtain. Not all lights functioned one was broken that it fell on me. The refrigerator was broken and they replaced it with another broken one. And to top it off I had to park on the street because there no longer is hotel parking. And to top it off the floor we were on was chaotic music blaring till late night people screaming drunk through the hallway. Needless to say Highly disappointed to say the least we will not be visiting this hotel again,Mar 2| 2021,2
No parking at all. They recommend a garage a 5 min walk away but they can be pretty expensive. My sheets were dirty| seems like it wasn’t washed . Had makeup on it,Mar 2| 2021,2
Well for starters| I was given a room to where it wasn't cleaned well at all. I call the front desk and reported it| they seemed as if they were disappointed and even offered to send house keeping| though they Never came. We needed wash clothes stated that as well| still nothing. Even when I called the next morning still nothing. The floors where a mess| furniture wasn't cleaned off like it should have been| this experience was very disappointing! The shower didn't work (the large one) the hand held did.hair was everywhere in the tub on the floor| Even on the shelf to were the shampoo and conditioner was held. The refrigerator wasn't cold| I'm just so disappointed with establishment!  I remember staying here many years ago with American Red cross| for work in a suite and the service was steller as well as the view. It never crossed my mind that this establishment has gone down hill to this! Also| I was never even offered a new room. It's a shame we had to leave out and get cleaning solutions to make things right for our family! Yes| you can say I'm Absolutely pissed.,Mar 2| 2021,1
Staff was not friendly at all.Place wasn’t clean| a lot of dust all over.They don’t have a vending machine in the property.Long line for checking in once we got the Room  we asked for a room upgrade| the manager asked us to make the line again. Nobody was helpful.,Mar 1| 2021,2
You can see the UN building and the EmpireStates Building. Beautiful night view.Easy to access the Grand Central Station.,Mar 1| 2021,4
The property was really clean the only problem is I paid for a room with a city view the windows you cant open them and there were too small. My partner and me we cant even enjoy the view. Overall it wasn't that bad,Mar 1| 2021,5
The hotel is very nice and the view from our room was absolutely amazing | but our room could have been cleaned better. The mini fridge was dirty| it had hair stuck on the inside. Also| the gentlemen that greeted us at the door were quite pleasant but the woman that checked us in was very “dry”. She wasn’t rude| she just wasn’t friendly either.,Feb 28| 2021,3
The room was a nice size and very clean. We stayed on the 35th floor and had a nice view.,Feb 28| 2021,4
This location is just simply immaculate. The upkeep| presentation| hospitality for the most part and amenities are just superb!,Feb 28| 2021,5
They charged my card $14.95 when my stay was already paid for through Expedia| when I called I was told that the charge was for the internet which I never used.After deliberation with the rude and condescending clerk| she agreed to refund the $14.95.She was rudely letting me know that all hotels in New York charges for wifi.,Feb 27| 2021,1
Impeccable cleanliness.  Good| firm beds. Pleasant furnishing.  Loved the couch.,Feb 26| 2021,4
Nobody goes to clean the room in 3 nights | no ice in the hotel|,Feb 24| 2021,5
Nice room but it should be more appealing but overall my stay was good,Feb 24| 2021,4
The location. The view was amazing! I will stay again,Feb 22| 2021,5
I expected a better view than what I got.  The front desk person looked annoyed to be attending anyone and didn't even crack a smile.  What I hated the most was you could hear everyone outside the room since the room was by the elevators.  For most of the night just seemed like people where just hanging out in the halls.,Feb 22| 2021,3
I didn’t like that security is at the door with dogs. Was there for two days.  Didn’t have room services to come clean room.,Feb 22| 2021,3
Everything was appealing to me i loved my stay from the entrance to checking in to entering the room and leaving,Feb 22| 2021,5
The property was spacious| clean| quiet and absolutely lovely,Feb 22| 2021,5
This hotel was absolutely filthy and rundown. It looks nothing like the pictures online. I took pictures of the hotel conditions and checked out immediately after checking in. Do not stay here! The carpets were stained| the hotel room had hair and filth all over the floor| the furniture was run down and looked like it was from good will. The carpet had not been vacuumed for weeks. Gross place,Feb 22| 2021,1
Amazing views! I would recommend to anyone in nyc. River views and city views. Stay in a corner room,Feb 21| 2021,5
I loved loved loved the view and how everything looked from the top. The room was the perfect size and even the bathroom was gorgeous!,Feb 21| 2021,4
Me encanto súper amables y bien con placenteros. Yo no hablo inglés y ellos tratan de ayudarte en lo más posible me gusto le doy 100 estrellitasss,Feb 21| 2021,5
it was a very nice stay. we stayed 4 days for valentine’s day weekend. the staff was very nice and they had strict covid rules so you felt safe. honestly no problems there. i only gave four stars bc the elevators took forever to come and i wish they would’ve had some sort of concierge service with snacks or even water. if you wanted those thing you had to do doordash or uber eats which cost so much. they could have made a lot of money from that weekend alone if they offered that and just left it at the door.,Feb 20| 2021,4
The room was a nice size and the views were beautiful. The hotel is close to everything and it was very convenient. We came to NY to celebrate my daughters 11th Birthday. It’s been her dream to see snow and see NY. When checking in I believe his name was Barry (I wish I could for sure remember his name) he was Exceptionally kind. He really made our stay. Everyone was very accommodating and kind. It was a wonderful experience and will definitely be back!,Feb 20| 2021,5
No ice|  or water.... it's in a area far from stores... staff was kind and helpful,Feb 20| 2021,3
The room honestly looked like someone was just in it like it didn’t feel or look like a fresh room there was a brownish red stain on the bed sheet and on top of that I dropped my brush and it went under the bed and I just saw garbage under the bed as if nobody cleans under there or they just sweep the mess under there but this wouldn’t be the first time cause I booked a room on Valentine’s Day as well and because I was decorating the room a bit I was on the floor and just saw bottles and cans all under the bed. I’ve been to this hotel 4 times now and I can Honestly say this stay has to be the most nastiest stay I had thus far.,Feb 20| 2021,4
Very nice hotel got a feee upgrade from the man at the front desk,Feb 20| 2021,5
The hotel room was better then I imagined. Beautiful view of the water and awesome double floor bedroom,Feb 19| 2021,5
Glad it remain limited contact during times of the pandemic. Unfortunately it didn’t allow for a lot of the hotel’s services to operate as usual.,Feb 19| 2021,5
I didn’t like the fact that I walked into my room that was not cleaner or prepared for me even after booking in advance and then still coming after my check in time and completing the check in process before looking for parking.,Feb 17| 2021,2
I had a great stay at this hotel no complaints at all.,Feb 17| 2021,5
During our stay the first night was very cold and uncomfortable and the tv was broke they came to fix that,Feb 17| 2021,2
Very food...............................................,Feb 16| 2021,5
There was a vacuum cleaner in front of our door. There were no dace towels. A rose pedal was in the bed which indicated to us the sheets were not clean. The phone randomly rang at different times of the night with no one on the other line. Check in is at 4 and check out eleven... that’s two hours less than other properties... ripOff. The room was nice but overall the hotel looked run down and stale. Hilton needs to update this lobby. We spent good money to stay and didn’t get the same level of service as we would elsewhere,Feb 16| 2021,2
Love the bidet wasn’t expecting that especially for a regular room and that the room was very spacious and view was really nice.,Feb 16| 2021,4
Beautiful rooms beautiful city view of the Chrysler building and Empire State Building from the 32 floor.,Feb 16| 2021,5
Best hotel in the city i will recommend this hotel,Feb 16| 2021,5
My room I select they did not give me that room upon arrival the room was small and security came up to my room for no reason and I still didn’t receive my deposit back,Feb 16| 2021,1
Amazing time !! Beautiful view| clean| and geeat staff. Will be back !,Feb 16| 2021,5
No parking. Room wasn't as clean as expected| fingerprints all over windows. Carpets in hallway and room were stained. Stunk like marijuana,Feb 16| 2021,3
Always Great Stay. Wish Convid didn’t eliminate the amenities..,Feb 16| 2021,5
It’s filthy| and My room wasn’t cleaned properly at all. I wouldn’t recommend this hotel especially during covid. It’s unsafe for things to not be cleaned properly. I called house keeping 3 times and got to the same person and no one came. I spoke to two mangers and they did absolutely NOTHING for me.,Feb 16| 2021,1
Beautiful! Very clean| great staff. Very nice rooms!,Feb 16| 2021,5
Everything was perfect except that when I came in there was a little dirt on the ceiling but I cleaned it | but honestly it was beautiful and a great view as well | an amazing hotel honestly !!,Feb 15| 2021,4
No food no water basically nothing to eat or drink!,Feb 15| 2021,5
The stay was amazing probably the best hotel I’ve been too in the city. The room is so huge and spacious. The bathroom is perfect it has a separation area for the toilet it’s self. The lighting is amazing as well. I will be back for sure,Feb 15| 2021,5
Location was great but the parking was awful. No microwave nor vending machines.  Other dan that it was fine,Feb 15| 2021,5
The fact that this place is expensive which is fine...yet no parking available you have spend yet another 320 for garage parking....not happy about that,Feb 15| 2021,3
Had a pleasant stay. Enjoyed every bit of my stay in this lovely place.,Feb 15| 2021,5
You basically get what you pay for. Room was clean but not spotless| nice view| bed was super uncomfortable and pillows were sooo squishy they were practically flat| you could smell everyone’s food through the whole floor and you can hear everyone’s conversation through the walls| the girl next door was screaming at her boyfriend and woke us up in the morning.,Feb 15| 2021,3
The hotel was pretty gross which made the place less inviting. The lobby smelled like cigarettes and the carpets throughout the hotel were stained and disgusting. Our room was better but still wasn't very clean. Our sheets had stains and I doubt they'd been washed in a while. A part of the wall near the entry way was falling apart and there were chunks of the wall on the floor. The bathtub also wasn't in the best condition as the drain wouldn't plug properly. Overall I'm pretty surprised that the place had 4 stars. I'd rate it at 2.5 or 3 stars at most. But it was a little cheaper which makes sense after staying there.,Feb 15| 2021,3
The view was nice . The room was dirty you could smell smoke in the room. And hallways,Feb 15| 2021,2
Customer service was very rude| this property doesn’t have no ice machine vending machine so you have to walk and get something to eat or drink while you’re out no on site parking| have to drive around for parking and it isn’t cheap,Feb 14| 2021,3
the view is very nice great location beautiful hotel,Feb 13| 2021,5
This hotel was in a beautiful location overlooking the city.,Feb 13| 2021,5
The most outstanding thing about this hotel is its location; near the East River for great sunrises.  It was a quiet neighborhood| vehicle and pedestrican traffic way down because of the COVID| and the UN being closed. The down side is that customer service needs to seriously up their game!  The front desk staff was largely indifferent| in my experience| except for the Manager on the morning of February 4th who immediately accommodated a request.  The rooms seemed oddly void of real furniture| and there was no real explanation as to why there is no bureau in the rooms in which to store clothing| other than the closet with  no shelves.,Feb 12| 2021,3
Good service| excellent location,Feb 12| 2021,4
Everything was nice! We definitely recommend it a 100 percent.,Feb 12| 2021,5
Beautiful hotel as advertised clean surrounding I would definitely stay there again,Feb 12| 2021,5
Convenience to restaurants and quiet area.Did not like all services closed| but that was due to COVID 19,Feb 11| 2021,4
We didn't feel safe in the hotel| possibly that hotel rents rooms paid for by NY government programs. The room we got had different windows| 3/4 of the wall height instead of a whole wall. The hotel manager on duty refused to give us the room which we booked.,Feb 10| 2021,1
I was really disappointed with how the place  looks. It looks abandoned and dusty. My stay was really uncomfortable. Heater wasn’t working properly and my bath tub was backed up with old mold debris. Staff members were friendly and attentive. The pandemic is really killing the hospitality industry.,Feb 10| 2021,2
I liked the view... I didn’t like how I had dead roaches all over my room and they transferred me to a smaller room after that.,Feb 9| 2021,2
Streaming from tv for Netflix and Youtube| with your own log in info that was a cool feature,Feb 9| 2021,3
The corner king size room was beautiful| clean and it had an amazing view. The reception was not friendly at all. She did not welcome us| barely made eye contact and seem upset. The customer service should have been better.,Feb 8| 2021,4
Okay Nothing Special,Feb 7| 2021,4
Beautiful hotel| good service| but very expensive parking garages nearby. Most street parking in the surrounding blocks was reserved for diplomats since the hotel is by the United Nations building.,Feb 6| 2021,4
Should open up café surveys Should let the freezer/fridge raider run Should have ice for guest,Feb 5| 2021,5
Had such a wonderful weekend getaway here with my boyfriend. The hotel was very clean and the staff were so friendly and accommodating. I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family!,Feb 5| 2021,5
The front desk lady was terrible. it was one day stay after my night shift duty during snow storm. It was so noisy. requested to change the room. very rude and unwilling to provide different room. ended up staying only for couple hours and paid for whole day. What a terrible service.,Feb 4| 2021,1
It was amazing. Even though I had an issue in my room half way through my stay they upgraded me right away.,Feb 4| 2021,5
The staff were very pleasant.  The view was manificent| however| the carpet had stains| everything was closed| knowing we are still in a pandemic it would have been helpful to have a microwave| it felt like someone was watching us| and there was a cracking noise from morning to dawn throughtout our stay in our room. The noise was so bad which in turn caused us not being able to sleep.  My husband and I had migraine headaches for the entire stayed.  We would never recommended & go back.   We will give it three stars because of the view and the staff.,Feb 4| 2021,2
I really like this hotel and I would stay here again| just be mindful that there are no microwaves in the rooms or on the premises at all| the restaurant and certain services will be suspended due to Covid right now| and if you plan on having visitors| during late hours there will be security in the front checking for room keys.,Feb 2| 2021,4
I would to come back bed room was very nice 👍 Yes,Feb 2| 2021,5
Carpet was very dirty| and they didn’t even have water to give at the front desk.. overall I was dissapointed. Hotel looked better in picture,Feb 1| 2021,3
Everything was perfect no complaints was made to report,Feb 1| 2021,5
There’s no parking. So if you’re gonna chance it and park across the street| just know it’s a $95 ticket.,Feb 1| 2021,4
Room was scrupulously clean. There was a lot of noise from some rooms. The doors really don’t insulate the sound very well.  It’s a bit unsettling to walk down a hallway and hear so much of people’s lives.  Party walls were good| though.,Feb 1| 2021,4
Room had a smell of smoke| few stains on carpet. Fridge wasn’t working light flicking in fridge.,Feb 1| 2021,3
First the front desk clerk came off very rude and when I was asking questions about my room she was very short and cute me off.   The hotel was nice the rooms could have been more cleaner like wiped down on the furniture old food stains were on the table and night stand windows needed a little glass cleaner other than thats the view was beautiful.,Jan 31| 2021,4
This hotel was amazing in every way. My boyfriend and I were very satisfied with the room and staff. Very nice| will definitely be back again!,Jan 31| 2021,5
My wife and I had a lovely time for our wedding anniversary.,Jan 27| 2021,5
Convenient and good location. Good staff and clean rooms,Jan 27| 2021,5
I think there should be better parking options for guest.,Jan 26| 2021,3
Extremely dirty hotel.,Jan 25| 2021,2
Excellent view of the empire state building . Beautifully decored room amazing restaurant Patsy,Jan 25| 2021,5
No free wifi| the sheets were stained and the door of the bathroom had literal hand prints on them.,Jan 25| 2021,1
I liked the hotel itself| the staff and the location. I did not like the mass amount of disturbances in our floor. People going in and out. I tried to call the front desk but didn't get anyone. Also - the bathroom not having a fan is a HUGE mistake. Not to mention the shower head didn't work properly| we had to use the side extension which was very hard. The $15 per day internet charge is also a scam. I loved Hilton but this made me change my mind on that. Too much money over all for a fairly poor quality hotel.,Jan 25| 2021,2
Everything was good| but the front desk attendant at the check out time was very rude and with bad attitude. The stay was good| place is clean and comfortable| the location is very convenient| definitely the lobby area needs an update.,Jan 24| 2021,4
Room was not cleaned| had leftovers in fridge. stains on the floor| water was cold| and air vents act as listening device(Ultimate Violation Of Privacy...could not sleep. Upon checkin| was not greeted| but told my bag needs to be sniffed...,Jan 23| 2021,2
The view and the overall style of the room was great and felt like I was at my own house| the bed was great,Jan 22| 2021,5
Beautiful view from hotel room! Friendly and accommodating staff. Wonderful stay,Jan 21| 2021,5
It looks good on Expedia but the carpet was sooooooooo dirty !!!! The room didn’t look like what i thought it was going to look like. 1 of our pilllws had dirt on it . The room was decent size but the walls were so thin | i literally heard the person next door talking through the walls,Jan 18| 2021,3
It was great. The view was phenomenal and the room was so comfortable. The only downside was the parking. There was a lot of parking lots but expensive. Other than that I enjoyed the trip.,Jan 18| 2021,5
The stay was ok..when we got there the bathroom was still dirty hair in the shower and on the floor. There wasn’t a microwave for us to heat up our food. Lastly there wasn't any vending machine for drinks or snacks which means we had to leave the hotel to get something.pretty inconvenient.,Jan 18| 2021,3
Front desk was a bit rude when I called 2x before our stay| other than that everything was perfectly fine.,Jan 18| 2021,5
Very nice hotel but the walls are not sound proof so you’ll hear everyone. Especially if your in the hallway. Staff was great. Amenities were closed because of covid,Jan 17| 2021,4
The cleanliness of the room was extremely disappointing. Hair on the floor near the shower and the glasses they provide for drinks were dirty| obviously used by the last people in the room. Towels were very rough and the bed was uncomfortable. Stains on the carpet and the windows were very dirty on the inside(fingerprints and greasy smudges).The front desk staff were bare minimum helpful and didn’t ask or seem to care if the stay was satisfactory. Location was very convenient to the consulate but otherwise very disappointing.,Jan 15| 2021,3
Amazing view,Jan 15| 2021,5
I loved everything about this experience | but finding parking here at 10pm is very difficult.,Jan 15| 2021,5
Beautiful hotel especially with city view would recommend to everyone,Jan 15| 2021,5
Beautiful room views of east side Hudson River| I believe the quien about bridge and skyline. Excellent location and safe neighborhood. Room in very good condition and comfortable. Very professional check in service. Overall a very nice stay although short.,Jan 14| 2021,4
My stay was good| a reasonable location| not so close to the metro but a short distance depending on the line you would use| very good view from the room.,Jan 14| 2021,4
The check in receptionist was very friendly and the room was clean with an amazing view.,Jan 12| 2021,5
The stay here was lovely. I loved our room with city view. Close to everything,Jan 11| 2021,5
I don’t like nothing about this hotel. From the staff to the service’s nothing was likable,Jan 10| 2021,1
The view and the renovated bathrooms was amazing.,Jan 9| 2021,5
Big rooms| amazing views| clean hotel| friendly staff. It’s also close to restaurants. I’m definitely staying here again.,Jan 8| 2021,4
Nice hotel inside and out but towels weren’t enough in room usually they give you extra .,Jan 7| 2021,5
It was an amazing hotel. Super clean and close to a lot of places we wanted to visit. Customer service is the best there. Everyone is friendly.,Jan 2| 2021,5
Amazing,Dec 28| 2020,5
excellent| room was very clean and modern with a very nice view| would definitely recommend,Dec 25| 2020,5
The room was clean| the location was convenient| and the view was amazing from my corner king room.,Dec 22| 2020,5
It was amazing. My husband and I stayed in the corner King room.,Dec 22| 2020,5
Great Love it thanks,Dec 21| 2020,5
I live in the city and wanted to plan a small weekend getaway with my boyfriend. We had a king room and it looked exactly like the pictures. Due to COVID| the gym and restaurants including room service are unavailable| but you can order delivery to the hotel from Uber eats and more. Service was friendly and efficient. The carpet in the hallway was very dirty| like bleach was spilled and left a long trail throughout the hall. Other than that| the hotel is clean.,Dec 20| 2020,4
I like the room| it just wasn’t cleaned well enough. you could see traces of the people who used it last. there were food crumbs in places and even confetti in the bathroom.,Dec 18| 2020,3
I am satisfied cleanness and view. I have a little bit disappointed the air conditioner (heating) could set less than 26C so I felt a little cold in the room.,Dec 17| 2020,4
Loved this place beautiful stay beautiful room parking sucked but amazing !!!! Man at the front desk from mass is amazing!!  Stay here !!!!,Dec 14| 2020,5
Wonderful hotel and wonderful view. I honestly loves staying at this hotel 💜,Dec 14| 2020,5
I loved the view and how spacious the room was! I enjoyed my time,Dec 12| 2020,5
This hotel is great. I got a corner room so the views were incredible. The staff up front was so great and helpful. The hotel itself is in a great place because its about a 5 minute walk to grand central station with access to all subways. There are also lots of places to eat within walking distance and coffee shops. I was there during COVID so not sure how their amenities are| considering they were all closed but such a great stay!,Dec 12| 2020,5
I had a wonderful staying at the hotel| I will stay anytime... thank you so much,Dec 10| 2020,5
Cleanliness is very good but lack of food| atleast drinking water| tried to call front desk so many times but did not answer.,Dec 7| 2020,4
Great size room and bathroomExcellent place to entertain and great view of city,Dec 7| 2020,5
There was no ice machine| the mirrorIn our room was broken .. Lights was horrible,Dec 6| 2020,2
Lovely location. The hotel rooms are rundown. The lobby is lovely. For the price| just wasn’t worth it.,Dec 4| 2020,3
Really nice hotel | I enjoyed it very much | would recommend| and only 30 min walk to Korean town !,Dec 3| 2020,5
Wonderful quiet hotel with incredible views! I love staying here,Dec 3| 2020,5
WORST HOTEL SERVICE BOOKED A ROOM CONFIRMED AND WHEN INGET THEIR THEY STATE IS WAS CANCELLED NOT BY ME HAD THE CONFIRMATION AND VALID EMAIL PRESENT AND NO HELP WAS PROVIDED,Dec 2| 2020,1
Thankful for putting us in a room with an amazing view.,Dec 1| 2020,5
i was looking forward to great view from my bed| however in my room (triangle shape) I had to walk to window to catch the skyline view.  No service although bottled water was listed in hotel.com so had to go out daily to get water.  Also had to take garbage out daily.  Wish hotel had specified means for garbage pickup.  I am familiar with area so easily navigated surroundings.,Dec 1| 2020,3
Just OK in my opinion| the location is great but the rooms were dated and some lights didn’t work. It also took a very long time to check in.,Nov 30| 2020,3
I don’t like they don’t have parting .................,Nov 30| 2020,5
Hotel description doesn’t do justice. Room was amazing. Huge bathroom. Amazing view of the city. Smart TV was a huge plus. Bed and pillows were super comfortable. Great location| not in the middle of all the craziness but still super close. Definitely booking here again,Nov 30| 2020,5
Beautiful rooms. Hotel needs vending machines also ice maker.,Nov 29| 2020,4
The room had not been cleaned. There was a full can of beer in the mini fridge| empty used plastic cups under the bed and heart shaped confetti all over the the cracks and corners of the room plus the tv remote was sticky. It’s easy to tell that the room did not get cleaned. After 3 failed attempts to call down stairs and let them know how dirty the room was I had to go down stairs where I was told there was no other room available. I wasn’t alone| I had my two daughters and my wife with me| during this pandemic and we couldn’t get a cleaned room even if we wanted to.,Nov 28| 2020,1
I wasn't too impressed with the lobby and checking in.My bed was slanted as so was the wall.Housekeeping was very good.Personall at front desk was not impressive either.,Nov 27| 2020,3
I loved the experience I had at this hotel. Everyone was super friendly and helpful. It was close to everything and most of the time there was a cab outside for convenience.,Nov 27| 2020,5
The room was very clean. Very comfortable. The lighting in the room was adequate.  Great view from the 34th floor. Great place for a great price.,Nov 26| 2020,5
The thing that was very unique about the hotel was the city view.,Nov 24| 2020,5
Extreme levels of noise in room across hallway until very late (past 2am) with loud music and many visitors. Made multiple calls to security on two nights of stay| but they kept letting the guests off with more and more warnings.,Nov 24| 2020,2
Really liked! Clean| comfortable hotel. Will stay there next time too,Nov 24| 2020,5
Thank you!,Nov 23| 2020,5
Thank you for your excellent service as always.,Nov 23| 2020,5
It was great,Nov 17| 2020,5
Surprised my boyfriend with a weekend here. It was lovely. Just the fancy toilet controller wasn’t working :(,Nov 16| 2020,4
We got the stay for a weekend surprise getaway. We checked in pretty late in the evening. When we looked at the room the next morning we realized that the room hadn’t been cleaned and the sheets and towels hadn’t been changed either. We actually slept in the bed that was unchanged during COVID-19. The tables were filthy and dust was everywhere. When we complained they offered to change our room but then we would loose the view that we wanted. Instead they opted to bring us Lysol wipes and a terry cloth to clean the room ourselves. Also the fridge didn’t work well and there was no microwave. In the end they didn’t even offer a discount for the poor stay and condition even after the manager came up and saw how bad the room was herself. I’m very displeased about the entire weekend there and I do not recommend it for a stay.,Nov 13| 2020,1
I will definitely be staying here again. The views and customer service are unmatched.,Nov 9| 2020,5
The room was very spacious. I had an amazing view of downtown Manhattan as well as the East river. The elevator is very fast| your ears will pop. Check-in and check-out was quick and easy. I recommend this place!,Nov 8| 2020,5
Good room| but called home keeping plus front desk for some fresh sheets about three times and no one ever showed up or called to tell me what was going on. After some time I just got tired of complaining| only a two night stay.,Nov 6| 2020,2
Great welcome. Very accomadating. Courteous staff. Great price!!!,Nov 6| 2020,5
amazing will be back it was nice well kept room was on 32nd floor :) ears was popping GOOD problems love it,Nov 4| 2020,5
No room service due to COVID shower wouldn’t drain | okay experience nice location,Nov 3| 2020,4
The staff at the hotel were pleasant and helpful. The hotel itself was very outdated and frankly I expected more from a Hilton hotel. The room was comfortable and the bathroom was updated. Overall it was comfortable for what we needed but I wouldn’t go out of my way to stay there again when in NYC.,Nov 2| 2020,3
This hotel was a little uncomfortable with guard dogs waking around. I paid extra for a city view and the window was less than a 3rd of the wall space that it was on. I also found old rose pedals and a rag behind one of the benches.,Nov 2| 2020,3
Room is nice. Bathroom is the best part. But the hotel is a bit run down and unloved and the staff are below par. Requests for anything had to be made multiple times.,Nov 1| 2020,3
Great stay| friendly staff| great view .. checkout took a longer time,Nov 1| 2020,5
No water or ice machines throughout entire facility,Oct 31| 2020,1
The hotel stay was very pleasant and comfortable. The staff was very polite and helpful| the location was very convenient,Oct 31| 2020,5
Large rooms!!! Nice views!!! Was here during COVID-19 and they were very clean!,Oct 30| 2020,5
I was so nice !! I love the room | the service | everything .,Oct 30| 2020,5
Despite the view| the room didn’t seem cleaned nor sanitized. There were fingerprints all over the walls and windows| the carpet felt dirty| there was Urine on the toilet seat| the bed was uncomfortable| and the towels didn’t smell clean.,Oct 28| 2020,3
The room was great. However| I do not recommend it for people who wakes up early. For two consecutive nights| there was a loud noise in the next room till 4am. I was really upset.,Oct 27| 2020,2
Where do I begin??? Upon arriving there is a guy with a dog who randomly walks up to sniff your bags before entering the hotel without an explanation. When I asked why is there a dog sniffing my bag| he points to a sign. Since we were so close to the United Nations it is a security precaution. Then once I get checked into my room| I pull back the covers as I normally do at any hotel| there were hairs and stains in the sheets| there was also a chase in the room that was completely filthy. I sat on the chase and so much dirt and dust came from it| I was in disbelief| there was even an AirPod case that popped out of the chase along with the dirt. The carpet was filthy with debris and stains and had not been cleaned or at least vacuumed. I called the front desk and the manager changed my room and the second room was not much better. It was a little more clean than the first one. There was a hole in the ceiling and stains all over the place. I couldn’t help but to think about how this place has not been sanitized with covid 19 going around and it made me very weary. Also the noise in this place from other guest was unbelievable. It seemed as if my entire floor was having a dance party and the entire floor reeked of marijuana. I would not recommend this place to anyone looking to relax on vacation. This hotel gets a 1 star rating from me. I will also post a review on all social media and other outlets. I also have pictures of how disgusting this place was.,Oct 27| 2020,1
Very clean and amazing view of the city. Close to many restaurants so amazing location. If you drive there however| the hotel does not have a garage so parking your car for your stay may be a concern. I found a paying garage near it however that was about a good 3 minute walk so there is a solution. Just would have been amazing if the hotel itself provided a parking area for its guests. Otherwise great experience. Would recommend and come back,Oct 26| 2020,5
So my room was on the 32nd floor... I get up there and my key didn't work. So I had to go back down to get a new one. Go allllll the way back up and that key didn't work. So security had to come change the battery on the door. I finally get into the room and it's nothing like the room advertised| it smelled like old cigarettes and they had no wash clothes in the room. Definitely won't stay there again.,Oct 26| 2020,1
Awesome hotel| nice view of city. I pretty sure recommend to my friends.,Oct 26| 2020,4
I loved the view and the room looked exactly like the pictures.,Oct 26| 2020,5
Nothing was unique about the building.Not the stag,Oct 26| 2020,1
The room look like it wasn’t clean. Specifically the bathroom.,Oct 25| 2020,1
The view was amazing and the room was lovely as well.,Oct 25| 2020,5
Room was not clean. Hotel seemed well past its prime. Carpets were stained and dirty.,Oct 24| 2020,2
There was a used condom under the bed :( We did not report this to the staff because we didn’t find it until the morning of our check out when we lifted up the bed skirt to make sure we didn’t leave any socks etc behind. Clearly it did not affect our stay since we didn’t know it was there| but it’s just gross knowing that it was there the whole time we were :( Since it’s Covid right now| you’d think they deep cleaned the rooms but unfortunately they missed a bit.,Oct 24| 2020,3
City view was excellent 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍,Oct 23| 2020,5
It was ok.... the pictures aren’t the same as the room. I picked the hotel because of the large windows. I wanted to wake up to a beautiful view in the morning. Room was a good size & the bed was comfortable. The bathroom had a weird smell to it. Definitely would recommend on bringing ur own cleaning products. Staff was not pleasant.,Oct 21| 2020,3
Was very disappointed in the check in process waited online for 45 minutes just to check in that wasn’t a good start. But the hotel was nice I love the Cityview.,Oct 19| 2020,3
The hotel staff were not welcoming and were at times rude. The room was nice however there was always a queue to use the elevators. People were not always wearing masks and there was no one from the hotel staff that was actually ensuring that. We were even charged for wifi despite it being included in our itinerary,Oct 19| 2020,3
I selected a corner room and was worth the price.  The room very clean.,Oct 19| 2020,5
Dirty carpets throughout| dirty bed skirt| difficult to upgrade and etc......not a good experience. Will not stay here again.,Oct 19| 2020,2
Stayed during COVID-19 for my son who suffered a health emergency. The hotel staff was caring| kind| and thoughtful. In spite of the rest of America not showing a bit of compassion during the pandemic| the limited staff of the Hilton Millennial went the extra step to insure my son (and me) we were comfortable and taken care of during and after my son’s surgery at Memorial Sloan Kettering. I am forever grateful...,Oct 19| 2020,5
Very nice and pleasant and for sure will book again in the near future,Oct 18| 2020,4
Had a great time visiting home hated the gym was close but understandable overall no issues,Oct 18| 2020,4
Excellent house staff!!! From the front desk| to housekeeping| to management— they were all incredibly patient and accommodating to my requests. The view from my room was extraordinary and I would definitely stay there again!,Oct 18| 2020,5
Omg i loved the City view the staff the hotel very clean the rooms nice,Oct 18| 2020,5
The view was great. No ice machine though. The hotel was clean.,Oct 17| 2020,5
The rooms were very nicely set up| the lobby is beautiful| the hotel in itself is peaceful . I had a great stay ! Housekeeping was accommodating| desk staff amazing . No complaints | definitely will be a frequent customer.,Oct 17| 2020,5
The property is located close to major amenities and a safe neighbourhood.,Oct 16| 2020,5
It was great. The room is really clean. I feel comfortable staying here for a night. And the room has good view as I can see Brooklyn Bridge from my hotel room. It was $92/night for a 2 person room. We had a queen size bed.,Oct 15| 2020,4
Very nice. Beautiful room and view. Definitely would recommend to a friend or come back.,Oct 14| 2020,5
liked the staffdidn't find a vending machinexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,Oct 14| 2020,4
The phots,Oct 13| 2020,1
Great room. Clean and spacious just how I like it!,Oct 13| 2020,5
Location was great. Views were nice. The price was also good. Rooms were clean. My only dislike was the carpets in the hallways were orange and dirty. The colors of the hallways were gray also making it kind of dark but my biggest dislike would be the dirty hallway carpets. However| rooms were nice and clean.,Oct 12| 2020,4
Great stay| friendly front desk!  i will definitely stay again,Oct 12| 2020,5
It’s a five star and the management decided to keep it open. This been| there shud be adequate service available to guests. This Used to be high class location is now maintaining low budget motel standards! Expect more!!!!,Oct 12| 2020,4
The hotel is clean| safe| and almost close to tourist attractions. Times Square is like 20 min walking and the rest of the sites| I took an Uber. There is a good pizza spot and breakfast cafe close by. Due to Covid| they are not cleaning the room daily but you can ask for extra towels| etc.,Oct 12| 2020,5
Worst Experience Ever. Terrible. we booked a room for 3 people and they gave us a room for 2 people and they said Expedia put the wrong info at their end| Ver un,Oct 12| 2020,1
Found a vibrator under the sofa after we misplaced a wallet and went looking for it. There was no full sized towels| so we had to call for some. Despite 2 beds| there was only bedding for one abs despite calling| they did not pick up to provide bedding.,Oct 12| 2020,3
The room was lovely although it was a bit different than what the site showed. However| we both enjoyed the views from the corner view room. We will definitely stay there again but for a longer stay.,Oct 11| 2020,4
Very nice| clean and comfortable. The check in process was easy,Oct 11| 2020,4
Nice place and location. Clean. No glasses or ice bucket. As a HH member - given WiFi and late checkout.,Oct 10| 2020,5
Great location in the sense that it’s right next to the UN! The hotel offers great views of the river! Luxurious room amenities!,Oct 10| 2020,5
The quiet sunny  UN side of Midtown - staff is very upbeat and eager to serve and overcome the understandable limitations created by the pandemic. Thank you Hilton!,Oct 10| 2020,4
Unfortunately i had so-so experience. I booked city view room. Goods: view was alright and the room was spacious enough. Bad: cleaninness of the room (bad smell of vomit near the bed)| shower need maintenance| staff unfriednly and not helpful| all sanitizer boxes were empty| storage wasn't working and no one notified me so i had to care my luggage all day. Front desk did not care. As a customer do not recommend,Oct 9| 2020,2
Amazing service clean room amazing view great sleep,Oct 9| 2020,5
Picture was not the room we got. Room service took forever to switch remote out because what was originally in the room was not working.,Oct 9| 2020,3
Probably one of the worst hotel I’ve ever been|The staff was very friendly but all the rest was disappointing,Oct 8| 2020,2
The hotel did not advise me that there would be construction work going on right next to my window in the next building starting at 7:30 AMThe bed was atrocious and very uncomfortable along with the pillows that were like bricksThe room itself was very cold and not inviting there was not a single picture on the wall to cheer things up the room was very cold in clinical and there was mold in the bathroom showerI called to complain about the noise going on in the hotel and I receive no call backAll in all a disappointing visit at a Hilton hotel,Oct 8| 2020,2
Check in was easy.Great location.Very accomodating under Corona pandemic. Extra towels and amenities offered and dropped off in room while I was out. Indoor gift shop closed but a few placed were open on 2nd Avenue to get water| snacks etc. Was a great 3 days.,Oct 7| 2020,5
Very clean and helpful staff. Also beautiful view from our room. The lobby receptionist had good input on what to do or where to go,Oct 5| 2020,5
It was very little services offered and most of property was closed so I couldn’t give a true rating.,Oct 5| 2020,4
The check in was pretty frustrating because the customer was holding everybody up and the guy said the other person was on break and then the next morning while I was trying to start my day while I was showering I had soap all over my body and then the water pressure started going down and then turned coffee brown so they had to fix that then later on in the day when I came back from my outing while still had soap on my skin|something was wrong with the elevators. It was bad enough to the point where fire fighters had to come and fix it. I really don’t know how I feel about this hotel I mean they were pretty nice I will say but the overall experience was bad maybe it was a bad weekend I don’t know,Oct 5| 2020,2
I had an amazing experience. I highly recommend it,Oct 5| 2020,5
Great looking hotel but definitely need better attention and service especially with Covid room wise since got there my room wasn’t clean  towels had stain i request new one didn’t got them till i when again downstairs n ask no clean service provide next day bed shot dirty definitely suprice because great hotel,Oct 5| 2020,2
Check in was extremely slow. When I got there there was only one person at the desk. There was no line| just myself and my partner. She went into the back and we can just hear the chatter and laughing while we were waiting to be checked in.We finally got a room| headed up just to see that we were given a room that had not been cleaned. There was alcohol everywhere| sheets were a mess and gross| towels all over the floor.We headed back down to the desk and there was now a line. We waited a total of 45 minutes to receive a new room. The person at the desk was not pleasant nor welcoming.,Oct 5| 2020,2
I loved the location and view was spectacular. The check in process was smooth and professional so that was great. I get to the room and the bathroom was not CLEANED! there was a ring around the tub| hair on the floor and dark spots that looked like throw up by the toilet (so gross). After calling down to housekeeping a maid came and cleaned the room while we were in the room (very upset about that). I go downstairs to inform the front desk about the room and the young lady tries to dismiss me by telling me its a housekeeping problem. I was so upset that her coworker had to take over the conversation and give me the business card of the manager to call.,Oct 5| 2020,3
The hotel was nice the gemtelman that check me in on saturday wasn't pleasant never told  me it was 100 accidental policy which is ok  he was like a robot not pleasant at all. Overal the stay was nice,Oct 4| 2020,4
Love the room i had And would definitely stay here again !!,Oct 4| 2020,5
I wish I was told that if I didn’t pay ahead of time I was required to pay the hotel a refundable 50$ deposit. But aside from that this hotel is the nicest and friendliest hotel I’ve ever been to .,Oct 4| 2020,4
Staff were great! Room was nice and clean. Would definitely go back!,Oct 1| 2020,5
Perfect location. Staff was very pleasant and accomodating,Sep 30| 2020,5
The hotel was clean and very comfortable but the internet was not working for most of my stay but everything else was exceptional.,Sep 28| 2020,5
I was rather disappointed to find out the hotel doesn't have an ice machine;  I also tried calling the front desk about 7 times to find out if there was a bending machine & no answer.,Sep 28| 2020,3
No parking. customer Service sucks. Would never stay here again,Sep 28| 2020,1
Got to the room and it’s was Very dirty and didnot clean plus the staff at the hotel was nasty and was not Sympathetic I would never stay there again,Sep 28| 2020,1
Overall it was alright. Room seemed a lot dusty for some reason.,Sep 28| 2020,3
I didn't like that the hotel says that they have hotel parking and didn't. The hotel is outdated| there were no simple amenities for an example an ice machine. And there was a huge insect in our room.,Sep 26| 2020,2
This hotel was on of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at. The carpet it the room was partially ripped up| they advertised valet and there was none| no bellhop or even a cart to use to bring your bags to your room. There were huge roaches in the room and no bottled water. I’ve never been to a hotel that didn’t offer bottled water to guests in the rooms. If you try to call the front desk or for room service no one picks up at all. When I was leaving to check out absolutely no one was at the front desk and people were just standing around waiting. I will never stay here again,Sep 25| 2020,2
I loved this hotel. Parking was a bit of a hassle but after we got it sorted out everything was fine. The room was beautiful and clean.,Sep 25| 2020,5
Everything was perfect except there was a door missing in the bathroom so we couldn’t slide it so that it can close.,Sep 25| 2020,4
No parking at the time I went we just had to go up the street and pay for parking,Sep 24| 2020,5
Hotel looked better than in the pictures! Nice and quiet| Great view. Definatly will book again😍,Sep 22| 2020,5
Staff was not helpful|I was celebrating my anniversary with my wife..did not make my stay special|even though I mentioned it was my anniversary. The cards to the elevator was not working|my wife had to ask 2 people to help her out. As well there was very loud music and nobody came up to say anything to the guest.,Sep 22| 2020,1
Good experience overall. Everything was perfect and on time,Sep 21| 2020,5
We loved the view and the distance to everything in the hotel. However| it did not seem like they cleaned before we came in besides the bed and the bathroom because the coffee maker was dusty and had old coffee in it and also the mini fridge was not working,Sep 21| 2020,4
Very clean| neat and comfy. Only downside was when we requested a remote for the tv in our room and ignored us twice. Didn’t ruin the stay just annoying.,Sep 21| 2020,4
The view was the best part of the room. The room was super clean which is always good and they had pay movies which I enjoyed very much. One of the room lamps was going on and off and there wasn’t enough towels in the bathroom but| other than that| our stay was amazing.,Sep 21| 2020,5
Overall great! Clean hotel| great location| close to the Grand Central Station| or just a 20-minute walking distance to Times Square. Amazing view!!!! I just wish the receptionists were friendlier and explained all the services| amenities| check out times| etc. They spoke about 2-3 words to us at check-in and check-out.,Sep 21| 2020,4
I liked the view from my room and it seemed like there was security in front of the hotel every night so it felt safe. The only thing i disliked is I didnt get the room that was in the picture with the full window.,Sep 21| 2020,4
No.place to park and it cost almost half of the cost to to stay just to park my car for 24 hrs.  Get a garage,Sep 20| 2020,4
Good place,Sep 20| 2020,5
Very nice hotel highly recommended!! :) and love the location,Sep 20| 2020,5
Hotel was amazing. The room was perfect and the view was everything.,Sep 19| 2020,5
No ice no food  no coffee no nothing just a room,Sep 17| 2020,4
This is an awesome hotel with amazing views! Excellent location with easy access to to public transit and lots of great places to eat and drink within easy walking distance. The staff were very polite| accommodating and helpful. Always quick to answer any questions I had. The room was clean and comfortable with plenty of space and nice amenities. I will definitely look at staying here again in the future!,Sep 16| 2020,5
It has one of the best views of the city! There isn’t much to do in the hotel it self,Sep 16| 2020,4
Stayed two nights and will never come back Although the staff at front desk was friendly| it seemed he was the only guy working in the hotel. The skewed headboard and the dusk layers on the table showed the room had not been cleaned recently. There was no hair dryer in the bathroom and I called three times to both “concierge” and “guest room service” line in the morning and waited for another hour for the hair dryer delivery. In the evening I called multiple times to ask about ice and no answer at all. During the pandemic the everything runs slowly but it’s not an excuse of plunged service to have only couple of staff on duty for two giant hotel buildings.,Sep 12| 2020,2
Pros:Very spacious room.Amazing view of the city and Empire State Building (where we were located if you look to the extreme left you can see downtown Manhattan and World Trade Center. Curtains open/close by pushing buttons on the wall. An awesome feature! Huge bathroom! Toilet with a bidet in it; a remote with all the options on how to get cleaned is on the wall (I had the accessible room so I am not sure if this feature is in all the rooms).Toilet seat actually warms you. Very comfy bed. Sitting areas with a table so you can properly dine. Very comfy chairs.Cool staff (just wished we were able to be moved to a different room. See Cons)Cons:-The accessible rooms have a tub| which is why I requested one because I have a bad back and hip. I thought the tub was deep when looking at the pictures on the website but found out that the tub sits high up and isn't deep at all| making it limited to shower or take a bath. To make it worse| the tub is VERY slippery. Myself and fiance both slipped the first day| which wasn't cool. I did inform the staff 3 times about changing my room for a regular king bed room. Front desk sent someone with a tub mat (which let me know this is something that is complained about quite frequently) and it was sort of helpful| but didn't help with how awkward the whole thing was. HUGE negative for me. Carpets were very dirty; they were not steamed for a while| which you can tell| and weren't vacuumed. (can't put anymore due to character limit),Sep 9| 2020,3
This hotel was great. It was clean| the views are amazing and the service was very good,Sep 8| 2020,5
great space| atmosphere| rooms clean and the views are stunning,Sep 8| 2020,5
Lovely location spotless clean very safe and comfy,Sep 8| 2020,5
We paid alot for this hotel and was unhappy with my stay. 1. Requested room service to clean our rooms. Didn’t happen. 2. They couldn’t hold our bags until we left for   Airport later in the day,Sep 7| 2020,3
The room smelled like cigarettes. Had pissed on the floor. And the rugs were stained with stuff that look like it was freshly spilled overall very unhappy,Sep 7| 2020,1
Only comment is that it would be nice if the room had a piece of furniture with drawers fit your clothes,Sep 6| 2020,4
It was disappointing that they didn’t advertise that they had no amenities.I mean| nothing. No ice| no gym| couldn’t really offer us anything.The room was nice| the bed was insanely comfortable. There was a nice River view and a lot of local spots for coffee and carry out.,Sep 6| 2020,4
Loved it | wanna go back soon,Sep 5| 2020,5
Beautiful View,Sep 3| 2020,4
My husband and I stayed at the Millennium for our Anniversary. The hotel was very clean and comfortable and had 21st centuries features. It took a couple of visits to the front desk to get information on parking and COVID restrictions. I was a nice stay and I would stay again and I would upgrade my room.....Please do not show Frederick's name. I am Nancy| his wife and I do all the reviews.,Sep 1| 2020,4
Experience is great. I purchase an extra insurance (about 10$)I don`t know if it saved me a room but it worked out pretty good.We got a room at 31st floor (3124) which is the great view on lower Manhattan and Hudson River.A room was a bit tiny but this view.Love it.,Sep 1| 2020,5
Great accommodation rooms are not the best but nothing to complain about..,Sep 1| 2020,4
The view of the city warranted this stay,Aug 27| 2020,5
The television kept on turning on by itself| the remote control wasn’t working either. Lastly| we weren’t provided enough towels,Aug 23| 2020,3
Everything was great| the location | the view from the room that we got was amazing. I loved it and I’ll definitely be going back.,Aug 23| 2020,5
Loved my room stay with the city view n doing a lil sight seeing,Aug 22| 2020,5
Horrible would never stay there again | checked out early worst experience ever,Aug 18| 2020,1
The Room smelled of cigarette smoke from the time I walked in of course I couldn’t change rooms because none was available| the cleanliness wasn’t there. The best part of the whole situation was the view.,Aug 17| 2020,3
Wonderful hotel with great views! No complaints,Aug 16| 2020,5
I’ve stood in about 10 hotels within the last 2 weeks| this hotel is by far the best hotel experience I ever had ! The views were so amazing ! & the staff is by far the nicest people !! Not one bad thing I can say about this hotel,Aug 11| 2020,5
Hotel is in excellent condition| spacious room and great staff. Covid has affected the services (no food service) but menus are available. There is no parking that was disappointing and costly. Otherwise the stay was great. We stayed on the 31st floor and the view was amazing.,Aug 10| 2020,5
I called front desk 3 times asking for someone to please go check out the Air Conditioner because it wasn’t working and no body went to fix it. We spend 2 very hot nights which was very disappointing,Aug 10| 2020,3
The room was amazing! The view was worth really wo,Aug 8| 2020,4
We did not have a fridge at a point | I also requested a king bed and I got a queen which means I paid more then what I was suppose to and didn't get the room I paid for.,Aug 5| 2020,3
The view of the room was amazing. Staff was very kind. Overall great experience,Aug 3| 2020,5
Great service super clean! Quick room service! & easy check in and check out,Aug 2| 2020,4
Very clean and a beautiful room I got there really late and they allowed me to have a late check out until 1pm for free overall experience was very nice,Jul 31| 2020,5
Loved the hotel very nice and clean| however I thought someone would clean the room when we left because that would be social distancing but no one did and there is literally nothing open not even the deli in the hotel. Other than that the hotel was nice and quiet and the view was amazing. There are no stores but around the corner is Duane Ried.,Jul 28| 2020,4
It was great. The view of the city was beautiful,Jul 25| 2020,5
One of the best hotel in the city. Our stay was phenomenal| outstanding and we can’t wait to go back. It’s super clean| very luxurious| very quiet and safe. This is our new go-to hotel.,Jul 24| 2020,5
Stayed to enjoys some views of the NYC skyline. We had a corner room and enjoyed views of the Chysler| Empire State and World Trade Center One buildings.  Billionaire row was easily in view also. We arrived to late at night to sample any on house dining or bar activities but the hotel does offer quite a few choices.,Jul 23| 2020,5
So clean and a pretty beautiful space.Exactly what it looks like in pictures| but the window is definitely misleading. The only thing I can complain about is the shower. There is only one glass panel and it doesn't slide over| so there was an issue with water flowing over. Other than that| highly recommend.,Jul 23| 2020,5
absolutely loved this place. Very spacious and clean. The view is amazing,Jul 22| 2020,5
Clean and functional| open when I needed a stay.Unfortunately there weren’t any bell hops to hold my luggage. Concierge was exeedingly accommodating.,Jul 21| 2020,5
Good area of Manhattan| clean room| bathroom is nice and spacious.,Jul 20| 2020,5
It was pretty good. I had a corner room with a beautiful view. The concierge was helpful. The hotel was beautiful. I’d go again,Jul 19| 2020,5
Very nice view| and romantic. Great deal great price,Jul 18| 2020,5
I will definitely stay again at this hotel the Room was very clean and the room look just like the picture,Jul 17| 2020,4
Service| hotel| cleanliness and location are great. Room looks beautiful with city views to the empire estate. The bed in the other hand needs upgrade. When you sit by the headboard the bed moves to the front and it’s so uncomfortable that’s the reason why I didn’t stay another day sadly.,Jul 16| 2020,5
Room was great. Great views and location. Would come back,Jul 14| 2020,5
It wasn’t welcoming at all. Lady at front desk did not care at all she seem like she ain’t want to take care of us.,Jul 12| 2020,3
Beautiful room and outstanding view of the city from our window .... Wow ! Nicole at the front desk was wonderful and got us into our room earlier then check in . I really appreciated that because my husband was having surgery at a near by hospital and I needed to charge our phones .,Jul 9| 2020,5
Very nice hotel in a quiet neighborhood location has very much improved since Hilton has taken over management,Jul 8| 2020,4
Rooms was amazing and the view was nice and also the service was great,Jun 28| 2020,5
The view is amazing from the room. The room is cozy and very clean.,Jun 23| 2020,4
The city views at this hotel were amazing!! Great service,Jun 3| 2020,5
The staff member that checked us in was dismissive and rude. This seemed like an anomaly though as the rest of the staff was kind and welcoming.,May 29| 2020,3
The front desk was the most welcoming. and friendly.,Mar 17| 2020,5
excellent !  I love this place is very very very nice,Mar 13| 2020,5
Everything was very nice. Didn't really stay in the room that long| busy shopping and seeing a Broadway show. Wish we could have spent another night!!!!,Mar 2| 2020,5

Everything was very nice. Didn't really stay in the room that long| busy shopping and seeing a Broadway show. Wish we could have spent another night!!!!,Mar 2| 2020,5
Good location near Grand Central. Room was fine| really could only find fault with the heating controls which didn’t work so was far too hot. That said| no free Wi-Fi in the bedrooms in this day and age.....,Jan 22| 2020,4
The view was amazing and the room was super clean . We enjoyed our stay there.,Jan 19| 2020,4
They need to clean better!! The bed needs to actually queen sizes.,Jan 19| 2020,2
It was a very pleasant stay for me and my girlfriend. We stay for 6 nights over New Years and had the most wonderful view of the city with buildings such as the Empire State and Chrysler in view. I do think the view was largely part of why our experience was excellent and of course| this is not always a guarantee. I would recommend emailing Hilton beforehand to request a certain view.,Jan 7| 2020,5
Location was great| staff friendly. Bar drinks expensive.,Jan 4| 2020,4
I love this hotel.. from the location| to the views| to the friendliness of the staff| to the food. Never has a single complaint and I've stayed there over several times,Jan 3| 2020,5
It was a nice hotel. It did have its downsides | coffee maker didn’t work| dirt on the comforter| dust in the mugs| tv didn’t work properly. Location wise| pretty far away from the subway around a 13 min walk which is relative to how much you want to walk. Everything is also far away 20-30 min walks unless you walk to the subway. We got the room with city view and it was gorgeous.,Jan 3| 2020,4
Check-in was not smooth| they said they don’t have the type of room requested available and would upgrade to a suite. When I got to the suite it wasn’t definitely what I wanted. I called from the room and then it was magically found what I wanted a corner room. But now I ha e to carry all my stuff from on side of the building to another. It gets better before I can get my things and leave the room. We hear another couple is already checked into our old room. Wow. All staff is great especially house keeping but checkin staff is another story.,Jan 2| 2020,4
I have stayed at this hotel multiple times and it is my favorite for all my trips to New York. The room is spacious compared to most hotel rooms in New York. The front desk staff is ok not great but they get the job done fast.,Dec 31| 2019,5
Very clean cozy and beautiful view y we have everything very close to the place where we want to go,Dec 29| 2019,5
Great service| food| beautiful view from room! Will definitely stay here again when visiting the city!,Dec 27| 2019,5
This hotel must have nice rooms but the one assigned to me was just awful. Tiny| sparse with a narrow row of windows you'd see on a Greyhound bus. There was a piece of plasterboard at the end of the row of windows that was not secured with a wire sticking out.This hotel is for diplomats at the UN? Then whom might they stick in a room like this? Never| ever again would I stay here.,Dec 26| 2019,1
We had a corner room on 39th floor had great views however the soundproofing had a lot to be desired.  Could hear the people in the next room as clear as day and people in hallway.  At night the light from the hallway shone through the edges of the door and we had to put a towel along bottom of door to stop the draft coming through.  The fridge smelt like rotten fish they came and cleaned it twice but the smell never went away.,Dec 22| 2019,3
Overall hotel was dirty| especially the carpets. Very noisy location. Wouldn’t go back.,Dec 16| 2019,2
Old| badly maintained| overpriced| overrated and zero service,Dec 16| 2019,1
Location is great.It appears that room maintenance needs more attention.,Dec 16| 2019,3
The service is not Hilton’s standard. Staff should be Re-trained.,Dec 12| 2019,3
Stay was most relaxing. Staff very cordial. Hilton has to stop charging guests for wi fi service in their rooms.,Dec 9| 2019,5
Room was a great size-comfortable beds!,Dec 9| 2019,4
Beautiful view and room nice technology bathroom  everything very closer  and a lot security,Dec 3| 2019,5
Hated this property would never stay again from the time I pulled up I felt like I didn’t belong and was sniffed by a police dog soon as I got out the cab,Dec 3| 2019,1
Rented a corner room with the most perfect view. The sunset was definitely in our favor those days.,Dec 3| 2019,5
We rented a suite to accommodate our adult daughter| the room was spacious|but|the pull out sofa was broken and so a roll-a-way was brought.  There went the space.  Also| had some trouble understanding the staff.  Though I’m sure they work hard|especially being a holiday weekend | their English was a struggle .,Dec 1| 2019,4
The staff are not polite. Do not expect a "Good morning  or Good afternoon|" I believe they do not know these words. The restaurant is small but convenient. The menu is not abundant (they have very specific dishes). On the other hand| when my wife and I arrived at the property| there was a guy with a dog at the entrance. This person without introducing himself| he told us to stop. Then| he said "my dof needs to sniff your luggage." I understand this for the safety of the guests| but the way he approached to us was a little bit aggressive. I mean: the person was very impolite. The location is very convenient! The manager of the bar was the only person extremely polite with the guests. Thanks for taking your time reading my review!,Dec 1| 2019,3
Fantastic concierge service| great room| nice view good location,Nov 30| 2019,5
Slight difficulty getting through on their phone system| I had to keep asking the operator to transfer me. Was as able to check in early though which was a huge help especially with a baby.,Nov 30| 2019,4
유엔본부 바로 앞이라 시내로 나가기 좋았습니다. 근처 m42번 버스타면 맨하탄 중심가로 20분내로 갈수 잇어요,Nov 29| 2019,5
The picture was a lie look nothing like the picture,Nov 25| 2019,3
I thought our was amazing it was our anniversary and staff treated from well I would recommend This hotel to all my friends and family,Nov 25| 2019,5
The view is by far one of the best. I'm also very happy with the cleanliness. For me it was not a long walk to the stores and shows on Broadway.,Nov 24| 2019,5
We were so pleased with the friendliness of all staff members we encountered.,Nov 22| 2019,4
Overall good but management needs to better keep an eye on condition of the room many equipment is starting to age and would need to be checked or replaced (handles in shower| usb outlets not working|) for such prize would be also good to have some complementary water,Nov 22| 2019,4
Comfortable| convenient| and the views can't be beat. Would be nice if there were free wifi in the room.,Nov 18| 2019,4
Everything was fantastic especially the friendliness of the staff| in particular one of the valets| Eddie! If there was one drawback we found the room stayed too warm at night despite  our attempts at adjusting the thermostat.,Nov 18| 2019,5
The view was amazing and the room was great. Clean| comfortable| stylish. I never sit on the couch in hotels| but this one we did!,Nov 18| 2019,5
Phenomenal view.  Would return for that alone.,Nov 18| 2019,4
Room was very dusty and the door for other rooms you could hear close| but it was loud. Also the bed was uncomfortable.,Nov 18| 2019,3
Hotel is modern| clean| staff is polite| best view from the room we had.,Nov 17| 2019,5
They overbooked our room| them put us in another room and on fallowing day move us from that room to another.The second nite the people on room next to us start to talk really loud and nasty ( we have kids).Really disappointed 😞,Nov 15| 2019,2
Room was very big| and the hotel was long on standard amenities that make it comfortable and convenient for business travelers.  Not trendy| but excellent and reasonably priced for the serious traveler.,Nov 13| 2019,5
We had a really bad experience! We arrived at around 5pm and they didn’t have a room ready for us. Apparently| they were changing from heating to cooling and half of the hotel was shut. We had to wait for 3 hours in the lobby with our 2 young kids until we got a room. The worst of it was that they didn’t tell us to come later. They just kept telling us that they will have a room for us “shortly”.  Finally| when we got a room the room was dirty as apparently house keeping was short staffed due to the long weekend. On our second day our room want serviced at all| although we left early and returned late. In general| it seems that the only department that did work that day was the billing department as the charges were correct…We were offered a free night voucher to any Hilton in the US as compensation that was supposed to be sent from Hilton corporate| but like the hotel’s conduct during our stay| this voucher never arrived (its been 6 months) although we’ve followed up 5 times with Tyera Brown the assistant manager that offered us the voucher.It is bad enough not to provide good service during the hotel stay| but this hotel team’s conduct after the stay actually shows that they just don’t care!,Nov 12| 2019,1
Beautiful view!  Comfortable and quiet| and a short run from the park.  Staff friendly and helpful.   Exercise room was pretty well-equipped; sunrise was stunning!  Two things I wish had been different; ZERO food available after 11:00 pm| and public transportation wasn’t convenient.  No pool| but about 4 blocks from a very nice Y.,Nov 11| 2019,5
Efficient| business like| nicely appointed spacious (corner) room| clean| sterile atmosphere.,Nov 11| 2019,4
There was no fridge in our room. The coffee machine wasn’t working properly.,Nov 11| 2019,3
Close to UN.  Efficient design.  Room very nice.  View from 35th floor of East River| city buildings was spectacular.  However| hallways looking worn.,Nov 10| 2019,5
No especial care from any of the staff,Nov 10| 2019,4
a few blocks from grand central station.  price was good.  booked room with ability to cancel without penalty.,Nov 9| 2019,5
The front desk staff were absolutely gracious and professional.  The Bell Captain - Ozzie - could not have been more helpful given my challenges of walking with a new knee.  He was knowledgeable and ye not overbearing with respect to his joy of working at this hotel for 40 plus years.  He was kind enough to introduce me to the general manager as I left.  Despite my desire to show my appreciation with a gratuity| he refused to accept it and said| the conversation about diplomacy with me had much greater value.  Pls. share with Ozzie my assessment.   Thank you,Nov 5| 2019,5
the front desk associate would not let me use the bathroom before I checked in and got my card. when I told him that I had been in the car for 4 hours and needed to use the restroom he made me check in | and then gave me a bathroom card| which he followed me to the bathroom and then made me give it back to him immediately. he said people came in and used them for their restrooms| and he wouldn't let me do that| even after I checked in.,Nov 5| 2019,1
Housekeeping was good| but I DID NOT appreciate them coming in our rooms unannounced.  They would open the door the as they said| “housekeeping”.  Courtesy says they knock and say| “housekeeping”| wait at least 10 seconds| knock again and state “housekeeping”| wait| and if no response THEN they may enter.  Please| no more simply opening the door unannounced!,Nov 5| 2019,3
This hotel is lovely. It’s on a quiet street yet within walking distance of where you want to be. The rooms are spacious and very clean.  We also had a good view of the river and NYC skyline.  The hotel’s restaurant and lounge we enjoyed (and the bartender was great!).  We frequently come to NYC to visit our son/family. I believe this is our new “go to” place to stay!,Nov 4| 2019,5
Was very happy with the hilton clean tidy and comfortable room was a little tired in places but would definitely stay there again,Nov 3| 2019,4
Location is excellent within walking distance of many businesses. The building is dated and the rooms need upgrading| especially the carpet in the room is stained and smells. Staff are great.,Oct 30| 2019,4
This hotel is in a great location and the staff we met were outstanding. The room was clean and well-equipped (coffee maker was not working so they brought us a new one) with a great view of the East River. Also Keats pub around the corner for cocktails and John’s restaurant on the corner does a great breakfast. I will definitely stay in this hotel again.,Oct 27| 2019,5
I had a reservation for 3 nights my flight was delayed and had a late arrival.  due to the rain they had roof leaks and sold out on rooms and to my surprise had no room and my daughter and I had to sleep in the lobby till 5 am and was told I would get a refund on first night which hasn’t happened. And when I asked abt my refund at check out the person was so rude about it and said they didn’t charge the first night when they actually did.,Oct 24| 2019,1
Everything was perfect other than that a bath plug won’t work by which I could not soak in the bath. So bummed out...,Oct 23| 2019,4

Bathroom floor not cleanCoffee cup (with white "top" had a dirty cup underneath,Oct 17| 2019,4
Amazing views| easy| seamless check in. My only concerns were: $15 a day for Wifi| no ice machines| the ice bucket they brought was paper and leaked throughout the night so it was ALL over everything in the morning| and when the cleaning people came they did not pick up or replenish towels| simply made the bed. We were really looking forward to new towels| and for the wet dirty ones to be picked up.,Oct 15| 2019,4
The room was huge| and bedding was very comfortable. We would definitely stay here again,Oct 15| 2019,5
Excellent location and close to UN. Excellent front desk staff| very helpful and respond quickly.,Oct 14| 2019,5

Loved the staff| service| and room! Great location!Great stay except huge roach in lobby!,Oct 9| 2019,5
The room was huge| modern and luxurious| with the comfiest bed I’ve ever slept in.  The staff were extremely friendly and always happy to help.  The hotel is just a 10 minute walk from Grand Central Station| so it’s easy to get around the city.  The best part is the views! Stunning views of midtown| especially at night!,Oct 7| 2019,5
Shower was confusing to get on but the view more than makes up for the awkwardness of the hardware.,Oct 5| 2019,5
Its good enough,Oct 3| 2019,4
It was a good 2 days that we had in the hotel they had an event going on| was crowded but fin,Oct 1| 2019,4
The staff was so nice and patient with me. No matter the question they had a very helpful answer. First time staying at this location and i can definitely see myself doing it again.,Sep 30| 2019,5
Our room was so spacious and looked recently renovated. Had a fantastic view of the Empire State Building from our room. Bed was comfortable and room clean. Staff very helpful| and the cafe on site was good for coffee and snacks. Room service for food was only during limited hours| and didn’t have much to choose from. Location was really close to central station| only a 5-10 minute walk away. Would stay again,Sep 27| 2019,5
I loved the rooms and the amazing city views. I also found the customer service & friendliness of the staff (including the bellmen| the front desk staff & housekeeping staff) to be particularly stellar!,Sep 24| 2019,5
Great location over looking the United Nations Building. Easy access to the centre of Manhattan located on 44th St straight walk into Time Square.Hotel has amazing views of the city and recommend booking the corner rooms.,Sep 23| 2019,5
Everyone was very helpful and courteous   Great location,Sep 23| 2019,5

Pretty good Warm and  friendly  staff.,Sep 17| 2019,4
Good property| nice rooms| but needs upgrading. Carpets smell... Very clean bedding and bathrooms are very nice. Staff is very accommodating| they provided fabulous service. Just the property is run-down.,Sep 15| 2019,4
Booked and paid ahead for a corner king room. When  I checked in I was informed that my room was longer available. Had to settle for a standard queen. To compensate they offered me free buffet breakfast. Not a create deal for a vegan. Very disappointing.,Sep 11| 2019,1
WOW!! not this is a hotel!! smells great! great location! great accommodations !! great GREAT room and the VIEW!! loved and enjoyed everyday!!,Sep 10| 2019,5
The room and view were fantastic.,Sep 9| 2019,5
The hotel overall was good| but comfort wise was not that great. The a/c in our room didn't work properly and it was super humid and warm. After complaining for the 3rd time| we were given a discount on the room.,Sep 6| 2019,4
Everyone was very helpful and accommodating to all of our requests. We didn’t have a King size room and we asked to see if we could upgrade. The front desk girl was supper helpful and got us a king size room on the top floor with a view of the city. It was perfect. We could see the Chrysler Bldg and the Empire State Bldg from our window.,Sep 5| 2019,5
Very basic hotel and more like a 3 star. Room had continuous drilling or a jack hammer noises that wouldn’t stop beyond 11pm. Got stuck in the elevator and it was one of the worst experiences ever.,Sep 4| 2019,1
Rooms were nice and clean| and staff were friendly and a pleasure to interact with. Overall a nice and enjoyable experience.,Sep 3| 2019,5
If you book via third party website there service is horrible,Sep 3| 2019,2
The views were amazing from my room. I like the little coffee shop next to the lobby. They're often the morning for a coffee and baked good I do not recommend getting the breakfast buffet at the restaurant they charge me $42 for one person and the food was not really that good I thought I was extremely expensive for one person to have a breakfast buffet.,Sep 3| 2019,4
Convenient location for someone who is here for business at the UN. Good rooms. Good service. Good in room coffee service. Cleaners just need to make sure they take every used objects (i.e. towels) left by previous guest. But altogether| first time experience was a positive one.,Aug 31| 2019,5
We had a old mini bar refrigerator in our room. Ddn't really keep things to cold. No microwave. The coffee machne had to be switched out. It was a place to stay.,Aug 27| 2019,3
The city view is amazing stuff was great all in all was great experience,Aug 25| 2019,5
We like it because it's in ther quiet side of Midtown Manhattan. The staff are very friendly.,Aug 23| 2019,5
Rooms large| just a little tired| other than that it would be a beautiful hotel,Aug 21| 2019,4
We arrived at the hotel 14:45 on Saturday| usual checkin fine| my old mum | 75+| reduced mobility| wants to use the restroom. and a whole drama unfolds| no step free restrooms| are available| I ask reception for help | reception calls security to escort my mum| security responds| 7-10 minutes later| by which time | my mum takes the stairs as the alternative is worse at great pain and discomfort. . We come back to hotel at 1800| our rooms are not ready we keep waiting for the room 15-20 minutesNext day| No step free access to breakfast | well done| call security secutity turns up in 3 minutes. went back to hotel to pick bags and we ask to use restroom as I spot the security is right there should be a problem right? Wrong security leaves my mum at the restroom door and disappears| 15 minutes later I receive phone call from my mum? there is no one here how do I go back to you? as security had just left. Bell boys help search for my mum and we find her.So if you are disabled| mobility impaired| or travelling with older relatives do not use this hotel,Aug 20| 2019,1
Amazing| polite & professional staff/ workers. All very welcoming & helpful. Room was great however carpet in room needs to be replaced.. definitely old & outdated. Hotel gym has a great view.. and has machines & weights to get the job done. Overall| we will return to this property.,Aug 20| 2019,5
Good location and clean rooms.I did have a great view of sunrise over the East River,Aug 20| 2019,4
The Millennium Hilton is conveniently located in Midtown East near the United Nations. You can also easily access many Broadway theaters from there. The Millennium is clean and well maintained. My room| however not huge as it is NYC| was spacious enough and had a beautiful bathroom. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I would stay there again!,Aug 16| 2019,5
We stayed in NYC for one night and loved this hotel. The staff were amazing and our stay was lovely.,Aug 15| 2019,5

View wasn’t bad but my boyfriend had a Ralph Lauren polo shirt on the bed when we left to go visit family and when we came back housekeeping had cleaned the room and magically his shirt disappeared. I called laundry and housekeeping to see if they accidentally took it with the sheets. They couldn’t locate it and suggested we tell a manager. When we spoke to the manager about it she shrugged her shoulders and basically told us too bad.... the shirts easily replaceable| it was the way the manager of all people handled the situation.... we won’t be back again.,Aug 11| 2019,1
The decor of the lobby was beautiful|the staff were friendly.     The only thing i didn't like was there was only expresso in the room with no option for coffee,Aug 11| 2019,5
+It was very quiet and close to the subway.-There wasn’t much shopping near by the hotel.,Aug 9| 2019,5
Nice location| good view| Hilton standard but wifi more or less didn't work in our room all 4 days and nights we stayed at this 5 star Hilton and no one felt responsible. They said: wifi is free so if it doesn't work it doesn't matter. For a business hotel it's not a convincing answer.,Aug 6| 2019,4
The room was not clean as was the bathroom and the bed was uncomfortable,Aug 5| 2019,3
The toilets were cool.  Never used a bidet before.  $15 for internet?  Ridiculous!,Aug 5| 2019,4
Hotel was great except the staff. Staff( receptionist) was not friendly and did not even look at my eye while talking. She left even before I finished the question about the room. Someone else next to her answered it for me. Internet was not working somehow throughout the stay(despite going through the correct steps with the help of the guy on the lobby of the hotel),Aug 3| 2019,5
It was an amazing room with view ...but it could use a pool,Aug 1| 2019,4
Did not feel the worth for the money i have spent. For the lower price Marriot is most excellent than this. Also it looks posh only at ground floor not the above floors,Jul 31| 2019,3
Easy staff and service ..nice place to stay I love the view from the outside ...fantastic !!,Jul 31| 2019,5
The view of my room was spectacular and the service was beyond unbelievable. after driving three hours from Pennsylvania we were greeted very nicely by the bell men and he opened my car door and got my bags out of the car. And the room was just spectacular.,Jul 31| 2019,5
I was expecting more amenities in our room( the bed was comfortable though). Check in was a little bit disappointing. Our room wasn’t ready when we got there| so we had to leave our bags with bell hop and find something to do until we were able to check in which was an inconvenience because we weren’t able to shower or change our clothes we had been traveling for almost 7 hours. Then they charged my card twice. It’s been a week and still haven’t received my deposit or my refund for the overcharged.,Jul 30| 2019,2
The hotel was nice and the staff was great and very helpful. I loved the touch screen features in the room. Besides not being able to check-in early| everything else about the hotel was amazing. Would recommend to stay here!,Jul 30| 2019,5
I stay Millennium Hilton New York One often for business but this time took my family.  It is an excellent hotel| very clean and well run.  However the valet parking service is terrible!  I actually had to walk to the park lotm with the doorman| when it took over 20 mins for my car to be brought out.  Under any circumstances that is a ridiculous amount of time.  I had actually seen poor reviews for the valet service| but tried it anyway.  The poor reviews were accurate.  I will still stay at Millennium Hilton New York One| but I will NEVER use the valet service again...  No-one should...,Jul 29| 2019,4
I liked the location. I didn't like the limited dining in menu. The customer service wasn't the best but the manager made up for it at checkout.,Jul 25| 2019,4
We have been staying at the Millenium for the last Four years.  We live everything about it.  The hotel| staff and location are FABULOUS.  Try it out| you won’t regret it!,Jul 23| 2019,5
Very nice friendly staff at the hotel.My room was close to elevator so|little too noisy even after 10pm|I can hear several people talking.So many long hairs in bathroom| I was wondering cleaning stuff really vacuumed my room or not...,Jul 22| 2019,3

Ideal hotel when attending meetings etc at the UN.,Jul 13| 2019,5
The room was a good size especially for NYC. Staff were very nice and helpful. The GYM had amazings views.,Jul 9| 2019,5
Great hotel! Our concierge Brandon made us feel right at home as we walked through the doors. The bed was very comfortable| the rooms were very clean.,Jul 9| 2019,5
All in all a great hotel to stay at. After spending 5 nights in New York where we were doing 20k steps a day| we wish it was closer to the Metro.,Jul 7| 2019,4
The location is fantastic. We usually stay further up near the park| but from now on this is where we will stay. The room had a fantastic view. It was very comfortable. The only thing I wasn't that happy about was that to get ice| we had to call the bellmen and it seemed as if that was not a part of their job that they liked. It also took a long time for them to bring up the ice. I would much prefer to be able to get it myself. I would say that every staff member I encountered was very nice and helpful except the bellmen. They were not helpful when I arrived| and were just neutral throughout the stay. They were standing around talking at night when I'd arrive back from a walk| and never greeted me. I think having more friendly members of your staff greet your guests would have been an added plus.,Jul 6| 2019,4
We swapped rooms because there was a wet dirty towel with hair still hanging over the shower| the sink and the shower wouldn’t drain. When we switched rooms we got back into it at night and found out there wasn’t any shampoo and conditioner that they said they would bring up. That wasn’t a big deal but we called down and it took over an hour to get it to the room. No fitted sheets on the bed| not sure if that’s just what this hotel does but I’m not a fan of touching the mattress. Staff was nice. Overall was a nice place but must have just caught it on an off weekend. Good location in order to get around. Valet was efficient and timely.,Jul 3| 2019,3
Great location and great views. Great place for a weekend in NYC. Super Helpful staff.,Jul 3| 2019,5
I stay here frequently because it is convenient to Grand Central Station| yet a little ways apart from the hustle and bustle.  The one drawback always experience has difficulty with the Wi-Fi. It is often spotty| frequently takes a very long time connect,Jul 3| 2019,4
While the green marble to me back to the days of the Carrington's| the staff and the shape of the hotel were delightful.,Jul 3| 2019,5
It’s a business hotel| service is as good as it can gets. Contacted the hotel in advance for some shopping to be delivered prior to check in date| was never informed about additional charge. However at check out| the receptionist was trying to charge me $35. Explained to her the situation| she offered to charge me $7 instead. Really annoyed with these sorted of hidden charges...,Jul 2| 2019,3
Had a river view which was outstanding. Hotel spotless| modern and staff on the whole friendly.Room maids deserve a mention for their fantastic work and their friendliness and warmness..central to alot of planned attractions we wanted to visit |felt safe in the area . Definitely worth staying here highley recommemd,Jul 1| 2019,5
Good place ******* ******* ******** ********########,Jul 1| 2019,4
I loved my stay here. I'm not sure if this was a feature in every room| but I loved the automated curtains in the room| and the toilet with a bidet function. I also loved how accessible the property was to all of New York; less than ten minutes to Grand Central Station where you could catch a train to Downtown Manhattan| out to Queens or to the north suburbs on the Metro North line. The property sits 15 mins from Times Square. The staff was incredibly friendly| from checking in to heading out and willing to flag down a taxi (even in this day of Uber). I cannot wait to stay here again.,Jun 30| 2019,5
Peaceful location next to UN. Unexpected calmness in the busy city. Hotel is more spacious than most in NYC.,Jun 28| 2019,5
Todo me gusto solo que dicen que ay algunas cosas gratis y no es así lo siento es mi experiencia por lo demás es excelente,Jun 28| 2019,3
Great location | restaurants and bars in walking distance|,Jun 26| 2019,4
We booked for two nights. The room was great| the bed was comfy and staff was pleasant and helpful. I would stay here again!,Jun 24| 2019,4
We felt truly comfortable| we will return. We recommend it completely.,Jun 24| 2019,5
It was in a location I had never stayed before in NYC. The views were spectacular! People were helpful and friendly. We enjoyed our stay,Jun 24| 2019,5
Extremely satisfied with this property. Incredible view| clean and modern rooms| and quiet. It was so great we wish we could have spent more than just the weekend to explore everything the hotel had to offer. Beds were super comfortable and everything  was amazing for such a fair price in NYC. Close to the subway too. Recommended to all our family and friends.,Jun 24| 2019,5
Internet is terrible vs most other properties that I've staid at in the past.,Jun 23| 2019,3
Great Location with great views| only 5 min walk from Grand Central,Jun 22| 2019,4
Great location| could walk to everything. Lots of shopping and restaurants near by. Room was ok was on the east river side great view but room could have been updated more. Park on the street cost for valet is to high and you don’t have in and out privileges. Didn’t eat the breakfast because that is pricey as well there is plenty of places to eat near by.,Jun 18| 2019,4
Wonderful hotel| had corner room with beautiful views and nice accommodations.,Jun 18| 2019,5
The room and facility was very nice.  The coffee area in the room was not clean and didn't look like it had been cleaned in a while.,Jun 18| 2019,5
Our rom was fantastic! The staff was lovely.Had issues with costs at lounge and Resturant. Elevators are painfully slow.Housekeeping was average only making bed and leaving towel.,Jun 17| 2019,3
The staff was very friendly and helpful| but the room was not cleaned from the previous guests. There was still dirty coffee cups.  The front desk sent someone up immediately to rectify that.,Jun 17| 2019,4
Last minute booking.  Convenient walk to local destinations.  Nice view of Long Island,Jun 15| 2019,5
My room wasn’t ready at my 5’pm arrival. The light switches are strange and some of the bulbs didn’t work| and my first call to notify that my cable wasn’t working was ignored. Other than that| overall it was a good location| the room was nice| but I wouldn’t want to stay in a corner room again so I can get a full view rather than partial.,Jun 13| 2019,4
it is good and pleasant close to the united Nations,Jun 11| 2019,4
Nice room|great views|friendly staff. 15 min walk to 5th ave,Jun 10| 2019,4
I was to get a two bed room and got one bed with a pull out couch. I had to call to request the extra bedding. They just dropped off the bedding and didn’t even make it up. I also was told on checkin that my room was ready but it would be $100 more to checkin early. I declined. They asked for a $50 deposit and charged my credit card. I didn’t charge anything and at the end I asked them about the $50 and he said they would credit it back. My car parking was charged more for being oversized..SUV. When I went to ask for my car at checkout| the bell hop told me to go to the main desk| the main desk told me to wait outside. After waiting outside for a bit I went back in and at that time the bell hop helped me. The service overall was not what I know Hilton to provide so it was disappointing. I also had to call back to the front desk to ask what the Honors free WiFi password is. Just another example of poor service.,Jun 9| 2019,3
The views from room 3727 were breathtaking! Corner room on the 37th floor and it was truly marvelous!,Jun 8| 2019,5
Great views and location! The breakfast at the lounge could have had more selection but was sufficient.,Jun 8| 2019,5
Fantastic view of downtown Manhattan from the 32nd floor !,Jun 6| 2019,4
Beautiful and clean building. Linens were heaven to sleep on.,Jun 5| 2019,4
The reservation printout from Hotels.com said that there is free WIFI| but the hotel charged me anyway...! When I showed them the reservation from Hotels.com they said that I have to talk to the Hotels.com to get a refund for the WIFI fee....!!!I will never again use Hotels.com for my hotel reservations.,Jun 3| 2019,1
When we arrived to check in we were told that the hotel was overbooked and there were no rooms available. The manager apologized and said they would put us up in a Hyatt across town for the night and then we would be transferred back to the Millenium Hilton the following day. We made it clear that this was absolutely unacceptable as we chose the hotel specifically for its location on the east side and it was a huge inconvenience to have to unpack/repack/unpack our things because of their mistake. Then they magically “found” a room but it needed to be cleaned and this took an hour and a half. They compensated us by giving us 50% off for that night and free breakfast in the morning. I knew airlines oversold flights but had no idea that hotels did.,Jun 3| 2019,3
room was very good| view was astonishing| yet it was a room for 4p and there were only 2 cups for coffee| no bottles of water| no shower bands for head| WIFi was poor at the 35th floor| and cleanliness could be improved.,Jun 2| 2019,5
Great staff who really do try and help.,Jun 2| 2019,4
Beautiful rooms| great location| friendly staff. Quiet. A great experience,Jun 2| 2019,5
The hotel has one pretty poor quality eatery. As it’s in a business area that is a pity - Not eaAt to get an evening meal after a long days work.,Jun 2| 2019,4
There was an abnormal waiting time at reception.The calls made to housekeeping were 9 out of ten times unanswered. The tea maker was splattering hot water all over and the variety of tea sugar and accessories was negligible,Jun 1| 2019,3
you should have a bigger lobby| the rest was very good,May 28| 2019,5
Perfect location with an incredible view.,May 28| 2019,5
Love the hotel | really friendly staff and super very safe area will stay again   !,May 28| 2019,5
Spent memorial weekend with my husband celebrating our anniversary. We had an amazing view room. I was missing the microwave. Room wad OK about the size. Service wad great.,May 28| 2019,5
Had to wait to check in for several hours.  Staff not very helpful.,May 27| 2019,3
I liked the location of this hotel. I didn’t like that fact that the hotel is outdated.,May 26| 2019,4
Horrible decor and design. Over priced for its condition.,May 26| 2019,2
I checked in on Sunday May 19th and checked out May 2oth 2019. Although I had prepaid my booking with Hotels.com I was charged USD$400.00 as a preauthorization in case I had a late checkout. Upon checking out as no late checkout 4 days later the USD400.00 hold was released and only charged the USD$55.00 for parking. All good untill a USD$286.88 showed up as a hold on a late checkout that never happened. I called Millenium Hilton and they indicated it was a mistake and charges were to be reversed ASAP. On the next day charges were still there and once again I asked Hotels.com to handle the matter. They were told a FLAT LIE| and to this date I am veing charged a second time for something that never happened. Either Hotels.com is in cohoots or the Hilton really needs the money. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!!!,May 25| 2019,4
The view from the hotel room was amazing! (My room faced the south) only thing I was a little bit disappointed was room service. I should call at least twice to ask something I needed. If you can ask some stuffs you want during check in (for examples| slippers and microwave (need to pay additionally))| it would be better.,May 23| 2019,4
Great location| confortable| clean. Good services. Our room has a wonderful view.,May 21| 2019,5
Lovely| top notch staff. The lobby cafe had an excellent barista. Cheerful| professional| and good sense of humor. The coffee machines in the room were not that useful as they only make espresso. The rooms were a little dated without USB ports to charge your devices.,May 20| 2019,4
Very Beautiful facilities. Would have like to have a full bar but very nice nonetheless. Excellent staff support and super friendly. We felt extremely at home from the front desk| to the doorman to the Housekeeping Staff. Can’t wait to see them all again!,May 20| 2019,5
We really enjoyed our stay there. Great rooms| view| location and staff.,May 20| 2019,5
Family reunion.  The hotel was very elegant and the wrap around windows and views were amazing,May 19| 2019,5
Location for us is perfect|would  come back for sure next year,May 19| 2019,5
Amazing!  This property was super friendly and helpful| I felt right at home right away.  All of the staff made me feel welcome and was so nice.  I would definitely recommend this as a place to stay!!  xoxox,May 17| 2019,5
All we knew was that it is an not so cheap hotel near the U.N. Plaza. As we arrived| Robert greeted us and| suddenly| the hotel became friendly. The check-in was quick| we asked for a room at an upper floor and we received one on the 37-th. The view was breathtaking| the room large and clean| the wi-if pretty fast. Waking up in the morning was a unique experience| the first thing we saw being the Manhattan skyline. We had breakfast across the street| at Mona’s. The Central Station is two blocks away but the neighborhood is quiet and safe.,May 13| 2019,5
My second stay in this property| previous stay was in 2017 when Hilton was not involved with it yet. This review is for my stay in May 2019. Everything was good about my stay. From the sense of security with the sniffer dog at the entrance to the comfort of the bed and pillows. The room felt clean and well taken care of. The water pressure in the shower was great and the view was wonderful. In my six nights here| nothing went wrong so really| nothing negative about this place.,May 8| 2019,4
We loved the customer service and the the personal attention we received. There was a man named Frank that especially fantastic! However| the toilet was kept running after it was flushed| and there were several places in the room that did not seem clean.,May 7| 2019,4
We stayed for 2 nights| good location and dissent rooms with good view.Disappointed with a breakfast service. Went for continental breakfast. Server brought us a check for much more expensive one. I told him to get we a correct check. He brought the check| I crossed out the gratuity from the check| because it was not earned. at the checkout clerk run the charge for the full amount with gratuity| which i  crossed out. When I mentioned that she said that I need to go to the restaurant and straighten it out with them. Is that a level of service for 4 star hotel or more like "Econolodge". Please improve your training for people providing service.,May 6| 2019,3
Overall it is a good stay experienceTwo things are slightly compromising the reputation here1. Bell boys are not nice| even after tipping| you still felt no welcome2. Air-con in the room is a bit loud| i felt difficult in falling asleep.,May 3| 2019,4
Views was exceptional great location friendly staff,Apr 30| 2019,5
Blood stains on comforter,Apr 30| 2019,2
Sightseeing anniversary,Apr 29| 2019,5
Nice hotel| room was amazing| really large - overlooking NYC and Empire State Building - just exactly what I was after for celebrating my husbands 40th.  The gym was ideal with modern cardio and weight equipment and an amazing view of the river and the city.  Young lady on guest relations was a disappointment| very unhelpful| unfriendly and poor customer service| otherwise everyone else was very welcoming and pleasant.  Close enough to Grand Central to catch the subway and found a couple of lovely places for breakfast and dinner along the way.  Would definitely return here in future.  Its a shame that you charge for wifi (unless sat in Reception where it is free)| wifi is somewhat considered a given now in prestigious hotels.  Really like the in room option to bluetooth the music on your phone to the television sound system - that worked really well.  Just a shame no free wifi to support it.,Apr 29| 2019,5
Upon check in we noticed that the "double beds" were smaller than what we thought we booked.  When we spoke to the manager| Tai| she was very unprofessional| rude and unapologetic.  She told us that was their idea of a double bed.   We did speak Steve who is also a manager the next day and he was very nice and considerate.  I visit NY very often and will not be staying at this hotel again.,Apr 29| 2019,2
Great property. Excellent location.  Service Staff wonderful.,Apr 29| 2019,5
Friendly FOH staff - we've stayed there often. Quiet as rooms only start on floor 28. Associated restaurant good but expensive,Apr 28| 2019,5
I liked the friendly people who greet you in. I did not appreciate the lack of sensitivity at the check-in to my late arrival.I liked the room view. I didn’t like the long wait with other guests for the elevator on 37th floor for 20 min without a practical reason. I enjoyed the restaurant buffet...hostess was excellent and assumed the needs without interaction...caused us to go back the next day...,Apr 28| 2019,5
Amazing view| comfortable room| awesome overall.,Apr 24| 2019,5
Great hotel in a great location. Friendly staff| quick check in| and views that  take your breath away. Convenient for midtown Manhatten| close to subways. No complaints at all. Will stay here again| the next time we visit New York.,Apr 24| 2019,5
The staff were amazing| the location perfect| the facility well maintained| the breakfast was excellent the room was ample| clean and comfortable. I could not fault this hotel. We were really happy that we chose it. I know this sounds like a "fake" review but it is not. Paulo,Apr 23| 2019,5
We had two rooms.  The rooms didn't have dressers with drawers| no small refrigerators| dusty rooms (needs dusting)| the beds seem to have been two full beds instead of two queen bed.,Apr 22| 2019,3
The location is great for getting into Manhattan centre. The hotel rooms are lovely. The facilities in the bathroom need updating. Our toilet seat had a crack.On checking| one of the two rooms bathroom facilities was dirty. The toilet was not cleaned and there was urine on the toilet floor and faeces in the toilet. (Room 3210)The other room (3408) had the crockery from room service of the adjacent room lying in the corridor for three days before it was removed.The breakfast was expensive for the limited choices and quality of food.These experiences were very disappointing for an otherwise good service.,Apr 22| 2019,2
Hotel was great| just should have booked one closer to midtown.  We ended up doing far too many cabs to get places.  Could not believe there was no WiFi included in price.  I joined Hilton honors to get free WiFi.,Apr 15| 2019,4
Clean and overall good stay. Overpriced for early check-ins,Apr 15| 2019,4
good place. good service| good location. needs better access to pick up food.,Apr 11| 2019,4
Everything about the hotel was amazing| the only thing we found as a slight negative is that there weren’t subway stations nearby that we could see but everything was perfect. Comfy bed and pillows| excellent view (we had the king size room with a view of the Hudson) although we did ask for a room with a view of the NY skyline hence booked a king size room (which we didn’t get but we didn’t mind).,Apr 10| 2019,5
My family and I had an amazing stay.The views are amazing.,Apr 9| 2019,5
Checking in didn’t feel welcoming...person who checked me in didn’t look happy to be there. No warm smile or hello. Room was clean. I had a nice view of the East River| Empire State Building| and Chrysler Building from my window. Very noisy guests in the hallways made it hard sleep at night. Got a lot of attitude from the cabbies parked outside of hotel...they didn’t want to take me| because I was going to 60th and Broadway| instead of the airport.,Apr 8| 2019,3
This place was absolutely perfect. Great staff and beautiful room with a panoramic view of the city. Our room was actually upgraded to a suite when we checked in and was a great surprise.,Apr 7| 2019,5
Everything was wonderful. The hotel view was amazing and also clean. Staff were also very respectful. I would definitely stay again,Apr 5| 2019,5
Staff were very accommodating and friendly.  Thank you!,Apr 3| 2019,5
The hotel was beautiful with a lovely view. The service wasn’t soo great. They are very slow. When I checked out I waited 20 minutes for the person in front of me| another 20 minutes when it was my turn he told me his computer was down and was working on it| not only that| gave him my valet ticket to pick up my car | waited another 30 minutes | so I finally went outside to tell the valet guy| the front desk never even called it in . Very frustrating check out.,Apr 1| 2019,3
I was only here a day. The staff were courteous and accommodated my early check in. The room was nice and clean. Overall a positive experience.,Mar 31| 2019,5
The staff was not helpful! The room was okay. The view was nice,Mar 30| 2019,3

Our stay was beyond amazing| location was great walking distance to everything| the check in process was wonderful I was actually able to check in 2-3 hours early with no extra charge. They held our luggage before and after our check out times. The staff was wonderful so nice and helpful. I would definitely stay at this hotel again and highly recommend it.,Mar 26| 2019,5
Very helpful and pleasant staff. Rooms were clean and nicely decorated. Small| but to be expected in NYC,Mar 25| 2019,4
Great location. Clean and spacious rooms. Staff is friendly. The lobby is a bit small and crowded. Will stay again.,Mar 25| 2019,5
It's usual standard but compare to the price it's not worth.,Mar 25| 2019,4
The view from the window was really beautiful. The room was lovely| clean| and very comfortable. The service was great. I would definitely stay there again.,Mar 24| 2019,5
The hotel stay was good| I just happened to be in the area during a very rainy period that prevented outdoor activities when not in meetings.,Mar 24| 2019,5

Terrific hotel close to the United Nations that offers top-notch security| service| and local area. I loved my stay and the views of the East River| Roosevelt Island| Queens and Manhattan are incredible. I truly enjoyed it.  The bed and bedding was terrific| you get a huge flat screen| the internet is above average and housekeeping was terrific.,Feb 26| 2019,5
Location is great! Easily walkable to Grand Central Station and restaurants nearby.,Feb 26| 2019,3
It was just the prefect experience for my first time in New York.,Feb 26| 2019,5
I had a spacious and comfortable room with views of the east river. The hotel is in a nice neighborhood| walking distance from many bars/restaurants and the subway at grand central is easily accessible. Great for a weekend trip to NYC.,Feb 25| 2019,4
The view is beyond fantastic! The location to everything is great and the room and service was what you would want it to be.,Feb 25| 2019,5
Expected a bidet in my bathroom but found everyone room does not have one.  Unfortunate!,Feb 25| 2019,3
Everyone was super sweet and helpful. The location is a quick walk from grand central station| easy cafe downstairs to grab a coffee in the morning. Great view of the river from our room.,Feb 24| 2019,5
It is such a beautiful property. The staff| services| cleanliness| location and the view is amazing!! I highly recommend this hotel. You will not be disappointed!! I give them 5 stars!!,Feb 24| 2019,5
This is a fantastic hotel. Shadow of the UN| but none of the noise and aggravation usually associated with staying in NYC. The East Side has plenty of food and drink options for all meals| and is a quick walk to Midtown and other areas. Definitely recommend.,Feb 23| 2019,5
This is a nice place| I like it. I will recommend this hotel.,Feb 23| 2019,4
Overall I like it. Just| can you provide bottled water?,Feb 22| 2019,5
I recently completed a ten-night stay at the Millennium Hilton and absolutely loved it. The location is terrific as it is minutes away from Grand Central Terminal the Chrysler Building and the United Nations. The security at the hotel is remarkable| you will never feel safer and the views are to die for.The check-in was fast| we received complimentary internet because of our long stay and there are plenty of eateries. The housekeeping was exemplary| the employees at the desks were very friendly| the beds were comfortable| and the Wi-Fi and television were excellent.We had a terrific stay!,Feb 22| 2019,5
Do not stay at this hotel. Sheets were dirty| room was tiny (the size of a cabin on a ship) and the rooms overlooked construction. Worse experience. Ruined my anniversary.,Feb 22| 2019,1
the room was large and clean but did not have a fridge,Feb 21| 2019,4
Just a quick getaway to see a couple of Broadway shows and museums.,Feb 20| 2019,4
Beautiful hotel  great views corner room on 33 floor.,Feb 19| 2019,5
Great location| nearly to best NY places Poor customer service. Exemption of Brandon| the policeman and his fantastic dog| all others attendants were unsatisfactory,Feb 19| 2019,4
The view from our room was beautiful! You can see the Pepsi sign across the water as well as the UN building & all the car lights for miles straight up the avenue.,Feb 19| 2019,3
Great stay only one night clean very up to date and close to time square would definitely stay again,Feb 18| 2019,4
Location was within walking distant to area we wanted visit,Feb 18| 2019,4
Super helpful staff| very clean. Only bad thing was to couldn’t take a hot shower. Water was only luke warm.,Feb 14| 2019,4
Loved the friendly staff| cleanliness| and the location was perfect for walking! Would definitely come back!,Feb 13| 2019,5
Beautiful room and view! Staff was very friendly. Very nice/clean amenities.,Feb 12| 2019,5
All the staff were courteous and helpful – everyone including reception| bell desk| bar/restaurant and room cleaners.The hotel generally and our room in particular was clean and well appointed. Our only real grumble was with the 3rd party concierge. The young lady I spoke to on two or three occasions was never as helpful as Hilton's own staff. However| she did sell us tickets for the Empire State Building which saved us some queuing time at the venue| but didn’t point out that for a small additional fee| we could have had tickets for both a day and night visit – we only discovered that at the venue.Overall| the concierge issue was quite minor and we had a great 7 night stay.,Feb 12| 2019,5
The room was near the boiler room and there was a banging sound heard through the walls.  It would come and go and detracted from our stay.,Feb 11| 2019,3
Lovely service and rooms that resonates comfort and thought! Fantastic 1st impression by front desk that was bookended by the warmth of management on site| would stay here once more!,Feb 5| 2019,5
great service and roomcoffee maker was the only thing that didn't' work properly,Feb 4| 2019,5
Excellent clean nice people everything excellent definitely recommend this hotel,Jan 31| 2019,5
The gentleman in the coffee shop was outstanding.   The rooms looked a little outdated.,Jan 31| 2019,3
Very positive experience. The only area that needs obvious and immediate improvement is an increase in staffing at the check-in / check-out.,Jan 29| 2019,4
Our room was nothing like the photo we seen on Expedia housekeeping was awful we order pizza the pizza was still there until we threw it out the bed sheets had stained the bathroom had an awful urine smell that was coming out of the toilet the towel we will use was put back it was switched out for a clean one the carpet had toenail clipping and wasn't even vacuumed our room was pretty awful and tiny we asked if we can get another room and they told us no I wouldn't come back to this hotel and Expedia should have updated photos cause our room wasn't even close to the photos they have on their website. I am really disappointed,Jan 28| 2019,1
I felt that the facility was well run| there was nothing that i would change.  It was clean and well appointed.,Jan 28| 2019,5
The view from the 30th floor was incredible. I enjoyed being able to log into my own Netflix account while at the hotel. The location was superb.,Jan 27| 2019,5
Very nice hotel in a great location. We’d definitely stay again.,Jan 26| 2019,5
Great View of New York City! Hotel was clean. The staff was helpful and professional.,Jan 26| 2019,5
Slightly smaller rooms but well maintained and clean,Jan 25| 2019,4
Not a very pleasant stay,Jan 22| 2019,1
Overall the hotel was good.  It was a little strange that the room constantly "creaked" as the hotel was apparently swaying in the wind.  Also| one of the days the room hadn't been made up when we were out and we had to call housekeeping to get new towels.  There were no instructions for the "Japanese" toilet and so had to figure it out through trial and error.  It was very nice| but had about 10 different functions. The hotel is directly across the street from the United Nations| so would be a great place to stay for that.  Otherwise| the area is typical Manhattan - lots of bodegas| restaurants| etc.  The doormen are exceptional - friendly| lots of hustle| and very professional.,Jan 22| 2019,4
Loved this hotel!  Great view of the East River| the Empire State building and the Chrysler Building.  My view when I went to sleep was the Empire State Building.  WOW!!!!!!,Jan 22| 2019,5
It was clean| staff was friendly| good location.. I'd say the only negative was paying for wifi| we decided against it| but for the convenience fee of 50+ dollars a day| you'd imagine that wifi would be included.,Jan 21| 2019,5
My flight was delayed due to weather and business conflicts delays. Called the hotel the night before and asked if check out could be delayed by 2 hours. I was told that I could probably leave my bags and check in but was not given the courtesy to delay check out. I didn’t feel like wandering for two hours in the freezing weather so ended up paying an additional night. On top of that the vent in room 314 was so loud that it kept waking me up through the night.  The walls are so thin that I could hear the next rooms TV playing. I also called for coffee the next morning and was told there was no room service until dinner. Tried to reach concierge and no one answered. It was terrible and certainly not worth the price. Have no intentions of ever staying there again.,Jan 21| 2019,2
Weekend in the city| and a great base for activities. Some excellent restaurants and diners just a couple of blocks away. The top floors of the hotel have a great view either over the East River or west to the Chrysler Building.,Jan 21| 2019,5
Great hotel| location and price. I would definitely would stay again,Jan 21| 2019,5
Excellent service right from the moment we walked into reception. Staff are really friendly and the lovely lady behind front desk upgraded us to the 38th floor! It was a stunning view. The restaurant and bar is also fabulous. I will definitely book again| felt like royalty. Thank you Millennium Hilton staff for making us Brits feel welcome.,Jan 18| 2019,5
Nice area and wonderful view of Empire State and Chrysler building. Our room was directly across from elevator heard "ding" all night long.  Rooms have thin walls and we could hear people talking| laughing and music until the wee hours.  Bed was so so,Jan 16| 2019,3

Excellent and easy to use. We are very happy with our travels and hotel. Thank you a lot,Jan 6| 2019,5
Great hotel right outside of the business of Times Square but surrounded by great food & shopping.,Jan 5| 2019,5
We were told on the website check in was at 3 pm. When we arrived we were told check in was at 4 pm. Our room was not ready until4pm. Thank you,Jan 4| 2019,5
First time in New York| on arrival the reception staff and luggage people were very rude.  No information available in lobby about things to do. No information in room.  It seemed very unorganized and nobody seemed to be enjoying working there. First impressions count . They need to work on their customer service in all areas of the hotel .,Jan 4| 2019,2
The location is good and the views are impressive. It has a gym| but the elevator access to this is a little bit problematic as only 2 elevators go to the gym| but there is no way to specially call those elevators| and this could cause delays.  That issue could be solved.  The condition of the gym itself was OK| but some equipment was out of service (who knows for how long) and other prices quite old| but better than nothing!  Also had great views.,Jan 3| 2019,4
Fine hotel. Clean and comfortable. Close to Grand Central.,Jan 2| 2019,4
The concierge couldn’t have been more pleasant| or more helpful. Everything about our stay went smooth as silk. Wait. To use the WiFi| you had to be (or become) a rewards member. Fine—it didn’t cost anything to sign up| although we’re not likely to ever reap any rewards...,Jan 2| 2019,5
The check in process was painful!!  They never staffed more than two people even though it was holiday season in NYC.  The location of the hotel is nothing to get excited about unless you had business at the UN.  The accessible room I reserved was not accessible. That meant another 45 min of messing around to get settled.  The 3 nights I reserved via Hotels.com was sent to the hotel as one 2 night reservation and 1 single night reservation.  That meant our room cards did not work after two days.  More waiting in line at reception to get new cards.  Overall| an adequate property. Nothing special. No exceptional service|  It isn't cheap.  Look elsewhere .,Jan 1| 2019,2
Nice hotel a few blocks from grand central station| great location away from the crowds.,Jan 1| 2019,4
The service was awesome and the rooms were very clean. Room service great.,Dec 31| 2018,5
The hotel felt a bit dated to me| but it was very clean| and every member of the staff we encountered could not have been more friendly and accommodating.  The beds though... I’m not sure why| but these doubles seemed quite a bit smaller than any doubles I’ve ever encountered.  I was traveling with my 2 teenage daughters and we had to push the beds together and stick someone in the crack for all us us to fit comfortably and we’re small to average sized people. The location is good if you prefer a quiet neighborhood blocks away from the hustle and bustle| and I’m sure with the right room location there are some amazing views.  Ours| however| lacked anything spectacular.  Room service ends at 11| just FYI| which is normally not a big deal| but I was surprised being that this is New York| the city that never sleeps.  All in all| we enjoyed our stay| but being that this city has a million hotels to choose from| I don’t know that I’d choose to book here again| but I wouldn’t be upset if it’s where I ended up.,Dec 30| 2018,4
Got an awesome surprise upgrade at arrival. Everything went well.,Dec 30| 2018,5
Amazing !! Staff were so sweet to us. Especially for my best friend Birthday!! Ask front desk if they could do something special for birthday celebration !,Dec 30| 2018,5
The coffeemaker is confusing| otherwise the hotel is very nice. It's a bit away from the theater district| but close enough to walk.,Dec 30| 2018,4
Nice hotel with great service| specially breakfast staff,Dec 29| 2018,4
No free internet inside the roomsI was pay 150$ taxt fee more,Dec 29| 2018,4
amazing and cozy beautiful hotel,Dec 28| 2018,5
Overall the property was nice. However the hotel kitchen host       was quite rude.,Dec 27| 2018,4
Was awesome,Dec 26| 2018,5
We stayed for three nights and it was a great stay! Hotel staff was great| the room was very spacious| the bed was very comfortable and the view was great also.There were a couple of minor issues in the room that were immediately addressed.We had breakfast in hotel and enjoyed that also! I would definitely stay here again!,Dec 26| 2018,4
Nice hotel. The staff was friendly. We had a great view of New York,Dec 25| 2018,5
Good hotel close to best part of NY| Empire State| Chrysler Building| 5th Avenue etc.,Dec 25| 2018,4
Staff were absolutely helpful and the location made it easier to access other parts of the city that isn't the usual Times Square. Great choice especially during Christmas time.,Dec 25| 2018,5
Good  service  and nice amenities I like this hotel | i will come back  in the  future,Dec 25| 2018,4
Loved the hotel’s location| the room in particular with great window view. The staff was helpful and friendly. Staying here next time I’m in New York!,Dec 25| 2018,5
Staff is extremely friendly and professional,Dec 24| 2018,5
On arrival the bell hop and valet were fantastic. That is where everything took a turn for the worse. We had two rooms| both were in terrible condition. Water leaking from the ceiling| what looked like red paint splashed all over one of the bathrooms| one of the rooms had bad outlets and a non-functioning alarm clock. The coffee machine in one of our rooms had a missing cover for the water and the top of the refrigerator was so badly warped you couldn’t set anything on top of it| including the coffee machine and cups. The maid service was terrible too. We had left food trays from room service outside the door and it just sat there for three days| no one ever bothered to pick it up. We spoke to the front desk three times about the issues and the only thing they fixed (on second day) was the bad outlet.,Dec 24| 2018,2
Room was clean| bright; bed was very comfortable. State-of-the-art toilet/bidet was quite a conversation piece| lol. There was a Keurig-type espresso maker| although we’d have much preferred regular coffee in the morning. Husband ran around the corner to a Subway for some. A small fridge would have kept beer and wine cold. Excellent restaurants nearby (Angelleto| good Italian; Zaika| good northern Indian).,Dec 22| 2018,4
The hotel was very clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful,Dec 22| 2018,5
This was my 1st time in New York and my stay at your hotel was AMAZING!!,Dec 20| 2018,5
Everything was perfect! Friendly staff! The location of the hotel is only a 20mn wall to time square. It’s located on a not so busy side of manhattan and the view off my window (room 3708) was great! Definitely coming back!,Dec 20| 2018,5
Great location| staff and room! They do good the extra mile for all their guests. Will be back!,Dec 18| 2018,5
This is a quiet hotel with the rooms being so high up. Clean and modern| a bit pricey but it’s Nyc. Nice views mostly too.,Dec 17| 2018,3
They gave us a wrong room which was the only reason we booked here was for the room we were supposed to get| wasn’t even very clean. The coffee machine in our room was super dusty looked unused or cleaned in years.,Dec 17| 2018,1
Nice hotel and very friendly staff. Great location in downtown area.,Dec 17| 2018,4
The hotel was very clean and comfortable. Beautiful view from my window and the location is just perfect. I would definitely stay in this hotel again and will recommend it to my friends.,Dec 15| 2018,5
I liked the location close to train. Staff friendly and rooms spacious,Dec 15| 2018,5
Really nice and had nice views. Staff are friendly. Not much around the area though. Maybe it’s different in a weekday with the UN. But would stay here again.,Dec 14| 2018,5
nice hotel| great views and location. Slow elevators and a lounge in another tower that took at least 10 minutes to get to each day,Dec 13| 2018,3
Very very nice and very good  5  star Very close anywhere very quiet neighborhood And before they very nice,Dec 11| 2018,5
Most amazing room| spacious| clean and a priceless view....,Dec 11| 2018,5
Great hotel. Loved the room - big! Great closet and bathroom size. Can’t beat the price for NYC.,Dec 11| 2018,5
Hotel staff very friendly and accommodating. Room nice and clean. Close to train station Grand Central in walking distance.,Dec 11| 2018,5
Room was really spacious; more than most NYC hotels that I have stayed in. Quiet neighborhood. Front desk was really crowded probably due to holiday season.,Dec 10| 2018,4
I was a bit disappointed in this hotel.  I knew it would be off the beaten track so I lived with that.  But there was no morning breakfast room service (what????) though no one said anything to us at check in.  Also| they never replenished anything.  So| by the time we checked out (we stayed 3 days)| we were completely out of lotion| barely had any shampoo and conditioner| and| worst of all| had no wash cloths for our final shower.  The view was lovely and people were nice but| at the room rate for NY hotels and given that this hotel is in the Hilton family| I was pretty surprised at that.,Dec 10| 2018,3
WE ARRIVED 9 PM| AND OUR ROOM WAS NOT READY. WE HAD TO WAIT 20 MIN BUT THE FRONT DESK GAVE US COMPLIMENTARY BREAKFAST.  VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THAT,Dec 10| 2018,5
The property itself seemed to have been recently updated. Layout of bathroom and main room was well thought out| also spacious (for a New York City hotel). Service was cheerful and efficient| dealing with my issues (forgotten toothbrushes| trouble controlling lighting in the room) with promptness and a smile. The friendly doorman hailed a cab for us the following morning. Location is perhaps a bit remote (for Manhattan) but this is made up for in a less hectic somewhat quieter vibe.,Dec 10| 2018,5
It was a short| but nice stay. Hotel was very nice. Slow check in| but nice people on staff,Dec 10| 2018,5
Very happy with our stay.  All of the staff were courteous and helpful,Dec 10| 2018,4
Lovely staff. Clean hotel. Huge rooms for NYC hotel.,Dec 10| 2018,5
A seasoned New York traveler. This was my first visit to the East side of downtown. I will be back. So calm. Easy walks and the hotel and surroundings were perfect. Don’t hesitate. This Hilton hotel and its location is perfect.,Dec 10| 2018,5
The service desk was not manned.  It took more than 5 mins for anyone to answer the guest service phone.  The shower was broken and was never fixed despite asking several times.  The breakfast was over charged but they did correct it when I pointed it out.  Would not return to this hotel or recommend to others,Dec 10| 2018,2
Great place to stay- clean and spaceAll staffa are polite and intentive,Dec 10| 2018,5
Beautiful hotel! Amazing view. The room was very clean. Only gripe it is was difficult to find! There isn’t much by way of the name of the hotel in a place you can see it. We basically just followed others with suitcases. I’d stay here again for sure though.,Dec 9| 2018,4
Very nice experience. I wish I could set the air beyond 23 degrees though.,Dec 9| 2018,5
Upon check in the clerk sent us to the wrong wing of hotel and on a goose chase up a tall tower many stories up  in scary elevator looking for room. Back to the lobby we went. Bell desk helped point us in right direction after. Got all the way up to room (another hike in scary elevator) and arrived to a very run down| lack luster room. Not meeting that Hilton standard. Called front desk. Phone just rand & rang & rang & rang & rang. Transferred twice. Finally was put in touch w/ manager Arika. She corrected everything and went above & beyond with excellent customer service. I give her all credit for turning sour experience around!! She put us in a new room and had bellman help w/moving rooms. Offered free breakfast for our 3 night stay. New room had spectacular views & very spacious & clean room. Totally updated from the other. A million times better!!Thank you| Arika! And the two lovely bellman who have been w/the property 40+years. They were a delight. Breakfast had nice spread but didn't taste the best. Location isn't near anything-- two thumbs down for proximity to sights unless you are there to see UN.,Dec 8| 2018,4
Staff is superb. The bellmen are outstanding| Ainsley| Edward; all of them. Avery is awesome at the front desk.,Dec 8| 2018,5
Amazing accommodations they treated us like the duke and duchess of York 💕,Dec 6| 2018,5
Stay was great. Staff was friendly| helpful| and accommodating. The view from our room was very nice. Room itself was clean.,Dec 4| 2018,5
Beyond our expectations. .  View was amazing and staff were all very pleasant |would certain stay there again.b,Dec 4| 2018,5
Great inviting|cordial| professional staff.stayed here last month and experience was so wonderful I chose to come back!,Dec 4| 2018,5
We booked a room for 3 adults but the room was only set up for two. There was no water or milk for coffees. My friend had to sleep on the floor because a third bed was not supplied despite us checking  at the front desk and explaining the room was not big enough for three people. In fact the receptionist put the phone down on us which was very rude!!!  Overall a rubbish experience for our one night in New York despite the hefty £338 price tag for the night. Would never recommend this hotel and I would like to point out that they blamed Expedia for the mess up!,Dec 3| 2018,1
Place was VERY CLEAN!  Heat was poor in room and cleaning people shut it off during the day so we came back to a 65 degree room.  No refrigerator| espresso machine not coffee and no microwave| no drawers for clothes.   Beds were double not queen so a little crowded but comfy.  View was stupendous!!  Also WiFi was an additional $10 a day.  Ridiculous after paying almost $900 for 2 nights.,Dec 3| 2018,3
Amazing view and room,Dec 3| 2018,5
Excellent all around! First class experience in every way!,Dec 1| 2018,5
Absolutely loved the hotel! Will definitely be returning to the hotel!! Very clean and quiet! In a decent area but extremely close to everything! Grand central is about a 7 min walk away!,Nov 30| 2018,5
We booked a room for 4 only to find one king bed and a chair that was being passed off as a sofa bed. This was supposed to be an upgrade. We had to move rooms at 9pm and meant we could not go for dinner outside of the hotel as we had planned. The in house restaurant turned out to be good| they had great food,Nov 29| 2018,3
The hotel fulfilled a special request and had a yoga mat waiting in the room. Their attention to detail is amazing.,Nov 26| 2018,5
The breakfast was explained to be a buffet and it was a Continental breakfast at most.. Nothing with eggs were available.. Nothing warm on the buffet.. Unless you count coffee.. Very disappointed,Nov 25| 2018,2
There were some annoyances| but overall we enjoyed our stay and would return.  Annoyances: The front desk did not answer the phone when I tried to call ahead twice between flights to warn of our very late arrival. There were some overlooked maintenance issues: the mini fridge did not work| the fancy toilet control had dead batteries. But on the positive side| our room was there when we arrived; Maintenance responded nearly instantly and replaced the fridge; the room was quiet| comfortable and clean; the room had windows that OPENED (a rare thing in high-rise hotels!) so we could enjoy fresh air; and housekeeping was extremely attentive (made rounds in the morning to refresh the (Illy!) coffee supplies| always available for clean towels| etc). The view of the city from our room on the 30th floor was stunning. The hotel has extra security measures due to its location across the street from the UN: these include a circle of bollards outside the front door| and card-key activated elevators-- and the world's most adorable luggage-sniffing pooches! We looked forward to encountering them each time we went through the lobby.  The café in the lobby serves excellent Illy coffee drinks and breakfast pastries/snack items| and the staff were delightful. The location is a very short walk to Grand Central Station| and the neighborhood features many restaurants| from budget to high-priced| as well as a colorful Irish bar (open until 4 AM) with a genuine Irish bartender.,Nov 25| 2018,5
Everything was very clean and location was perfect. Parking was a little tough but staff helped with all needs and transportation,Nov 23| 2018,4
I was here for a weekend trip. Even though it was mid-afternoon and still light out| I had a little bit of trouble finding the entrance. I actually walked around the block once before finding it. The restaurant marquee is more prominently featured than the hotel marquee| which is on the wall next to the revolving door entrance. The reception desk is in an L-shape and there's no clear way to form a line. You have to find the last person and trust everyone to follow the order.The staff and check in and check out were both lovely and helpful in answering my questions. The elevator is down the corridor and on the left. The elevator didn't take too long to come and was efficient...and I was on the top floor!The room was spacious and mostly clean. The 38th floor has a great view of the city. Hilton has Crabtree & Evelyn products and I was glad that the set included soap| body wash| shampoo and conditioner. I wasn't sure of check out time but I'm pretty sure it wasn't 10am when someone knocked on my door. I didn't answer it so I didn't know what they wanted but that was weird.Coming back late at night wasn't a problem| but the streets around the hotel were pretty empty| even though it was Saturday night.I had a pleasant stay at this hotel and would come back.,Nov 20| 2018,4
The Millennium Hilton at One UN Plaza puts NYC at your doorstep. Great for walkers and only a short hop to Grand Central Terminal. The views are a bonus. Comfortable rooms. Excellent service.,Nov 18| 2018,4
Great location. The view of the city is fantastic. Hotel was overbooked but the manager did his best to make up for the error and we enjoyed our stay. Will go again definitely,Nov 18| 2018,5
The hotel was fine.  However| the address is misleading and we missed an appointment while we were circling by the car around the hotel trying to find the entrance.,Nov 16| 2018,5
Carpet was wet| Coffee Maker didn't work and Shower was not hot.,Nov 16| 2018,2
The staff needs to be more polite | and the room we stayed the ac  unite was making to much noise.,Nov 14| 2018,1
Very nice hotel| clean with professional staff. Very good location.  And spectacular view.,Nov 14| 2018,5
Have stayed here many times. Quiet (starts at floor 28) with very friendly staff. Room comfortable and spacious but a centre light in the bedroom would have helped| the coffee machine was a nightmare and there was no plug in the basin.,Nov 13| 2018,4
Our stay was amazing! They upgraded our room and gave us a view of the East River. The staff was friendly and welcoming. The room was clean and well stocked with essentials. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to stay at a nice hotel without breaking the bank.,Nov 13| 2018,5
Great staff and great location. We’d stay again.,Nov 12| 2018,5
Excellent hotel - my girlfriend and I enjoyed a 34th floor king room with great north-facing views. Rooms were immaculate| quiet and spacious and hotel is a short walk to all the mid-town attractions. Staff was extremely friendly and attentive. I would absolutely stay here again!,Nov 12| 2018,5
Nice hotel and nice view| the staff very good I recommended,Nov 11| 2018,5
GReat hotel lots of friendly people awesome staff awesome toilets cool amenities close to town,Nov 10| 2018,4
I had pleasant stay,Nov 9| 2018,5
We had a lovely room with a city view| which included a water view.  With the exception of one sort of surly person| the staff was very helpful.  The room was huge by NYC standards.  The bed was comfy and the window actually opened a little.  You need to be a member of Hilton Honors to get free wifi| but you can sign up on the spot.,Nov 6| 2018,5
This hotel is in a great area. Our room had beautiful views of Roosevelt Island & the East River. The fitness center has amazing views also. It’s a perfect location to many great places but away from the noise and traffic. The service was great and we have already recommended this hotel to several friends.,Nov 6| 2018,5
Clean| modern| view of the city| coffee machine| big tv| big clean bathroom| all amenities,Nov 6| 2018,5
Hotel toilet too low - This needs updating- at least clean windows or brighten up drapery.  The clean up crew kept bothering me the day of checkout from 8:50am - 10:00am ( twice) knocking on the door to see if I was still there.  Very dingy|drab looking room. The TV a bit large for me| although overall space in room was adequate.,Nov 6| 2018,3
excellent location for my purposes; good view of city,Nov 5| 2018,4
Stayed for the NYC marathon. Everyone at the hotel was amazing !,Nov 5| 2018,5

|great location| nice room front desk staff ok| could have been more helpful. no concierge at 9 pm,Nov 2| 2018,5
Differences in rooms. The tower is much better than the other sector.,Oct 30| 2018,3
Very clean and comfortable,Oct 29| 2018,4
Beautiful hotel with extraordinary staff - Robert (bell service) and Jeffrey (bar/restaurant) were exceptional in service and went out of their way to care! This hotel is one of my all time favorites with the most beautiful views of Manhattan from your room.,Oct 29| 2018,5
Close to areas we wanted to see (Theatre District| UN| GCS (& subway),Oct 29| 2018,5
Because of its proximity to Grand Central Station| the UN| and cafes| restaurants| etc. the Millenium Hilton’s One UN Plaza location is lovely.  The hotel is clean and comfortable| secure (guard with a dog at the entrance) and| the views are spectacular.  All in all| a nice hotel at an affordable price,Oct 29| 2018,4
Great place with excellent location| very friendly staff.,Oct 28| 2018,5
We've stayed at this hotel numerous times| always a beautiful view.  Whether of the Chrysler building| the East River or downtown.,Oct 26| 2018,5
We enjoyed our stay at this hotel it’s very nice and located in a convenient area near the sights.,Oct 23| 2018,4
We waited hours for extra Blanket| bathroom had mold wasn’t clean and the shower had a clog with hair and that was disgusting. Stuff at the door was very nice and friendly só was the desk stuff| I tried to get a bottle water it was $10 bottle water plus $5 delivery charge I was like OMG that is unbelievable| so I wouldn’t stay there again.,Oct 22| 2018,3
Check-in was not a good experience!  Spoke to a manager. Listened to my complaint and that was it.,Oct 22| 2018,4
It is not Hilton standard. The carpet had Stains| shower door was not closing properly hence water kept leaking out the door| beds and pillows were not comfortable.,Oct 22| 2018,1
THE HOTEL IS AT A GREAT LOCATION| THE ROOM WAS CLEAN| MODERN AND WAS A GOOD SIZE.  THE CHECK IN WAS NICE AND EASY.  MY HUSBAND AND I WERE SO HAPPY WITH OUR STAY UNTIL WE DECIDED TO HAVE BREAKFAST AT THEIR RESTAURANT.  THERE WAS NO INDICATION ANYWHERE ABOUT THE PRICES.  WE WENT AND HAD LITERALLY JUST EGGS AND FRUIT AND WE WERE SLAPPED WITH AN ALMOST $90 BILL TO OUR ROOM.  WE WERE IN ABSOLUTE SHOCK!!!  WHEN WE WENT TO SPEAK TO THE FRONT DESK ABOUT IT| THE WOMAN THERE WAS SO RUDE AND JUST TOLD US THAT IT WAS THE PRICE AND THAT'S ALL.  SHE DIDN'T OFFER ANY KIND OF HELP WHATSOEVER! $90 FOR A BREAKFAST IS JUST A PLAIN RIP OFF NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE IN THE WORLD.  IT IS A RIDICULOUS PRICE!!!  WHATEVER YOU DO| DO NOT EAT AT THEIR RESTAURANT!!!!!!,Oct 21| 2018,4
Great staff location and most rooms have an amazing view,Oct 20| 2018,5
the hotel was very comfortable it felt like home I would definitely recommend this hotel to anybody who is traveling to New York City I like the staff and the location was perfect,Oct 19| 2018,5
Amazing views and timely staff! I would highly recommend!,Oct 18| 2018,5
The property was very nice and in a great location. One of the bad aspects of our stay were the beds. We requested a double-bed room| but the size of the two beds were equivalent to a twin bed. That was the only downfall of our stay. Other than that the bellhop was amazing and the hotel was very clean.,Oct 17| 2018,4
Tower left on the floor got put back to the tower rail,Oct 17| 2018,3
Door bell gentlemen were friendly and super helpful.  they went above and beyond and made the overall experience great.Just with the pillows were more comfy.,Oct 16| 2018,5
Needed a quick place to stay and it was beyond my expectations. Thanks again,Oct 15| 2018,5
Attempt to check in early understandably denied but not without an unsolicited offer to upgrade with a fee. Poor communication and attentiveness to consumer concerns.,Oct 14| 2018,1
Very clean| comfortable beds. No room service in the morning which is hard to believe a property like this doesn’t have.,Oct 14| 2018,3
The room smelled of smoke.,Oct 11| 2018,2
This is a modern| comfortable| hospitable hotel.  When we want a midtown hotel in Manhattan| it's a preference for us.,Oct 10| 2018,5
Nice view| friendly staff. Location was good because it’s in a less high-traffic area,Oct 9| 2018,4
Good location| nice room| view of the river and Chrysler Building and Empire State Building.  Only issue was getting our towels changed| or provided towels at all.  Checked in and room had no towels; next day no washcloths or shampoo.  Found housekeeping staff who told us linen supply was a general problem.  Not a big deal,Oct 9| 2018,5
Service at the concierge was pretty average. Not many smiles and no interest in welcoming and assisting guests - except for one porter working inside the hotel and the other outside. They were excellent esp the African American porter inside the hotel who was always willing to help. Hotel concierge forgot to explain to us the wifi and did not give us any info on access. Given that we booked three rooms at a high rate| we should expect a bottle of water to be complimentary but didn’t receive any upon checking in.,Oct 9| 2018,3
Overall the hotel was ok as the views were stunning and the room was very beautiful.The 2 points I disliked about my stay are below: 1. There was no minibar or mineral water provided in the rooms due to a new law in New York which meant hotels were now unable to provide minibars or water - this is standard procedure in all hotels according to the hotel manager who has worked in 4 different hotels! You can only imagine how unhelpful this information was while being extremely thirsty at 5am and having no access to water until 7am. The manager did eventually send up two complimenatry  bottles of water at 5.30am.  2. I was charged $50 deposit per night so $100 deposit in total "just incase I used something from minibar" according to the receptionist?! Honestly| I have no issue paying the deposit they could have made it $200 a night but the least they could have provided was water in the minibar at a charge of course which would be deducted from the deposit! I was literally refunded the $100 upon check out which was a waste of time as they could have simply held credit card details incase we used the empty minibar!,Oct 8| 2018,3
Beautiful view| pleasant and helpful staff| clean rooms. Only complaint is the pool is out of service...for a year.,Oct 8| 2018,5
big room with a great view and close to midtown without being in the crowds. plenty of nearby dining options and 20 min walk from grand central and subway,Oct 8| 2018,5
Good location| welcoming and professional staff| good facilities| rooms are spacious and clean| great views| comfortable bed| nice illy coffee maker with illy! coffee in the room!,Oct 1| 2018,5
Very nice hotel| I will come back againThe hotel is super clean| I take a corner room in 34 floor the wiew was amazing,Sep 29| 2018,4
This hotel is clearly meant for business travellers| being in the same builing as UN offices and accross the street from the UN headquarters. That does not mean you should be put off if you are planning a leisure trip to New York City.What this hotel does not provide is proximity to places such as downtown and Times Square so that is what may put off some tourists| but I would count that as a plus. You are still on Manhattan and its not as if any of these things are a amillion miles away. For that small sacrifice you get a well appointed quiet hotel in a nice naighbourhood.The hotel is about 3 blocks away from Grand central Terminal so that can provide you with access to the Subway and local Railroads that can get you to anywhere in the NYC Metro area within the hour| New York has an amazing public transport system by US standards.As you would expect from a hotel built to cater for the needs of the UN the staff are very accomodating  and happy to help| I didnt use the bar / restaurant on this occasion| but I have used it in the past and found in very nice altough a little pricey for the neighbourhood.Close to the hotel in Midtown / Upper West Side there are many bars| restaurants and shops that are reasonably priced| located around 2nd and 3rd avenues between 40th and 50th Streets that will cater for your needs without being overly busy.The area around the hotel is very safe. But I have been to NYC 3 times and at least on Manhattan found the city to be veruy safe.,Sep 23| 2018,5
No minibar| no snacks on site at night| restaurant closed during the day| poor service - waited 5 - 10 minutes every time I needed anything from the front desk. No Honors check in special service...Very surprised how bad the service was.,Sep 22| 2018,2
A 10min wall to Grand Central located next to the UN but otherwise surrounded mainly by embassies and consulates so quiet. Stayed on the 38th floor with great views over the city. Restaurant and cafe in the hotel were pricey and so many better options available,Sep 19| 2018,4
At reception staff don’t welcome you and they talk like you are taking their space for free| I didn’t like it at all. Such a nice hotel good location but not many well trained staffs ...,Sep 17| 2018,3
I was so surprised when I get there. Nobody helped me with my luggage .,Sep 17| 2018,3

The hotel was absolutely amazing. The view of the Hudson and the city was incredible. The staff was so helpful and Friendly! The sheets were so soft and comfy| and the bathroom was sparklingly clean!,Sep 9| 2018,5

Beautiful coean hotel with friendly helpful staff. Gret location|convenient to shopping and restaurants,Sep 4| 2018,5
What a joke lol| lived at hiltons all across the world. By far the worse hotel possible. 1 hour late for checkout at noon| charges $50 late checkout fee. Don’t all hotels usually check out at 12? If not why not call and remind? Room that was “newly renovated” looked old and torn| asked for a room change to the older west tower that my friend was staying at but they couldn’t “gaurantee” a room even though I booked the hotel for four days. They told me to go down each morning to check for availability.,Sep 4| 2018,1
Very near to everything like subway| shops but the staff were so rude and unfriendly,Sep 4| 2018,4
I did not like that my reservation was given away and I did not even get to check in. After event I came to check in and was told due to high occupancy my room was unavailabe and I wouldn’t be able to check in but other accommodations were made at another hotel. The other hotel did not offer room service or similar accommodations in my opinion at least plus it was 1am and I had just finished partying all night long so they said we could cancel at no charge. I told the manager we had decided to nacelle and her response was “that’s great news!” Yea great for you because you got out of doing your job but was it great for the customer who reserved a room to crash at after an event who is now stranded in NY and has to find a train back to Long Island at a time when all train lines are not in service. Beware when booking through this property and this site since they don’t actually “reserve” a room for you!!!,Sep 3| 2018,1
It was very grt stay over there. We check in around 930 pm and check in was smooth. Staffs are friendly. The WiFi was not connected to my mob. We called front desk| she tried to help but still not connected. The location is not so great . The only complaint is that there was no breakfast for us. Usually a 4 star hotel should provide breakfast for the guest.,Sep 2| 2018,4
Super location| very comfortable and helpful staff.,Sep 1| 2018,5
location is a super plus if one needs to work at UN building. great views on the river.,Sep 1| 2018,4
Hotel is under construction which is fine...understandable. But their computer system was out. I had to wait around for 5 hours to check-in. They gave me a "suite" because of having to wait around but the room was so awkward and uncomfortable I would have rather had a regular room. Elevators are so old and clunky; they take forever. They still charge for internet...who does that in 2018? The trash wasn't emptied in my room when it was cleaned.,Aug 31| 2018,1
The front desk waiting area not too comfortable. And the service kind slow.,Aug 31| 2018,4
Excellent location| awesome bellman and the pillows are heaven...,Aug 29| 2018,5

Have always loved this property and it's location. It's like living in the neighborhood without being surrounded by commercial/retail properties. The un plaza is a stunning backdrop for walking on 1st Ave.,Aug 21| 2018,5
I had a wonderful view but was misinformed by Expedia that there was a pool which rueined my stay !!!!! It was the main reason I booked the hotel !,Aug 21| 2018,1
Beautiful hotel in a great location close to all.  Amazing views of the water and the UN. Plus if you are Hilton Diamond you could get an amazing upgrade. The staff were great very helpful and very nice to deal with. Room was amazing (upgraded) clean| incredible views and lots of space.,Aug 20| 2018,5
Valet parking is $79 and the food is extremely expensive.  Nothing special or exclusive about the hotel.,Aug 20| 2018,4
No hotel bar available to have pre bed cocktail,Aug 18| 2018,4
Fantastic views of the city and all nearby easy to get to .,Aug 18| 2018,5
Roaches in the room and in the bathroom.,Aug 17| 2018,5
公共の乗り物は使用せず、ハイヤーでしたが便利な場所でした。静かです。ファミリーは少ないと思います。マンハッタンのミッドタウンではなく、初めての場所で国連の前で比較的安全だと思うし、ビューも川沿いだし、良かったです。エレベーターが古過ぎるのか音が凄くてアトラクションに乗っている気分で怖かったです。。,Jul 5| 2021,4
Disappointed by the lack of services: was not advised about needing to ask for the cleaning of the room! No gym.  Prices at the café are very expensive. The staff very friendly though (thank you all),Jun 15| 2021,4

Die Aussicht ist nach wie vor sehr sehenswert! Auch die Gegend ist ruhig und sehr angenehm.Allerdings war ich dieses Mal von allem anderen sehr enttäuscht.Die Sauberkeit war| und das in Covid 19 Zeiten| sehr bedenklich (schwarze Haare am Badezimmerboden| WC und Badewanne nicht wirklich hygienisch sauber| Kaffeemaschine nicht ordentlich gereinigt| Fenster total verdreckt - man sah sämtliche Nasen und Stirnabdrücke auf den Scheiben)| das Personal war gelangweilt| unmotiviert und unfreundlich| das Internet funktionierte ab Tag vier überhaupt nicht mehr. Beim Check out war der Schalter nicht besetzt| und auch die Gepäckaufbewahrung wurde aufgrund von Covid 19 einfach abgeschafft.Für mich war das der letzte Aufenthalt im Millennium Hilton und ich könnte es| abgesehen von der Aussicht und Gegend| auch nicht mehr weiterempfehlen.,Feb 8| 2021,3

Très bon hôtel| vue magnifique sur East river & Long island city. Personnel accueillant| serviable & compétent. Chambre confortable. Petit déjeuner bien| mais pas exceptionnel (pour 43 dollars)| je conseille plutôt les nombreux cafés & diners du quartier. Je n'ai pas essayé le fitness center| mais j'ai eu de bon écho.

L'hôtel n'a plus de piscine| pas prévenus. Le petit déjeuner est servi en sous sol et non avec une vue splendide comme annoncée. Si nous avions su qu'il n'y avait pas toutes ces commodités nous n'aurions pas choisi cet hôtel! Très déçus! Surtout lorsque l'on regarde le prix et ce qui est annoncé!,Oct 31| 2019,2

I stayed one week and found it well-located in midtown. Silent Location. Rooms are bigger than in many other Hotels in Manhattan. Nice bar for a last drink. I did not use the restaurant| therefore I can't rate it. A nice coffee shop at the Lobby with very friendly staff. Room was very clean| staff absolutely friendly and helpful. Appro. 8-10 minutes walk to Central Station trains/subway. WiFi does work perfectly. I had a room on floor 32 and the view was spectacular (you should ask for a room in the upper floors if available).,Oct 23| 2019,5

Das Hotel hat uns im allgemeinen gefallen. Es ist sehr zentral und die Sehenswürdigkeiten sind gut zu erreichen. Die Standardzimmer sind etwas klein allerdings hatten wir eine tolle Aussicht. Im Hotelzimmer konnte man sich gut zurückziehen und hatte Ruhe (keinerlei Lärm).Mit dem Personal hat man kaum was zutun hier geht es nur um sachliches wie zum Beispiel Check in und Check out. Ansonsten war es sehr sauber allerdings hätten wir für den Preis etwas mehr von allem erwartet.,May 10| 2019,4

the security was good (maybe nearby UN PLAZA) and the location not bad. It's nearby the grand central station so pretty easy to access to most of tourist sites .However the room little bit small than our expectation,Apr 29| 2019,4
ニューヨークにおいて静かで落ち着きがあるロケーションと思います。交通も地下鉄、バスが便利でを乗り放題のメトロカードをの利用すると便利で不自由しません。UNの目の前のホテルです。ホテル周辺は警官が要所要所にいて夜の外出も気になりません。部屋からの景色が素晴らしく，また良くメンテされて快適でした。チェックイン・アウトも丁寧で気持ちよく滞在できました。お薦めのホテルと思います。ただ繁華街でにぎやかなところが好みの方はタイムズスクエア地区がいいかもしれませんね。,Apr 21| 2019,5
Jeg liker de store og komfortable rommene med utsikt på dette hotellet. Jeg liker ikke air-con| men her er det ok| ikke for bråkete. Vinduet kan såvidt åpnes. Ganske rolig og lite støy på rommet. Ute er det mye støy| det er jo på Manhattan. Savner litt bedre arbeidslys ved skrivebordet. (Amerikanske hotellrom har ofte mørk innredning og dårlig belysning). Bra wifi| kjøleskap og illy kaffemaskin| god kaffe| men dårlig for te. Treningsrom. Frokost på hotellet er for dyrt og ikke verdt prisen| men det er mange kafeer og delis i strøket.,Apr 21| 2019,5

Perfekt beliggenhet for FN-besøk| romslig og velutstyrt rom| super utsikt. Dog skuffende at romservicematen kommer med et lass French fries og knallhvitt brød - akkurat som frokost (sjokkerende dyr!) kun har hvitt brød. Men nydelig eggerøre.. Men  - bruk hotellet| spis et annet sted.,Apr 18| 2019,4
Séjour d'une nuit. Hôtel très propre. Chambre spacieuse.,Apr 17| 2019,5
El área y el servicio. Lo único malo es que el restaurante del hotel cierra muy temprano.,Mar 11| 2019,5
Great view from the rooms| but the bathrooms wern’t as great as in the pictures. + Charging for WiFi is strange and outdated,Mar 5| 2019,4
well-known and well-managed hotel. location is good. staffs are kind and professional. the building itself is now quite old. though renovated| still little bit out of date. however| maybe because of this| the price is good.,Feb 13| 2019,4
No me gusto la parte del hotel donde nos asignaron la habitación| es muy antigua la decoración.  Las ventanas muy sucias.,Feb 12| 2019,4
gut. Nicht weit von Grand central. Zimmer ist sauber. Zimmer ist renoviert. Nur die Wartehalle ist noch nicht renoviert.,Feb 10| 2019,4
Hotel mit toller Lage| wir erreichten fast alle Sehenswürdigkeiten zu Fuß.Prinzipiell sehr schönes Hotel| nur vereinzelt etwas veraltete/abgenutzt,Feb 7| 2019,4
Dejligt nyrenoveret hotel med store vaerelser,Feb 5| 2019,5
Excellent accueil!,Jan 30| 2019,5
En general la experiencia muy buena| lamenté no haber tenido una hora para el checkout,Jan 27| 2019,4

Got robbed. I was a guest at the Millennium Hilton One Hotel at the UN Plaza in New York| since December 30| 18´ to January 06th| 19´.The 3rd of January 19 me and my girlfriend left the room around 1pm. Since we were planning to visit several attractions in New York| i quickly decided to leave my sunglasses in a blue bag inside my room. That same 3rd in the night| when we were back| i looked over inside the blue bag (where i had other things) and did not see the sunglasses. -That got my thought but we were tired and got sleep-. The next day| January 4th 19´| we started preparing for that day trip and then i went up to get my sunglasses from the blue bag. As long as i searched them| they were NOT there. Not there or in other bag or place in the room. There were surely lost (taken/stolen) from the room. I was upset| because i had a black bag with lock| and i clearly remember that 3rd that i was thinking "it was the best place to put the sunglasses in"| but again| i remember that i did think "nothing is going to happen here| this is a safe hotel and they are not plain sight". As upset and worried about the situation i got to the lobby and filed a claim. The gentleman in charge of security asked me to comment him everything that happened and to write it down| which i did. He got a picture from my cellphone where i can prove i wear them the 2nd January| 2019.Two weeks of emails between me and the Front Office Director| they did nothing| but a WE ARE SORRY.,Jan 14| 2019,2
Muy buena ubicación. Personal amable. Las habitaciones tienen una excelente vista a la ciudad. Recomendable,Jan 9| 2019,5
직원들의 무표정과 시설들의 고장(샤워부손잡이 탈락| 객실에서의 설비 소음)등으로 신경쓰이게 하는 요소들이 많음.,Jan 9| 2019,1
Einsehr schönes Hotel. Mit der Subway kann man jede Ecke schnell erreichein.,Jan 8| 2019,5
房间位置非常棒，能看到海景，以后还会入住,Jan 7| 2019,5
Tuvimos problemas con el check in| no encontraban nuestra reserva| nos hicieron llamar a hoteles.com (eran las 12 de la noche allí) finalmente tenia un correo con el numero de reserva de una consulta que hice y con ese numero encontraron la reserva. El personal no es nada amable. El ultimo día encontramos debajo de la cama unas zapatillas y un guante que no eran nuestros| por lo que debian llevar mas de 5 dias sin que nadie revisara ni limpiara. El ultimo dia el hombre de la puerta nos insistió mucho (hasta la pesadez) a coger un taxi en vez de un uber y como no lo hicimos no nos abrio ni la puerta. Las vistas y la habitacion del hotel estab bien| pero la limpieza y el personal es desastroso.,Jan 4| 2019,3
Muy buen hotel me encanto sobre todo la vista tan bella que se podia observar desde la habitación en el piso 35. El desayuno bien rico y con mucha variedad.Lo recomiendo.,Jan 2| 2019,5
Location eccezionale ed albergo molto buono. Avevo già soggiornato in questo albergo ad aprile. Mi sono trovato bene e sono tornato,Dec 29| 2018,5
Todo muy bueno la vista desde la habitación es bella en la noche,Dec 25| 2018,5
das Hotel war sehr zentral gelegen| gut zu erreichen,Dec 19| 2018,4
Great view over east river and manhattan. At Breakfast Amado was the best!,Dec 18| 2018,5
Goed hotel! Vriendelijk personeel. Bedden helaas te zacht waardoor ik in een geul lag en brak wakker werd. Keuze hotel was oa dat er op de foto’s geen badkamers met douchegordijnen te zien was| helaas gold dat niet voor ons alhoewel het bad breed genoeg was| en ik vrij stond van douchegordijn tijdens het douchen. Het uitzicht viel een klein beetje tegen| uitzicht op skyline was deels| naast een groot gebouw dat heel dichtbij stond. Denk de andere ‘tower’. Lokatie prima| niet in die drukte maar iets rustiger gelegen.. een aanrader,Dec 17| 2018,4
Dopo anni a Manhattan posso dire indiscutibilmente che il Millenium One UN Plaza è il miglior hotel in cui siamo stati. Camere grandi| dotazione curata| pulizie impeccabili| personale davvero gentile e disponibile... sicuramente saremo ancora vs. ospiti.,Dec 16| 2018,5
アーリーチェックインはrequestしましたがフロントからは16時からじゃないとできないと一点張りでした。。その後アプリ経由で申告し、部屋が空き次第連絡はいただきました。大きめの部屋をアレンジしてもらってるので満足です。場所は便利で周辺の移動もスムーズでした！イベントがあるかもしれませんが滞在料金は予想以上よりはるかに高かったです。,Dec 13| 2018,4
Chambre très confortable| vue superbe.Mais pas d’eau ni de mini bar|ce qui est étonnant pour un Hilton... 17$ la bouteille d’eau .... Très peu de produits dans la salle de bain.Plutôt bien placé|environ 20minutes à pieds de Time Square.,Dec 12| 2018,4
This hotel is well situated for walking distance to all the major sights in Manhattan| yet being located just off 2nd ave it's a quieter (noise wise) part of town. The only negative point was the beds in the double room that we reserved are smaller than the standard double bed in Europe so weren't suitable for our family of 4. However we were able to upgrade to a 1 bedroom suite which was fantastic!  The customer service was second to none.,Dec 11| 2018,5
very nice hotel| I had a good experience here!!!,Dec 10| 2018,5
Very professional staff. Emily arranged some small inconvénients the same day of my arrival. She is professional and  had a sens of hospitality and responsabilité. Thank you,Nov 18| 2018,4
In direkter Nähe der Einrichtungen der Vereinten Nationen in New York. Für New Yorker Verhältnisse ist die Gegend sonst (vor allem abends) aber eher ruhig. Grand Central ist in etwa 15 Minuten fußläufig zu erreichen. Beim Hotel gibt es nichts zu beanstanden| Service| Zimmer war alles in Ordnung. Trotz des hohen Preises (für New York auch nicht ungewöhnlich) sollte man aber auch nichts Außergewöhnliches erwarten. Für Geschäftsreisen in diesen Teil von Manhattan geeignet| für Tourist*innen aufgrund der Lage vermutlich nicht ganz so interessant.,Nov 14| 2018,4
조용하고 안전한곳편안하게 쉴 수 있어서 정말 좋았어요.,Nov 12| 2018,5
価格を除けば満足でした,Nov 12| 2018,4
Førnøyd med hotellet men før/ved innsjekk ble det rett og slett ubehagelig. Vi fikk hjelp med kofferten av en som jobbet på hotellet og jeg betalte for transporten vår. Vedkommende som hjalp til med koffertene bort til resepsjonen sto bak oss ved innsjekking og krevde tips og forstyrret innsjekkingingen| tilslutt måtte jeg avbryte innsjekking og forklare at jeg ikke hadde cash på meg men jeg kommer bort til deg når jeg har vært og fått tatt ut cash. Synes på et hotell som dette at man skal slippe å bli møtt av en slik dårlig service fra de ansatte. Jeg gir selvfølgelig alltid tips| men denne gangen hadde jeg ikke cash på meg og slik oppførsel fortjener heller ikke tips. Meget uheldig start på hotelloppholdet| men ellers var servicen bra fra de ansatte.,Nov 9| 2018,4
Het inchecken verliep vlekkeloos en we kregen een upgrade naar een suite met 2 slaapkamers| 2 badkamers| prachtig uitzicht op de Chrysler building en Empire state building. Prima locatie (15-20 min lopen naar Times Square).,Nov 7| 2018,5
Hôtel de grande qualité situé à deux pas des nations unis| qualité du personnel et de son sens du service rendu. Nous avions la chance d’avoir une chambre situé au 35eme étage sur 38 face sud-sud/ouest nous offrant une vue exceptionnelle sur tout Manhattan sud et ses nombreuses tout emblématiques (Empire State Building| tour One| Chrysler building...). Métro Grand Central à moins de 10 mn à pieds et de nombreux restaurants sympathiques sur la 2eme avenue toute proche.,Nov 4| 2018,5
基本的に不自由なく過ごせました。タクシーを利用する際は、ミレニアム ヒルトンホテルと伝えると、別の場所に到着してしまうので、UN plazaである事も一緒に伝えると間違いないでしょう。周辺はオフィス街といった雰囲気で、食事等も困りませんでした。,Nov 4| 2018,5
wir hatten ein Eckzimmer mit einer traumhaften Aussicht auf die Skyline von NY. Zimmer war sehr sauber und das Bett sehr bequem.Einzig negativer Aspekt: Es gibt WLAN nur in der Lobby! Wenn man diesen "Luxus" im Zimmer genießen möchte| muss man zahlen...,Oct 19| 2018,5
Bra hotell men ikke verdt prisen. Et vindu som ikke kunne lukkes helt gjorde atcdrt ble kaldt. Heller ikke gratis Wi-fi,Oct 17| 2018,4
Muy bien Gracias,Oct 14| 2018,4
Aufgrund diverser kleinerer Mängel| bekamen wir von Sylvia ( sehr sehr zuvorkommend) ein dickes Upgrade.Vielen Dank nochmal. Es ist etwas abgelegen aber dafür " etwas" ruhiger  und man muss ein paar Meter laufen um zur nächsten Subwayststion (Grand Central) zu kommen. Aber alles in allem: Super!Tip: versuchen Sie bei Buchungen ein Zimmer im Ostturm zu bekommen| der würde erst kürzlich renoviert,Oct 13| 2018,4
It was a decent price point. The service was ok. The area was excellent.,Aug 18| 2021,3
Amazing view of the One World Trade Center| memorial| and the bay,Aug 16| 2021,5
Dirty Dirty Dirty my room was soDirty that they had to change my room and that was dirty too. Glad the manager saw this. Will be requesting a full refund!!! Beautiful view and location but Filty,Aug 16| 2021,1
Amazing view. Staff was great and friendly,Aug 15| 2021,5
Well I booked a room with a bath separated from the shower but I got a connected bath and shower and the room wasn’t as I thought,Aug 15| 2021,2
Rooms need to be upgraded. Views beautiful,Aug 15| 2021,5
Great location.Property maintenance left some to be desired. Not all elevators working. Lobby closed.Refrigerators disconnected in roomsSome staff did not seem to be up to par with amenities.,Aug 14| 2021,4
I didn't like the staff. Specifically Claudine. Extremely rude and unprofessional. Will not be returning or recommending to anyone.,Aug 10| 2021,3
The carpet is full of stains. It’s outdated. The lobby had a bad smell.,Aug 10| 2021,2
Fridge and safe didn't work| otherwise very good stay,Aug 9| 2021,4
Overall| I'd rate this as a good hotel and would stay there again.  We did have a few issues| but it wasn't anything that were deal breakers.  It was advertised that parking was less than 1000 ft and when I spoke with the front desk verifying the parking situation| I was told yes| they have parking and it was $64 a night.  We got there| the parking deck beside the hotel was shut down and the gentleman working the front desk didn't know what the other associate was talking about.  We still found a deck a block and a half away after searching around.  Second issue| we booked a junior suite and when we went to check in were told they no longer had any suites available.  They wanted to comp us with two connecting room| but I explained it was a trip with my husband and a second room would just be wasteful.  They then instead gave us a high-rise room.  The views from the room were beautiful.  All in all| the rooms are a little dated| but even after the confusion with the parking and booking| we loved the location| loved the views and would book there again.,Aug 9| 2021,4
not clean at all| uncomfortable beds| bathroom dirty and dingy,Aug 9| 2021,1
The view is very beautiful,Aug 7| 2021,5
Fabulous views of downtown NYC!,Aug 6| 2021,5
There was a soap box that was stuck to the ceiling of my shower l| looks like it has been there for a while. I don’t know how that goes unnoticed when making sure a room is cleaned for a new guest to stay in. Makes me sick to my stomach knowing that if that was left on the ceiling what else isn’t clean in the room. I have taken a picture of the box that is somehow stuck to the ceiling of the shower and if you want a picture of it i am more than happy to send it to whoever reaches out to me. That was really gross and I would like to get a refund for my room. I think the least to expect when staying at a hotel is a clean room and my room was not clean. Especially in times like now with covid I would think hotels were being more cautious about how clean the rooms are to avoid spreading but I guess your hotel isn’t. Please refund me for the room.,Aug 5| 2021,1
I had stayed here in the past| and it was a great hotel.  It seems that the hotel is long overdue for a makeover.   Due to Covid-19 the bar| restaurant| room service were all closed.  The hotel rooms need an update.  Currently| they are worn out.  Stained couches| peeling paint| broken handles| etc.   I think it does have the best views in Manhattan| but the facilities were worn and outdated,Aug 2| 2021,3
It is in a great location with great views.  Housekeeping service was excellent.  I marked "amenities" only as pleasing because of some restrictions still due to Covid.  Lots of good restaurants in the area with many shopping opportunities.  We had a great visit.,Jul 31| 2021,5
Great location and view,Jul 31| 2021,5
No indoor pool. No restaurant. No bar . no parking . no mini bar . no breakfast.,Jul 27| 2021,5
Beautiful view| amazing service. Two dirty towels but otherThan that it was great.,Jul 27| 2021,5
The hotel is very clean and had a nice sized room. The best thing about our room was that it faced the freedom tower. It was an amazing view. The area has so much to do and was very convenient getting to other areas of the city with the train across the street.,Jul 25| 2021,5
The view from our room on the 43rd floor was spectacular!,Jul 25| 2021,5
Pleasant stay| Staff are friendly and helpful.We had a suite and the king bed was comfortable.Some updates need to be done with furniture.,Jul 19| 2021,4
The view in the corner room was stellar and the staff was accommodating. The overall condition and design of the rooms are outdated.,Jul 18| 2021,3
Looks nothing like the pictures. The room is so outdated. Limited amenities and you still pay regular price. Never again oh yeah and go fat I had mold in my bathroom smh,Jul 18| 2021,1
Dated| and bathroom didn’t seem clean. Had an odor. Carpet was dated. Just an old hotel that needs updates!,Jul 18| 2021,2
The view was amazing hands down! Location was the best. But the fridge wasn't working and no room service or bar area was off limits and the pool was closed down. Air could have been a bit better as well.  The location made up for it's lack of availability though,Jul 17| 2021,3
Is not what you see in the pictures,Jul 17| 2021,3
This hotel was amazing I have never been to New York and I’m so glad we picked a great location! Directly across from the World Trade Center memorial| east subway access and a safe and clean area. I will definitely be staying here again for my next visit thank you Millennium Hilton !,Jul 16| 2021,5
I expected more from The Millineum.They really need to invest in some upgrades.,Jul 13| 2021,4
Proximity to wtc,Jul 13| 2021,5
Good service overall.,Jul 13| 2021,5
Very powerful aura around and in this hotel! Beautiful property and very clean rooms,Jul 13| 2021,5
clean and comfortable place.,Jul 11| 2021,4
There was a roach in my room but they immediately gave me the option to switch my room and gave me a nicer view on the 40th floor. And the lady at the front desk was very nice about it and understanding. So I did appreciate that. I do wish the pool/spa or atleast the bar downstairs could be open. But I can understand given the covid restrictions. Overall it was a decent stay and the staff was polite.,Jul 7| 2021,4
Prefect location. Next to World Trade Center. Beautiful view from room. Pleasant and helpful staff.,Jul 7| 2021,5
Parking off site. No valet. No dining areas open yet in hotel. No little store with snacks available in hotel.room was nice. Had a great view of tower..room was clean. Toilet very very low so would be hard for elderly.,Jul 6| 2021,4
View was amazing| people were wonderful.  Our flight got in early| like six hours before check in| and they let us leave our bags there and explore the city.  We were even able to check in early.  I was a little surprised that there was no fridge.  A mini bar| I understand due to Covid| but clean out the fridge and plug it back in!  Our leftovers all had to go in the trash.  Hotel is dated and needs to be updated...BADLY!,Jul 6| 2021,5
view view view,Jul 6| 2021,5
There were no restrooms in the Hotel Lobby.  There was no microwave or fridge in the rooms.  It was an old hotel.,Jul 5| 2021,5
they not open the indoor swimming pool,Jul 5| 2021,1
City Views and convenience to walking to attractions and subway.,Jul 5| 2021,5
Disappointed! Because the name of the hotel is Hilton| I expected a lot. But the reality was different! All facilities are too old fashioned. And whenever I asked any service| they said “No”. I will never stay here again. Among six hotels I have stayed during this business trip| it was the worst| unfortunately.,Jul 4| 2021,2
Pool closed,Jul 4| 2021,4
Nice stay affordable,Jun 30| 2021,5
The view was incredible. The room was underwhelming.,Jun 29| 2021,3
Amazing customer service| and the room was clean. But the beds need to be updated| pillow soft would be nice. Also| my room had light bulbs out| the refrigerator was broken. The cleaning lady was amazing.,Jun 29| 2021,5
Great location if you want to visit downtown and stay close to financial district. It has many good food options and is very close to The battery and south street seaport.,Jun 29| 2021,4
Rooms are very dated and very clean. Beds were uncomfortable.,Jun 28| 2021,3
I was very disappointed with the overall experience at this hotel. Very very bad service and cleanliness. They didn’t do my room service and said there was nothing they could do about it| the toilet was clogged. Only positive thing was the view.,Jun 27| 2021,1
GHETTO! Hotel rundown| interior of rooms beat up and outdated. Tv did not work| people staying near our room were extremely loud in late hours of night. So disappointed| surprised in quality of hotel for it being near 911 memorial. Would never stay here or recommend this hotel.,Jun 26| 2021,1
Stayed one night in June. Location was great - across the street from the Oculus and WTC memorial. The room was clean and quiet and the staff was friendly. None of the issues mentioned by other reviews. Also| there is a pop up outdoor beer garden across the street. Have a drink and a bite to eat under the new WTC 1,Jun 26| 2021,5
They failed to inform us that the holding fee was going to be $200. The room was small and the products in the bathroom looked used. The refrigerator was dirty and not in working conditions,Jun 25| 2021,3
Room 2011 was dirty| the sofa had stains. The carpet was filthy and stains on the bed spread. I have been waiting for a refund from hotels.com of $472.77 and I have been given the run around. Both experiences were upsetting and unprofessional. I will never do business again with either company,Jun 24| 2021,1
The rooms are old| and need a deep cleaning. If you’re traveling with a group you won’t have any place to sit| talk and eat.| they have no amenities available. I was attacked by a non hotel guest outside the hotel while trying to eat outside had we had some indoor seating it would’ve been avoided. Until they deep clean the rooms and open some amenities| I don’t recommend.,Jun 23| 2021,2
The hotel was nice enough for minimal use. We hadn’t planned to spend too much time in the room as we were only visiting for a few days but the rooms are definitely dated and there were various questionable stains on some of the soft surfaces. It served its purpose and was a great price.,Jun 23| 2021,3
the hotel needs remodeling. for the price of the rooms and the place where it is located it does not have much luxury it was not my best option,Jun 23| 2021,3
The location is the best thing about this hotel| right across the street from the WTC. The view from our room was amazing!  I was disappointed with the staff| nobody ever greeted us at any time we were there. It took forever to find ice. No microwave and no refrigerator.,Jun 23| 2021,4
Checking in at 4pm is too late for previous night travelers.Thanks to Ms. Cynthia| which did an early checking-in| she saved us the day.,Jun 21| 2021,5
I loved the location and view. I didn’t care for the fact that no breakfast was provided or morning coffee| even though restrictions in NY have been lifted. I didn’t like the stain on the carpet for $315/night or the run down cabinet under the tv. I know location| location| location. But! I’m a Hilton member and this place was unfriendly| unhelpful| and unsightly in our room. Bummer as we’re moving out of nyc in a month but wanted one last hoorah.,Jun 21| 2021,3
Awful experience with checking in!! On top of that the people who work at the front desk are extremely rude. Another thing they recommended a parking garage that is extremely expensive (sense there’s no parking around the hotel). There is absolutely no way this is a 4 star hotel!!!,Jun 21| 2021,1
Location is very good but room is dated and dirty.,Jun 20| 2021,4
The location is spectacular! Our room faced the 911 memorial and we could see right into one of the infinity pools where one of the twin towers once stood. It is located near everything. We could either walk or a cab ride if less than 20 dollars hit us wherever we wanted to go. The restaurant and other services were not yet available due to COVID.,Jun 19| 2021,4
Very bang average hotel. Amazing location close to all the relevant subway stops to go uptown| etc.| which is I imagine this hotel is in business in the first place. They use "COVID" as an excuse to not clean rooms (you can only request cleaning once every three days)| and they don't even send people to clean the room once you request cleaning. I just happened to come across the cleaning crew in my hallway and they were extremely kind and went out of their way to clean my room... people downstairs are lacking the competency. Lamps in room were broken| and they didn't even provide a dedicated power strip or charging station next to the beds.Will stay elsewhere in close proximity next time. Cannot stand COVID being used as an excuse to not be transparent.,Jun 16| 2021,3
2 night stay in New York & was disappointed in the condition of the facility. The room was dusty| we requested blankets that we did not receive until we called a second time- the next day. Apparently rooms are only serviced per request (which is the opposite of what is customary) The fan was blowing hot air| had difficulty reaching front desk through the phone. I spoke to a woman at the front desk who was helpful but besides that this experience was not worth the $636 dollars.,Jun 15| 2021,2
Great location on the financial district,Jun 14| 2021,4
One of the best views and really friendly staff.,Jun 14| 2021,5
Good,Jun 13| 2021,5
The view from my suite was awesome. The room had a plenty of room and the hotel was close to the subway and major attractions. I didn't like that the room was outdated| sink was clogged up| the elevators needed maintenance| and there were absolute no amenities made available. I would definitely stay again simply because of the views of the Brooklyn Bridge and how close it is to the subway and major attractions.,Jun 11| 2021,4
I like that it was in a location that was walkable to most attractions however| the hotel is a little outdated. When I walked in the bathroom| it smelled like a wet mop. I figured out that they probably do not wash the shower curtains as they are cloth materials. I didn’t like that I had to pay an extra fee to have a refrigerator in my room. Also| the water pressure in the toilet was weak and could be stronger.,Jun 11| 2021,3
Great stay even if itnwas only.one day.  View was incredible!  Had a view of Ground Zero and the new World Trade Center.,Jun 9| 2021,5
This place is horrible the rooms are so nasty and dirty it was unbelievable how dirty the rooms was the reception workers was so unprofessional i pay almost 300 dollars for a disgusting room the furniture was broken the fridge wasn't working no water at the rooms no air-conditioning ssshhh was crazy,Jun 8| 2021,1
Location was great,Jun 7| 2021,5
Location|location|location.❤️,Jun 6| 2021,5
STAFF WAS VERY RUDE. ROOM T.V WAS OLDER THAN MY DAD . EXPENSIVE ROOM FOR NO REASON.,Jun 5| 2021,1
Love it,Jun 4| 2021,5
Our rooms had great views. The staff was always willing to answer your questions and give advice. It was a great place to stay.,Jun 4| 2021,5
The view was beautiful,Jun 3| 2021,5
Custumer service was very bad| parking lot is to far away the one they recommend| our room was #3112  floor 31 this rooms need a update| mats looks very dirty| bedroom has a bad quality| bad room was dirty,Jun 2| 2021,2
The tv was not working very blurry and they did not clean room while we were touring the city and no clean towel| cups and waters. Overall terrible.,Jun 1| 2021,3
This Hotel denied finding my reservation even when I provided my Expedia confirmation number| the staff didn’t show any interest in help solve the problem even when they saw I had a 1 year old baby with me that needed a place to rest.,Jun 1| 2021,1
Great service,May 31| 2021,5
Good,May 31| 2021,5
Loved the view of the WTC,May 30| 2021,4
Excelente service cleanliness,May 30| 2021,5
I asked for maintenance three times and no one ever went| in the hallway there was always a lot of garbage piled up| because there was nowhere to throw it away and in the three days that I was there they never cleaned it| the room was very dusty like they haven't cleaned for centuries.,May 27| 2021,3
After a long drive to this hotel| we were upset to find the parking lot was closed| after that we had to find off site parking and walk back with our luggage. The room was just OK but the carpet seem to have a blood or a big wine stain| the TV is extremely outdated| no WIFI| mini fridge didn’t work| the phones didn’t work. The pool was closed| as well as the convenient store. And to top it off| the service was awful| you have to show your room key before entering the hotel| the lady asking for room keys had a terrible attitude and was yelling at everyone. I’m confused how this hotel got 4 stars. Will never stay at a Hilton ever again.,May 25| 2021,1
The rooms are very nice and the view is amazing.,May 25| 2021,5
The property is across the street from the twin towers memorial.  You can walk to the pier - nice and quiet morning to enjoy your coffee.  The hotel is convenient to the West Village| Little Italy and Chinatown.,May 24| 2021,5
Beautiful View in out deluxe king city view. affordable and perfectly located next to 9/11 memorial. toilet handle was jiggly but the room was mostly up to date and the staff was excellent,May 24| 2021,4
I like the skyline| but I think| the interior of the room is slightly outdated,May 24| 2021,4
I like the location near WTC. It was somewhat clean and quiet. Found wrapper on the floor and mold in the shower grout. Towels need to be softer. I would probably stay again just for convenience. Bell boy was very friendly and helpful. Found phone system needs upgraded.,May 21| 2021,4
I loved the room it was very scenic and enjoyed my time there| it was close to great food and the subway was a walk across the street. !,May 21| 2021,5
The Staff is absolutely amazing! I will NEVER STAY anywhere else in NYC!,May 20| 2021,5
Lobby unfriendly and ineffective (first room given was not cleaned from previous occupants)Loud neighbors Dirty underwear found in a drawer in the second room Housekeeping came 2 days after we asked for itAC brokenSmells like some now-legal substance was heavily smoked by previous occupants,May 19| 2021,2
The only thing that was great about this room what is the view everything else was terrible the room looked Like it was falling apart in my point of you but in reality the couch bed was dirty some of the cabinets in the room had chipped drawers| There were stains on the bed.,May 18| 2021,1
When I checked-in| I was informed that all building amenities were closed. TV in the room didn't work so they moved me to another room with a broken minifridge that had old orange juice in it. When I wanted to reheat my takeout| I called the front desk and was told they had no more working microwaves. The water pressure in the shower was also shockingly low. Had to go down multiple floors for a working ice machine.  The room was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. Overall disappointing for a 4-star Hilton.,May 18| 2021,2
Stained carpets| worn and dented furniture| old fixtures| nonfunctioning tv and phone.....a long time favorite has lost its appeal| depressing.............,May 18| 2021,2
I really like the location close to alot of things and close to subway which is great when traveling from another state. The views of the city was amazing. The bed pillows however were to soft and gave me a stiff neck however over all enjoyed my stay,May 15| 2021,4
Poor property condition,May 11| 2021,2
Very good location and,May 11| 2021,4
This hotel could be SOOOOO much better than it is. My GF said I should just chalk it up to Covid. We asked for towels on Saturday at 5PM| We got a knock on the door at 530AM the following morning to unlock our bathroom door| total communication issue and that was major problem for us| then they came back 15 min later with towels. No member of the staff came and apologized for the interruption. When we tried to turn on lights or anything it was all unplugged| and there were some serious safety / fire hazards. There was an extension cord running from an unseen outlet behind the headboard| and there was a term strip plugged into that for all the items to be plugged into. The phone was inop due to it not being plugged in and that was a serious safety concern. They began reopening the hotel| and management had no plan in place to make sure that they hotel was in working order. They had months to go through every room and do a safety check. There were plumbing issues with the bathroom sink handles not working correctly| there were parts of the shower handle assemblies missing which were sharp and could cut someone. We got this room for an extremely cheap price| and dealt with the issues| If I had paid the standard $299 I would have been LIVID!  I brought the items to the staffs attention at checkout| maybe something will be done.,May 10| 2021,3
The hotel staff were friendly.,May 10| 2021,5
loved the location and the view was perfect!,May 9| 2021,5
Great,May 9| 2021,5
Place is really nice| solid view and all that fun stuff. The mini fridge didn’t work and was broken looking inside. Not the end of the world. Would for sure recommend the place to friends and family.,May 9| 2021,4
Really terrific view of WTC and the oculus.  Excellent location with lots of food options and close to our FiDI office. Everyone who works at the hotel is very nice and accommodating.  The room didn’t have a fridge| which I really wanted for drinks etc since I was there a week.  I requested one and they brought it right up. Housekeeping only came a few times because of COVID but when I asked they offered to bring up fresh towels and linens.  Only complaints are that the room probably hasn’t been updated since 2001....smelled like long ago cigarettes and there were no convenient places to charge devices.  Also the Wi-Fi was bad| couldn’t do much work from the room.  All in all depending on the price I’d stay there again...but there are newer places nearby (without the view) that I’d try first.,May 8| 2021,3
The only good thing I liked about our room was that it was spacious. Everything else is pretty outdated. The cabinet which the refrigerator was in was missing it’s handled and we couldn’t even open it when we tired. The two little lights above the bed was missing the bulbs. The cooling system| the room was either too cold or too hot. I love the Hilton but this one was absolutely a disappointment.,May 8| 2021,3
Horrible service,May 4| 2021,1
The lady at the front desk (checking) was rude. After checking in I didn’t even wanna stay there but had to coz it was non refundable. The city view was nice,May 4| 2021,3
I love the staff. They were very pleasant. Didnt like the parking was off site.,May 4| 2021,5
I loved the view. But was upset the refrigerator was super dirty and broken. Couldn’t put my wine in there. The remote’s battery needed replaced but couldn’t even call the front desk to request anything because phones didn’t work either.,May 3| 2021,3
Don’t do it,May 3| 2021,1
Would have been nice toKnow that the parking garage at the hotelWas closed. Not sure if that’s a hotels.com problem...,May 2| 2021,3
This hotel urgently needs a renovation or at least some maintenance| it is a shame because it’s location,May 2| 2021,2
Had an amazing stay here. The location was great| I had an awesome view. The staff was friendly and helpful. I felt very safe here during the pandemic. The only con I would say is that it is a little dated and the beds were small but overall I was very pleased with my accommodations.,Apr 29| 2021,5
Views were amazing. Conveniently located near the ferries but about 15-20 min from Times Square. Not a ton of restaurants open in the vicinity but overall relatively quiet area. Parking to check in was a bit of a cluster no area to pull over to drop off/check-in,Apr 28| 2021,4
Great customer service,Apr 27| 2021,5
The view is outstanding| the area is amazing,Apr 27| 2021,5
None smoking residence. View from the room,Apr 26| 2021,4
The room was very clean and the view was spectacular. Will definitely stay there again!,Apr 26| 2021,5
I didn’t like that the staff there treated me differently because I’m a black women,Apr 26| 2021,5
Great place. Close to subway.,Apr 26| 2021,5
Parking was a big issue. lights not working in the room| tv didn't work. request for more towel| we got the towels| toilet paper after requested to speak with manager. :(,Apr 25| 2021,2
The city view was amazing| but no amenities at all. No microwave| no fridge| no room service. Tv channels were lousy.,Apr 25| 2021,3
Experience at check it was outstanding but a few things including Bathtub was damaged but overall it was a pleasant experience.,Apr 25| 2021,3
Terrible place| service sucks.. room is dated and the lights in my room didn’t work neither did the phone so I had to go down 36 floors to complain just for nobody to come fix the problem. Best part about the room is the view. I don’t recommend.,Apr 24| 2021,1
I really like how close two subway stations are down the street and the location is amazing.,Apr 24| 2021,4
They didnt have a microwave| no refrigerator or a parking deck. I had to ride around for like 30 minutes fir a parking twice. Save ya money,Apr 23| 2021,2
The location is great for visiting the World Trade Center etc..,Apr 23| 2021,4
Beautiful place and beautiful views,Apr 22| 2021,5
The hotel is very nice and in a great location (WTC).  The facilities are kept clean| but the décor overall needs a refresh.  I would also like to see better room amenities like a mini-fridge and microwave.  Otherwise| the hotel is superb!,Apr 22| 2021,4
Property Staff was very professional| greeted us at the desk.,Apr 22| 2021,4
Enjoyed my stay.,Apr 20| 2021,4
Was a great place to stay the view is amazing. Very close to things to do and subway station.,Apr 19| 2021,4
Great place!  However| could use a touch of upgrades as the room had obvious signs of wear-and-tear.,Apr 19| 2021,5
I did not like anything about the place but the location. Room smells like weed. No real heat. No microwave or refrigerator. Old and outdated. No accommodations for no restaurant due to Covid. Most hotels. No spoon no forks no bag warmers. No tooth paste and much more. It was all bad including the beds. 750$ for 2/half days. I was better off booking a extended stay. They put up pictures as if the restaurant and rooftop was open &much more when we get there they had No| No|and more no.,Apr 19| 2021,1
This hotel should have been great...but it wasn’t.  There was no air conditioning.  Also| usually hotels have USB charging ports in their rooms.  I have no idea why a hotel in the middle of NYC wouldn’t!  There wasn’t even complimentary coffee.  It really felt like this hotel wasn’t even fully open.  Very disappointing. Not even vending machines?!,Apr 19| 2021,1
It was very neat and clean..........................,Apr 18| 2021,3
Housekeeping never came to clean room. I stayed there 3 days. And asked for room to be cleaned everyday. Front desk said they will scheduled. Never got a room cleaned. TVs in rooms are old. Bath tub clogs up. Front desk rude,Apr 18| 2021,2
Great staff,Apr 11| 2021,5
I had two rooms and one of the rooms had a foul odor coming from the fridge and the roomPhone didn’t work ! & when I called the front desk the gentleman who answered gonna respond with would u like to to change your room before I could answer “ oh it’s too late “ was his comeback! Then they sent someone up stairs to spray bug spray which made the room smell even worst !!!!! Never again,Apr 11| 2021,1
The hotel is ok it’s clean the rooms just need some updating but it’s not bad  the bed was comfortable I had a great time  I love the area  Covid  cause a lot of restrictions  but  everything else was ok| the front desk staff was very pleasant and helpful...,Apr 11| 2021,4
The staff was courteousness but the amenities were no bueno,Apr 11| 2021,2
Hotel itself is gorgeous| view is amazing! Staff was pleasant and helpful. However| the site states there is parking available| we drove in from Ohio. We had to park in a lot across the street| parking for 2 days was $160. Insane cost if you ask me. I asked if there was any type of discount or reimbursement of some sort since the site states parking available| the front desk response was “to be fair it states there is “limited parking available and our parking has been shut down since March due to COVID” well| you might want to update that or make people aware so they can plan accordingly and not be sticker shocked. Otherwise the hotel itself is definitely worth staying at| we had the city view and it was breathtaking. Central to the subway| WTC| and felt safe location. Staff was friendly upon arrival.,Apr 10| 2021,4
I was very disappointed| during check in I learned their parking was not available and it did not state that when I booked the hotel I had to pay 60 dollars a day for the parking garage closest to the hotel and sometimes had to wait for a car to leave to be able to get in. I also asked if I could use a luggage cart I was told no| however I was able to when checking out. In the room there was no refrigerator| microwave| you had to go to the 30th floor to get ice bc all the ice machines were off on the other floors. The coffee pot didn’t work right it leaked all over. It was so hot in the room and the AC didn’t work right. I will never stay at this hotel again. They also don’t tell you the only come clean the room give you fresh towels etc once every 3 days so we had to call. At night when you walked into the lobby they wanted to check your room card which I understand but if you walked by and didn’t have it in the air someone was yelling security. Overall for what I paid to stay in the city this was so disappointing. Was the worst part of the trip walking up sweating.,Apr 7| 2021,2
I had a great view of the World Trade Center a 5 star,Apr 7| 2021,5
I did not know that every part of the Hotel was affected by covid. There is absolutely nothing to do here besides going outside getting food and coming back. My birthday was ruined| that’s for sure.,Apr 7| 2021,1
Disappointed with Expedia customer srervice would like refund horrible experience,Apr 6| 2021,1
The parking garage was closed for renovations. AC wasn’t enabled - room was hot and could not be cooled. Phone was inoperable. TV was static and difficult to see. Had the run the fan on all not and did not get good sleep.  Bathroom was dirty.  No trash bags in the trash cans. Front desk was polite but was not helpful.,Apr 6| 2021,1
The best part of it was the tourist attraction the One world trade center the least I liked about it I booked the junior suite when I arrived in my room the carpet was disgusting the tables were not clean and the room had a nasty odor I called the front desk immediately and they gave me another sweet not an upgrade but a regular sweet like the one I had already booked after traveling 6 hours hours way too tired since we arrived late at night this room was also disgusting so I just bought stuff to clean it..I open a section that supposed to be a refrigerator I think and it was disgusting and it let out the worst odor in the room that I've ever smelled the tables had clearly dust that show through the glass and the window seals was scratched up shower area was not clean the next day a housekeeper came around and said do you need towels they never asked for the room to be cleaned so the day after I called down for housekeeping scheduled it for 10:15 I leave the room for 3 hours just to come back and the room was still dirty call down and let front desk know that housekeeping never came they made up 100 excuses why did the housekeeper came and said it was front desk and housekeeping fault they never told her to clean it being that this is a main attraction to this city this was the worst experience I've ever had my first time in New York City then they recommended the little man parking where the guys wore a new pair of my shoes and placed them back in the car the next day,Apr 6| 2021,2
The room was good| but they had refrigerator that didn’t work. They claimed because of Covid. Tv doesn’t have a lot of options. I had a nice view though.,Apr 6| 2021,4
When I arrived in my room I realized that the window was open all the way. I informed the concierge and he placed me in another room because the window was broke. What I didn’t like about my stay was the workout room. It was closed the whole weekend. They placed a “Closed for the weekend” sign on the door. I feel like that should be something they inform people about before they book. I missed out on 2 days of working out because I thought the hotel had a functioning gym. Also| no ice on my 25th floor room. Another sign posted said “30th floor for ice. I expected more from a Hilton; a Hilton in Manhattan! The only great part about my stay was the concierge he helped a lot. Recommended a bus tour and even gave me another mask when I left mines upstairs. Disappointed!,Apr 5| 2021,2
beautiful building. view from our small suite was breathtaking. it definitely delivered.,Apr 5| 2021,5
Very luxurious and classy I will most definitely stay here on my next business trip to New York,Apr 5| 2021,5
The front desk staff (first impression creators) were not friendly nor welcoming.  They did not seem to want to speak other than in one or two words. (name? Credit card? Keys here..). The room view was nice. The toilet was broken and continuously flushed. Room furniture very old and outdated. The standing light was missing a light bulb completely. The room thermostat was not responding to adjustment buttons. Bed was so uncomfortable you can feel the mattress spring coils. Oh| man. I have never experienced such a bad room at any Hilton. Due to Covid; I did not want to complain or request for a room change. We stuck it out since we planned spend most of the time outside the hotel.,Apr 4| 2021,2
Great view with outdated rooms. It feels great being at the top but the rooms are old! TVs are outdated flatscreens so I didn’t get a razor sharp HD view.,Apr 4| 2021,4
Fantastic location and fantastic views.,Apr 3| 2021,3
Hotel is closely located to really cool sites. Major issue for me was the carpets in the hallway and rooms were stained & looked dirty.,Apr 2| 2021,3
The rooms were dirty with stains on the carpet and furniture.,Apr 2| 2021,1
The hotel was BEAUTIFUL. I’ll always stay there when I visit New York. The only thing missing was a fridge. A lot of food went to waste because I had no place for it. I used the A/C vent to keep some things at least cool and a bucket of ice for some ice cream. The bed was cozy and the view was spectacular.,Apr 2| 2021,4
The place was clean and well kept| one problem we had was that the AC was kept at 78 degrees by default so sleeping underneath the semi comfortable covers without sweating was impossible. When we called to have it lowered| the front desk said they were sending somebody up to fix it but to no avail nobody came.,Apr 1| 2021,2
The hotel is not a 4 stars hotel. The furniture in the room was just broken| the TV was from the 90s| the carpet was dirty| no fridge or minibar in the room| etc.,Apr 1| 2021,2
It was beautiful hotel . Nice staff and friendly. Neighborhood was decent lots of options for food . Beautiful view and very clean .,Mar 31| 2021,5
The worst Hilton I’ve been to. Whole place smelled like weed. Rooms are poorly maintain. Windows were shaking so badly during the gale winds on the 39th floor. Had to check out the next day. Would not recommend,Mar 30| 2021,1
I would recommend it for your stay in New York| in the heart of New York you have everything at your fingertips.  This hotel deserves one more star.,Mar 30| 2021,4
Relaxed and quiet. Just what I needed.,Mar 30| 2021,5
This was a wonderful experience| the room was nice and clean| had a beautiful view | it felt like home. I can’t wait for my next stay,Mar 29| 2021,5
the place looked terrible| nothing looked clean smelled bad,Mar 29| 2021,1
Our hotel room was not properly cleaned. Upon our arrival| the bathroom floor was wet. Our hotel phone did not work| neither did the air conditioner so the room got super humid and hot during the night.,Mar 29| 2021,2
Wonderful place to stay but wish they were more specific on no parking because it was under construction an no microwave no mini bar but the view was beautiful,Mar 29| 2021,5
Not updated| bathroom sink was broken| the concierge was accommodating and helpful but they do need to update the rooms,Mar 29| 2021,2
The check in was very unorganized. Our room and hallways smelled like marijuana the whole stay and no one from the organization offered us a new room. They never gave us new towels the whole stay and they never answered the phone. Very unprofessional and bad customer service.,Mar 29| 2021,1
The location is perfect if you are visiting the Oculus or One World Trade Center.  Very nice views.  Unfortunately the hot water is intermittent and we had a very hot few days in March and the weren't able to turn on the air conditioning.  It was around 79 degrees in the room the entire time. The customer service was less than expected.,Mar 29| 2021,3
Unprofessional staff with luck of communication,Mar 28| 2021,2
The staff is very rude there was big party going on cops were called People roaming around the hotel,Mar 28| 2021,1
Hotel sucked kicked my 18 old out on her 18th birthday because a misunderstanding,Mar 28| 2021,1
It is a great Hotel I enjoyed my stay!❤️,Mar 27| 2021,5
We booked the one bedroom suite and the view was fabulous. The rooms were spacious and the staff were helpful.  No fridge or microwave| and the jacuzzi jets weren’t working| only complaints,Mar 27| 2021,5
I loved that the concierge was always so open and willing to answer all our questions. He knew everything we asked.,Mar 26| 2021,5
Amazing views . Great location . Bed was comfy but furniture could be updated.  Overall good hotel,Mar 26| 2021,5
staff was great and friendly they let me check in a little early to my room wich was really nice! deff staying there again! highly recomendable hotel! and very close to brooklyn bridge!! blocks away!,Mar 25| 2021,5
The staff was polite and friendly. The room was a bit outdated.,Mar 25| 2021,5
Hotel is aging and in need of a refresh. Decent accommodations| amazing location and views.,Mar 24| 2021,3
Great time as one views,Mar 23| 2021,4
The view of Trinity church | the access to the 9/12 memorial  & other areas such as the south street seaport,Mar 23| 2021,3
Out of everything the only nice thing was the view and its because they had nothing to do about it. Our rooms furniture were broken and the glasses for water were cracked we ask for a replacement and they gave us paper cups. Everything was closed to use and there was hidden fees that weren't told about. On top of that everything that was going on outside was able to be heard as we went for a relaxing weekend we ended up not able to sleep because of everyone slaming the doors. Before checking in I asked about parking and they said it was free for us but once we got there the front desk said we didnt get to have parking so we had to go somewhere else and pay 108 dollars for parking too. I would not go there ever again.,Mar 23| 2021,1
The hotel room was dirty. I literally cleaned it to stay in. I was very disappointed. Whole place needs to be updated and properly cleaned especially with COVID.,Mar 23| 2021,1
They charge me 70$ more and I’m waiting 1 hour they give me wrong key,Mar 23| 2021,1
Horrible they didn’t offer nothing that was advertised. There was no parking. Parking was 3 blocks away for $70 a night. They didn’t have a functioning restaurant like they said nor a mini bar in the room.,Mar 22| 2021,1
Horrible hotel...........!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Mar 22| 2021,1
The hotel is so outdated lot of the plugs didn’t work lot of  lights didn’t work and there’s no fridge but an amazing view,Mar 22| 2021,1
It’s a great property. Room is elegant & efficient. Staff is accommodating. But the location provides breathtaking views that are unique and beyond comparison.,Mar 22| 2021,5
The view is amazing| and the hotel is close to all of downtown| but the rooms need upgrading| and the property and rooms were not as clean as they should be--especially not in the age of COVID 19. The office chair in my room had stains on it| there were fingerprints under the glass part of the table| and fingerprints and a decent amount of dust on the windowsills. Fortunately I travel with disinfecting wipes and spray| so I squared things away. There were maskless guests in the lobby| and discarded masks in an elevator. We stayed here 2 years ago| and it's disappointing to see how much the property has declined. The staff| however| are still first rate.,Mar 21| 2021,4
Excellent view of lower Manhattan. Good price and off site parking,Mar 21| 2021,5
Thank you for the great stay! All needs were met :) happy to come again ;)),Mar 21| 2021,4
The view was absolutely beautiful. We enjoyed the Junior Suite and amenities. Bathroom shower curtain smelled rancid and a dirty glove was insife the doorway,Mar 19| 2021,5
Easy check in| amazing view of the Freedom Tower,Mar 19| 2021,4
Great place to stay when you want to visit the WTC Memorial and museum. Also| the hotel is within walking distance to the Ferry for Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island. The heat was not working in our room. Thank goodness it was a nice weekend.The amenities (gym| pool| breakfast) were closed when we got there but shown as open on the website. The room has a mini fridge that was disassembled| so there was nowhere to put our leftovers.,Mar 19| 2021,3
View is AMAZING!!! What keeps us coming back..would like mini fridge to have worked & a microwave but still enjoyed ourselves.,Mar 19| 2021,5
I didnt like the fact I had to walk to long to park,Mar 19| 2021,4
This hotel is in SERIOUS need of investment and upgrade.  The room was dated| the bed was really uncomfortable| and there was little to no staff on site to assist with problems| which in my case were many.  The 25th floor stank of marijuana in the common areas| and it even wafted under the bedroom door and woke me up.  It was so intense. The check-in process was a total disaster - hoards of people and a single agent at the desk.  She was helpful and polite - no doubt - but the expectation that one person can check in a hundred people is ridiculous.Would not recommend this hotel.,Mar 17| 2021,1
Nice hotel.  A bit dated but the view was great and the location convenient.,Mar 16| 2021,5
Being in the heart of the City and observing microaggression's isn't an unusual combination. Now I understand that all hotels have policy's and regulations they have to follow| however you can't pick and choose who regulations and policy's apply to. When entering the hotel the lady had made it clear to me that "no smoking in rooms was permitted",Mar 16| 2021,1
Room had window left open for ventilation which is understandable. Hotel heating system and thermostats are flawed and doesn't keep the room to proper temperatures.If you book a room and there is a vacant room next door| the window will be left open in that room and therefore the door to that connected room will constantly shake and be hit with strong winds.,Mar 16| 2021,3
We stayed 3 nights/2 days. The men in charge of receiving guests wasn’t friendly it all. He didn’t explain about the extra fees or the health screening we supposed to fill. When we or other people asked about it he was very rude. Besides that| the first day we received the cleaning service but not the second day. We asked for it| they said they will work on that before that end of the day but it never happened.,Mar 16| 2021,4
The only part that I like enjoy was the view. The room overall was ok just didn’t like that I had to wipe down the desk top| counter top and the top of the dresser because it was so dirty and full of finger prints. On top of that rust from under the sink was falling. It look so nasty| I had to cover it up with a towel. The bed was very comfortable I would say 6/10 overall.,Mar 16| 2021,2
This is an excellent location with incredible views! The staff are accommodating. We are in the midst of a pandemic| I don’t want to be too harsh.  Hope that the hotel will invest in its infrastructure. It has deteriorated vastly.,Mar 15| 2021,3
Overall my stay at this hotel was nothing but Disappointing. I don’t know if it was because of the pandemic but upon entering the room| there was trash within it. The phone didn’t work and was not looked at during our stay after requesting it to be fixed and the mini refrigerator was broken| when we asked for a replacement| the management told us it could be replaced upon request. When we requested one| they said it was discontinued. No Microwave available within the rooms. NO FOOD was served to their guests but rather your order it yourself and meet the delivery person in the lobby. Overall wouldn’t come back to this hotel would go to the Hilton Garden Inn on 28th st near Penn Station.,Mar 15| 2021,2
Worse hotel I ever stayed at. Loud guest| smell of smoke| broken elevators| and water pipe in room stopped working. No apologies or anything done about it. Very low customer service. Absolutely unprofessional.,Mar 15| 2021,1
Two days of hell. No elevator on Saturday from the 34 th floor. Water went off Sunday and we were forced to change rooms,Mar 15| 2021,2
It was pretty good the only thing people was making noises and smoking even in areas that they shouldn’t... but that’s under every personal behavior doesn’t go really under the hotel but the rest was pretty good under the limits we still live in now a days,Mar 15| 2021,4
The view of the 40th floor was nice i was able to see the world trade center and more .,Mar 14| 2021,5
This is the most disgusting “motel” I’ve ever been to. The rooms are outdated and the upkeep is deplorable. There were stains and remnants of past guests everywhere.,Mar 14| 2021,2
I love everything about the facility and the cleanliness of this hotel and views are amazing.,Mar 14| 2021,5
I loved the view from my room| but not the fact that had i used the wifi while in my room i would've had to pay for it. I've stayed in p!enty of hotels and I've never paid to use wifi..,Mar 14| 2021,4
View of the Freedom Tower from the 30th floor was incredible,Mar 13| 2021,4
We checked into what is honestly one of the worst hotel rooms I've ever stayed in. Granted I prepaid through Expedia| so I suspect you get the duds| but still.  There was no a/c in the room - heat only - and it was 85F per the in room thermometer.  Called downstairs to be told that we could crank the window| which we did.  Helped air the room but so noisy.  Then we discovered TV remote didn't work and toilet was running.  Maintenance provided a new remote but couldn't fix toilet as needed a part which they didn't have on site.  So we slept| feeling like we were on the edge of Niagara Falls.  Beds were uncomfortable| room decor dated and in need of serious facelift.  Would not recommend this hotel.,Mar 12| 2021,1
I’m not sure if the 5/5 reviews are real people. When you get to the hotel| the lobby is 3.5 out of 5. You make your way to the elevator and see weird carpet inside of it| that’s the first clue that this may not be what you thought. As soon as the elevator doors open you will instantly regret booking. I am almost certain that this place must’ve been a nursing home or was designed to be one. We were told that the fridges were out of service due to Covid. I’m not sure how the two are related. I still decided to open the fridge in my room| there was pieces of food in the fridge . There were stains on the walls| carpet and cabinets| the bathroom was also dusty. The toilets are hideous. Phones are not cleaned. After seeing this| we we requested another room. When I got to the next room there was urine already in the toilet. Rooms are not kept vacant for a day after checkout. I witnessed a person check out and new people check in within hours of each other. It gives a motel kind of vibe. Super disappointed.,Mar 10| 2021,2
The room was not clean at all..the bathroom toilet at brown stains im not sure if that was due to the toilet seat being old but it was eyesore .The covers had black stains so i slept on top of the covers ..The tv didnt work..when i booked the room it said " parking available " when i arrived they said the garage was closed since march of 2020. So i had to pay for parking around the corner which was $50 for 12 hours. The refrigerator didnt work either. Be aware there is a $75 holding fee included in your hotel stay. I did receive that back the next day though. The view was Great from my room at night i was on the 48th floor.,Mar 9| 2021,3
I like the views from the room 😊I dislike the old rooms they have There was a refrigerator in the room but it wasn’t working it was broke some of the lights didn’t work  and the price on the movies omg 😱,Mar 9| 2021,4
NO PARKING FOR THIS HOTEL!I thought my stay included parking as the description stated but there are no parking garages open around this hotel. I had to pay and find street parking.My shower was also broken| and it was cold throughout the night. Because I onlt stayed one night this was fine but I’d probably stay somewhere else next time I go to NYC.,Mar 8| 2021,3
Good overall. I have no complaints for my stay. It was one night only.,Mar 8| 2021,4
It was ok. Beds are really uncomfortable and sheets where a little stain.,Mar 8| 2021,3
Accessible  to public transportation. Friendly staff,Mar 8| 2021,5
I didn’t like that almost everything I needed wasn’t available due to COVID. Paired with the outdated interior| out of service refrigerator| no microwaves| no amenities available| pool and gym closed.... the price wasn’t worth it whatsoever. Overpriced by far and room reeked of cigarettes. Was a bit nauseating. The view was the only thing that saved the overall rating and made it an ‘ok’ experience instead of terrible.,Mar 7| 2021,3
My room was dusty all around. I asked a guy downstairs in the lobby| not a doorman- i think he was a maintenance guy| for forks and knives. I came downstairs because room service instructed me to. I asked the guy and he said I’d have to leave the building because there were no forks or knives in the entire building. I repeated my question to make sure he understood and he still held his ground. I then asked the front desk clerk and immediately she went in the back room and got me utensils within seconds. That alone tainted my experience.,Mar 7| 2021,3
I Loved everything it was Beautiful I recomend this hotel,Mar 6| 2021,5
Overall it was OK but tub in a drain sink then a drain no parking on site had to walk blocks away and pay for parking more than one time due to no overnight parking,Mar 5| 2021,4
My room was not as nice as I expected| the chair was chipped| in between the desk was garbage| the outlet at the desk was not working| couldn't get on their wifi| the carpet was no vacuumed properly| while stepping out of the bathroom something sharp prickedthe bottom of my foot from the carpet. I was just fed up. However i had a great view from my window.,Mar 5| 2021,3
I loved this hotel. It’s really beautiful| clean and safe. Thanks,Mar 3| 2021,5
The view was amazing! Staff was friendly. Some repairs were needed to the room| including the thermostat.,Mar 2| 2021,4
What is unique and good about the property it’s the location but the rooms suck| beautiful view of the city downtown the more your up but such an ugly room and not so clean,Mar 1| 2021,2
Great hotel. Very clean . The view is delightful| right across from One World Trade Center and 911 memorial. Also short walk to Brooklyn bridge | Statue of Liberty| New York Stock Exchange,Mar 1| 2021,5
The view from the room was fantastic! The hotel is conveniently located across the Oculus with easy access to train and buses to explore the city.,Mar 1| 2021,5
The views and the convenience of the subway stations were the best things about the hotel. There was also plenty of space in thr junior suite. We disliked was the dated decor| electric sockets in tye room that wouldn't firmly hold a plug| and no fridge or microwave.,Mar 1| 2021,4
Excellent service all in general,Mar 1| 2021,5
Relatively safe and quiet. I enjoyed my stay. Convenient.,Mar 1| 2021,5
Due to Covid everything still closed so there are no amenities.  Price should be lowered,Mar 1| 2021,3
The view was spectacular. The room was spacious| comfortable and clean.,Mar 1| 2021,4
Loved the view out the window but I did not like that the ladyvat the counter gave me a hard time over nothing,Feb 28| 2021,4
I enjoyed staying here| I had the pleasure of a top floor where skyscrapers were on display. Beautiful sight to see once night comes. The floor was quiet and my room was so relaxing and calm. I truly enjoyed myself| the reviews don’t live up to how wonderful the stay was. And I saved SO much for a lavish stay.,Feb 28| 2021,5
I booked this hotel because I wanted to surprise my fiancé as a valentines Gift to him and also as a little getaway for the two of us| my first bad impression wasn’t even at the hotel it was on the phone when I called to ask how was the parking situation and they told me their parking wasn’t available| so basically if I didn’t call them they wouldn’t notify me of anything and this is Manhattan where parking is extremely a pain in the a*** when we got to the hotel No body said “hi” at least The front desk person just asked for my ID and my for me to Swipe my credit card without any explanation and charged me 150$ which he’s I got back after my check out| Overall the room was pretty and I did ask for a crib and they sent it right up and better customer service team would’ve made my stay more pleasant.,Feb 27| 2021,3
LOOOOOVED MY VIEW. So perfect for my birthday. BOOK THE JUNIOR SUITE! 4211 is where i stayed & it was beauuuuuutiful. I loved it so much. My room wasnt that deeply cleaned prior to me stay tho.,Feb 26| 2021,5
The suite that i had was a great size. But the room and curtains smelled like cigarettes. You can tell the couch and floors haven’t been cleaned in years. There were stains on the floors.,Feb 26| 2021,3
My room was very underrated. The water was uncomfortably hot| the beds were small and unstable. The beds made noise as soon as we laid down and wobbled. The iron push button was broken. The room just wasn’t up to par!,Feb 25| 2021,2
I love this hotel very nice and clean.Food is good service is excellent!,Feb 25| 2021,5
Hotel was clean and privacy was maintained. Check in was okay and staff minds their business.,Feb 23| 2021,5
Wonderful hotel| excellent location| love the view| staff is more than welcoming and wonderfully helpful| thank you!,Feb 23| 2021,5
The hotel is VERY TIRED AND WORN. I was amazed what has historically been a great hotel has really aged. Loud mechanical systems; carpet worn out; dirty elevators; etc.,Feb 23| 2021,1
Love it,Feb 22| 2021,5
Average hotel. Comfortable and spacious room. Walls are super thin though| couldn't sleep because of the party happening in the next room over. Not the most modern of hotels| but not outdated either. Close to a lot of great places to eat. Easily walkable to many other things. Seems to be a disconnect between the hotel and hotels.com| so if you make any specific requests| you'll have to double check them with the hotel. My request for a late check out was not on the hotels radar until I called and asked for it the morning of check out.,Feb 22| 2021,4
Loby was too busy with guest hanging out . overall the process to check in was speedy.,Feb 22| 2021,5
The hotel was ok. The room could have been cleaner and the staff could have been nicer.,Feb 22| 2021,3
So disappointed in this hotel. It’s Covid and they say they use extra  cleaning precautions and I checked into my room and noticed the next morning when I was putting my shoes on and there was rose petals under the bed. Clearly they aren’t cleaning very well. When I went to the front desk to tell them a worker said maybe they’re yours and what do you want to do about it and was extremely rude. I asked for my room to be cleaned. It never was and I proceeded to go down there two more times to very rude people and it never was cleaned. While I was down there I heard two other people complaining about the cleanliness of the room. While I was there I also sent a message through Facebook and that was useless and I also emailed the corporate and that was useless. So if you  like a dirty room stay here,Feb 22| 2021,1
Great staff| clean rooms| beautiful view,Feb 22| 2021,5
I love the view  and the cleanliness the hotel have,Feb 22| 2021,5
Hotel was not as clean as reviews made it seem. Super thin walls let you hear absolute everything and no amenities AT ALL bc of COVID. did not find out until check in bc it is not disclosure in their website!,Feb 22| 2021,1
well honestly I don't like we don't have anything included| no breakfast area nothing and the most worst the parking omg is so cold and we need to walk from the parking outside to the hotel,Feb 22| 2021,4
Great views. Cleanliness was ok. Concierge could have been a little friendlier during check in process. But overall it was a great stay,Feb 21| 2021,5
First room smelled like marijuana. Area around the elevators also smelled like marijuana. Hotel moved us. Second room had moldy shower walls (in the grout line). Asked maid to clean the mold. Returned to room and bathroom wall was still moldy. I don't know if this was just an isolated incident or norm at this hotel| but it's not acceptable at a Hilton.,Feb 21| 2021,2
730pm Check-in took about 30-40 mins| only one woman working and long line. The room looks nicer in the pictures. Walls are paper thin (heard distributing noises that I’m scarred for life now). We were woken up by very loud rattling of the vents| it goes on for about 20/30 mins| you sit in bed wide awake waiting until it stops so you can go back to sleep. Got the King Bed city view| the view was the best part. Will try another hotel next time.,Feb 21| 2021,3
Dirty bathroom| pillows smelled like an old man| elevator stopped at the wrong hight it was scary| customer servi e not friendly at all| i stayed on one floor And sister and her husbNd stayed on a different floor and there were loud parties on both floors till like 2am.  There was a guy standing by the main door smokinh marihuan at 830am. Had to cut short our stay to say the least. Very sketchy hotel,Feb 21| 2021,1
Just don’t go. It’s dirty| it smelled bad| once you get past the lobby and step off the elevator you realize you’ve made a mistake. The carpet and paint need to be changed. It smells faintly of weed and strongly of mildew. We had 3 nights booked| we stayed one but cancelled and booked somewhere else for the remaining two. It’s a party hotel. And it’s passed it’s glory days on that even. Great view| good location.,Feb 20| 2021,1
I will definitely stay at this hotel again in the future.,Feb 19| 2021,5
It was a beauty  view room was clean and very quiet,Feb 19| 2021,5
It was very dirty. The carpet looked like it was nkt vacuumed in years. The fridges were broken and there was rotten food. The handles to the dresser were missing or broken. The shower had mold. The plugs were broken. The phone was broken. The tv was not working properly. Extremely disappointed and multiple rooms the same. Worse than a motel,Feb 18| 2021,3
Didn’t like that the fridges were not available for the rooms. Our room had no towels when we came in and had to order them to receive them. Barely any toilet paper.,Feb 17| 2021,2
Very attractive location right across the street from One World Trade Center (aka The Freedom Tower). You can tell this hotel was once very sophisticated and brought in all types of people. Unfortunately| it isn't maintained great anymore and you have a lot of sketchy people staying there. The weekend I was there there was a party in the next room until 2:00am and you could definitely smell weed. Not a terrible experience but it could surely use some upgrades.,Feb 17| 2021,4
the hotel to me gets a lot of guests because it is near the world  trade center. Thats the only reason I can see why. It us not modern looking like other hotels at all. They do not have a smart tv| the bathroom was so so weird I’ve never seen a toilet like that. When we got there the toilet was already clogged and when i noticed that the water just kept coming up someone had to come fix it.  The fridge did not work at all. There was only 1 ice machine for all guests resulting in a line,Feb 16| 2021,3
HORRIBLE. We left early and I would never stay there again.,Feb 16| 2021,1
They should have valet parking or have a near by parking garage and keep the panhandlers from in front of the property entrance,Feb 16| 2021,5
The bathroom curtains were dirty. The room AC wasn’t cooling enough. Parking was horrible. I ended up leaving a day earlier and booking another hotel.,Feb 16| 2021,2
fix the tvs please 😤...............................,Feb 15| 2021,3
The room smelled horrible because there was old food in the refrigerator.  The coffee maker still had coffee in it.  The whole experience was bad.,Feb 15| 2021,1
Sorry to say| I was disappointed in the hotel.  The room was clean but there was a cigarette smell in the room.  In addition| the website said there was parking however| when I checked in I was told| no parking| here's a car for parking but it is NOT affiliated with our hotel.  The agent didn't seem interested in being helpful to my family.  we waited for 15 minutes for an elevator when checking out.,Feb 15| 2021,3
This place is bad. Not clean and also the service was terrible. The elevators took forever and people were not six feet apart,Feb 15| 2021,1
We were not aware that this hotel  had NO PARKING AND WE HAD TO OAY $160 for parking that was crazy. Very unhappy. So much dust in the hotel rooms. Dust on the lamps. Not clean,Feb 15| 2021,2
The hotel room view is amazing...but they had no refrigerator| no microwave| the heat wasnt working in one part of the room and they expect you to place the trash bags in the bins.,Feb 14| 2021,4
Not as nice as listed . Claimed to have black out curtains but they where to short for that windows . Listed a bunch of amenities with the room | have where not there .,Feb 14| 2021,2
Everything was perfect except not a lot of amenities because of covid. Despite that I enjoyed my stay.,Feb 13| 2021,5
It was horrible,Feb 13| 2021,1
The view was amazing. The staffs were very nice too. The only thing was the tv did not worked and the telephone| we had to go downstairs to get it fixed. The good thing is that they came to fix it within 5 minutes we thought it would take longer. They also need to put Netflix or YouTube| the channels they have are boring and old.,Feb 13| 2021,4
Sadly the good days of this hotel are over!  I used to love this hotel for its location and it’s views but the decor and quality have just not been maintained.  The first room we checked into had a pretty severe leak in the bedroom!  The couches look like they have come to the end of their lives and the TVs did not work!!,Feb 13| 2021,2
SARA HELP ME SHE PASS BEYOND HER HELP...ROOMS WAS NOT CLEAN .,Feb 13| 2021,1
I liked the view from the room. I did not like how it was old fashioned| bathroom was really loud at night. Room service came after two days. Bathroom lock messed up. Bed was uncomfortable.,Feb 12| 2021,1
It was very spacious and the views were nice but| the bathtub was not clean at all and there was an opened water bottle left on the desk.,Feb 12| 2021,4
Friendly customer service| gorgeous king suite| everything went smoothly except for the bellhop situation. Receptionist told me to look for a specific person outside to help me with the bags| but I couldn't find him| so we had to wing it and leave the car in a non-parking-space and sprint with our bags upstairs.,Feb 11| 2021,4
I enjoyed the view it was a great stay.,Feb 10| 2021,5
ALWAYS GOOD,Feb 10| 2021,5
Place is beautiful but the staff wasn’t friendly or looked like they wanted to be there. The phone system didn’t work and we had to walk down to the elevator and go to the lobby to ask questions. We bought a bottle of wine but couldn’t open it cause the didn’t have a corkscrew. Ask the front desk they answered with we are out or check your room,Feb 10| 2021,5
It was a nice view and social distancing was well implemented.,Feb 10| 2021,5
Nice place to stay. The room was clean and the view was nice. I would definitely stay at this Hotel again.,Feb 8| 2021,4
Nice hotel | nice view and excellent service.......... thank you,Feb 8| 2021,5
Very clean and friendly staff. Highly recommend. I will be returning soon.,Feb 8| 2021,4
The views were awesome| location to transit and sites could not have been easier!,Feb 7| 2021,5
Rooms looked better online. Very small and the rooms were freezing,Feb 5| 2021,3
It was suppose to be a luxury suite well they need to take out the word luxury because it was nothing luxury about that room. The room was not clean and it had an o odor. The handle was broken on the bedroom door. The phone was not working. I could not believe they would even offer anyone that room.,Feb 5| 2021,1
No one cleaned room during stay.  Hotel is basically closed,Feb 3| 2021,4
The hotel feels dilapidated and very outdated. The shower in our junior suite did not have a hand-held attachment| there was constant loud banging noise coming from outside the windows. We have booked a two weeks stay but had to check out after one night and move to a different hotel.,Feb 2| 2021,2
Everything was great thank you for the experience see you again one day,Feb 2| 2021,5
The view was beautiful. Only downfall i was told the day before my check in that it was $50 per night for accidental fee which would b refunded. Total $150 since i stayed 3 nights. I got there and was then told it was $75 per which came up to $225 smh. No food no pool no gym and the fridge in the room was broken. It was a quiet stay but dey need to really do better.,Feb 1| 2021,2
property was decent and the location is excellent but it was very crowded and there was almost always a line for the elevator. the heat in the room didn't work and we booked and paid for a king bed and got a queen. the view was decent though.,Feb 1| 2021,2
It was fine!,Feb 1| 2021,4
I didn’t like that they didn’t have refrigerators most places do and not even a microwave. But other than that everything else was great.,Jan 31| 2021,3
The amenities were horrible. No refrigerator| no vending machines or place to purchase beverages late night| ice weren’t on the floor. Just not the greatest amenities but the views are stunning.,Jan 31| 2021,2
Beautiful view| and the room was very clean and spacious| there was no parking tho had to pay 60 for overnight parking somewhere down the street|,Jan 31| 2021,5
From when we first checked in until I left| my friend and I were treated very rudely by the front desk associate and was made to feel undeserving of staying there. Once we got into the room| we ran the shower And noticed that the shower water and the water in the sink were muddy brown and we quickly called maintenance who came to our door and had a very nasty attitude. Anytime we needed any information or had a problem and we called zero from The phone in the room| no one ever answered us. This was a horrible state and I would never stay there again!,Jan 29| 2021,1
I expected a bit more for being a Hilton hotel| but I felt comfortable| and the view was spectacular,Jan 28| 2021,4
No ameneties so dont expect anything but your bedroom.,Jan 26| 2021,3
Nice neighborhood tbh . It was pretty cool experience for it being my time . Would go again. My only complaint it’s that I wish they gave me a higher room to see the veiw.,Jan 25| 2021,5
This place is outdated and needs to be remodeled. Stains on the carpet| curtains and sofa. Plugs are outdated| coffee machine did not work....I will never stay here again.,Jan 24| 2021,3
Didn’t get my security deposit back even though there was no damage to the room.,Jan 23| 2021,2
Beautiful view but unfortunately no clean & the front desk staff unhelpful,Jan 23| 2021,2
Wanted to have a me day in the city so decided to stay here. The photos on the site should the room to be bigger. So I was surprised when I walked in and the room was tiny. Honestly if this hotel was not in the location that it was in and plus the view| it would be border line motel/hotel. The bath room| the small space| even the hallways looked motel like. Seems like things need to be updated. Also the website did not disclose that certain amenities would be closed. When I checked out there was nothing saying the pool| dining| and gym would be closed. I packed for all of these things and only found out when they handed you a sheet upon check in. I believe that is something that should be broadcasted on the website before purchase. And you pay so much money| how is check in 4pm. By 4pm your day is practically over| and check out is at 11am| when check in is so late ?!?,Jan 21| 2021,3
Definitely had good time and enjoyed the view. The layout and décor seems like it can use a bit of an upgrade| but it still gets an 8.5 out of 10 from me. I was happy with my stay!,Jan 20| 2021,4
My Sunday last Sunday was not what I was expecting from a Hilton hotel. Carpet floor was smelly and outdated.  Heating system was malfunctioning and operating it was a hassle . It’s a shame to have a Hilton chaine with such old air control system.Sheets were stained and had hair . Hallways had a terrible odor and TV signal was mediocre . Overall my  experience was horrible that I ended up leaving and staying over with family . I’m asking you respectfully to refund me as I’m not planning on staying at this hotel again !!,Jan 18| 2021,1
My reservation wasn’t even found in the system and the front desk person had a terrible attitude. My advice to anyone is if you hate your job so much just leave it.,Jan 18| 2021,3
The guy at the front desk and the manager argues with a lot of people in front of me and with me. I don’t think they should work there at all.,Jan 18| 2021,1
Clean room| nice staff | however tv and phone did not work,Jan 16| 2021,3
I had an amazing stay thank you 😊,Jan 15| 2021,5
I loved everything especially the view . The do need to upgrade some tv’s one room we stayed in the tv was old and staticky. But we then upgraded when we stayed on night 2 . Overall the stay was great me and my boyfriend loved it.,Jan 15| 2021,5
Walked in and the cleaning staff was spraying the front desk with some liquid which went straight into my eye|the hotel only told her to stop and didn’t ask me if I was ok or nothing|he checked me in and gave me keys|room phone wasn’t working|kept calling the desk using my cell literally begging for drinking water which was brought up after 40minutes|terrible stay hated it only positive side the room was clean and had a beautiful view of the World Trade Center|towels were old rough and horrible I,Jan 15| 2021,1
Excellent hotel with a fabulous view. Very confortable and in the center of Downtown at a reasonable price|,Jan 13| 2021,5
room view was spectacular| after i checked in and paid they informed me| pool is closed| restaurant and café as well| room service is available every other day ... checking in was not as pleasant as i wanted it to be in general| clerk was a bit rude - there was no one to help with bags -  1st room that i checked in was filthy| had to wait for them to provide me with a different room| like i said the only positive thing i can say about this stay was the view,Jan 12| 2021,3
The TV in the living room didnt work| we called the front desk| they said someine will come uo to our room| no one evwr showed up....,Jan 11| 2021,5
Most of the extra stuff is off limits which I get due to covid . But that just means your staffing needs to be 120% more on there game. No one smiles . No one welcomes you. And upon my leaving your front desk told me a lie just to get me out. You need to teach everyone about customers service !,Jan 11| 2021,4
The room was big| needed alittle updating. The view was amazing & service was good,Jan 11| 2021,4
Difficult with no parking and no help with bags at check in.,Jan 11| 2021,3
I liked the view of the hotel| however it was very outdated. the sink was leaking| there wasn’t any type of service provided. It was a very old fashioned hotel| the location was okay. Overall it wasn’t what I expected. I thought as a Hilton it would be a nicer hotel.,Jan 10| 2021,3
My hotel room was not what I expected| it was small to be a Jr Suite| and filthy| I called for someone to come clean and no one showed up.,Jan 10| 2021,1
Room wasn’t clean tv on wall mount was broken. No accommodations made for covid-19.,Jan 9| 2021,2
Great location| amazing corner room view looking down on Saint Paul's Church and out into NYC. The best part of our 3-day stay - was the view.The double room had a few small issues| nothing that would prevent a future stay. The downfall is no microwave or refrigerator| which is okay considering the location and view for the price. The surrounding food in the area is amazing| Joe's Pizza| the most famous pizza in NYC where the celebrities eat| is only a ten-minute walk. We walked ten minutes at night in the rain for Joe's Pizza| and it was worth every second. "16 Handles"| a gourmet frozen yogurt store with all the toppings is also only a 10-minute walk. The World Trade Center is across the street| I could see the new One World Tower out of our room. I suggest taking the subway to the hotel and parking a few miles away if you stay more than a few days. You can't see NYC in less than 3 days| don't even attempt it| I recommend 5 days! Ask for a floor over 25 to see the amazing view| which is the entire reason you come to NYC! 4.5 star out of 5,Jan 9| 2021,4
This hotel is so centric in downtown Manhattan. View of One world trade center was amazing. Spacious bedroom (king size bed). No housekeeping during pandemic but you can ask for towels in the front desk and throw away your trash and you’re good. Toilet and TV are out dated but we just came to sleep after being in the city all day. Friendly staff. Everything excellent. Would come back.,Jan 9| 2021,5
The view was an amazing view. Definitely sparked my feelings to come back.,Jan 8| 2021,5
The one thing I did not like is that you have to pay for fridge or raider and microwave above above all the experience was really nice the room was clean and nice customer service very friendly,Jan 8| 2021,4
This was a great getaway for a Jersey family. We loved everything about the area and the view was breathtaking! Will deff be back,Jan 8| 2021,5
Staff was friendly and patient| loved the cleanliness and design,Jan 6| 2021,5
Room was dirty | wasn’t there for even 30mins when I checked out but they charged me for the whole night,Jan 5| 2021,1
Love this hotel .,Jan 4| 2021,5
Absolutely terrible all was a lie place wasn’t the place parking wasn’t free,Jan 4| 2021,1
Staff were rude and customer service was pretty bad.,Jan 4| 2021,3
All together my experience was great| it was just cold in the room and the phone wasn’t working.,Jan 4| 2021,4
Nunca limpiaron la habitación en los 8 días que me alojé en el hotel. La nevera no funcionaba.No tienen área para calentar alimentos. Me querían cobrar $35.00 por calentar alimentos.,Jan 2| 2021,3
Location and Staff. BEAUTIFUL HOTEL. Cleanliness .,Jan 1| 2021,5
Great views. Great location| convenient to shopping.,Jan 1| 2021,5
Mini fridge didn’t work. No room service available,Jan 1| 2021,3
Excellent view and comfortable rooms and bathrooms,Dec 31| 2020,5

Omg what I can say about this hotel. Omg it’s so nice and the cleanliness. The staff was very nice and helpful. I would definitely return. Thanks for everything,Dec 30| 2020,5
Very mediocre room. The pictures make the hotel look much more spectacular than in person,Dec 26| 2020,2
Amazing staff. They had upgraded us with a beautiful view and I would definitely stay again when I come back to New York.,Dec 23| 2020,5
no tell to much but ! i like alot all NYC abd the places|food and all that is about food and desert but is a expensive city which is good. thank you,Dec 21| 2020,5
The pillowcase was dirty as well as the blankets had visible dirt as if they weren’t fresh linen. The remote control didn’t work either but overall it was ok,Dec 20| 2020,4
Your basically paying for the view. It’s an older hotel. The window view is amazing. But there isn’t a fridge or even a microwave. Basic lights. Last hotel was half cheaper and it was really nice. Just didn’t have a view of the city. Was expecting a little more for the price.,Dec 20| 2020,4
The view of the wtc memorial was out of this world. Absolutely stunning,Dec 19| 2020,5
The fridge was not working the thermostat was acting up and we were very cold the price for the deposit was very high per night per room. Pool was closed. Price was high for not including food and parking spot,Dec 19| 2020,2
The entire staff was extremely rude and acted as though my being there was an inconvenience to them. All the amenities were closed| which I knew before I booked| however the staff told me an in-room microwave could be requested. When requested| they told me none were available and could not give me an ETA on when to expect one. The bathtub drain was clogged so every time I showered there was sitting water. As the staff was so rude I did not feel comfortable reporting the problem and asking to change rooms. The location and view itself were amazing| and the bed was comfortable however I would never stay here again due to the attitude of the entire staff.,Dec 17| 2020,2
Great hotel right infront from 9/11 Beautiful view super close to Brooklyn bridge. Nice stay at Downtown and close to stores & restaurants.,Dec 16| 2020,5
great stay with a gorgeous view,Dec 16| 2020,5
I didn’t like that they never gave me my deposit back and claimed that it was for cleaning fees but we never had anyone clean our room any of the days that we were there (3) 150$ deposit,Dec 15| 2020,1
The staff was so accommodating and the room was perfect.,Dec 14| 2020,5
The view was great. The hotel and room where not what I imagined. The room had dirty toilet. The carpet was worn down with spots that had been spray painted orange The phone didn’t work. The bed was very noisy. The towels where dirty. The room overall was not kept up to today’s standards.,Dec 14| 2020,3
This is a Hilton| folks.Be ashamed.1. Cars. No area designated for guest dropoff/check in. Was told to just "pull up" on Fulton or Church. That doesn't work. We drove around the block and finally just parking behind some cars in front of garage doors. Ultra inconvenient to have to call| drop off son to ask| and then call again (due to unclear instructions).2. Amenities. Well| don't look for a fridge or microwave in rooms. We had a Jr Suite. The only working ice machine was 9 floors above. They said that all fridges were decommissioned. Looks like a money saving event as less guests? Was told that a fridge could be had for $40. Nice. NY NY. Nickle dime for everything. Lucky no insulin or refrigerated meds.3. Carpets. Rooms are carpeted| but Nasty. No 5 second (even 1 sec) rule here. Torn or fraying. Grundgy.4.  Spare pullout sofa bed. Pretty bad. Thin mattress. No extra pillows (had to take 1 off the king). Not able to make frame flat.5.  Cleanliness. Probably clean. We had no COVID symptoms upon departure. Bathrooms were clean. One towel had what son said looked like blood| but probably wine stains.6.  Parking. Nonexistent. Parked off site via PandaParking (4 blks) as it was cheaper| but still valet| so $ to tip on dropoff and pickup.7.  Customer service. Had better front desk service at Holiday Inn| Comfort Suites| and Springhill. Felt like we were an inconvenience.8. View. Fantastic. Saving grace. Master room had view of "Freedom Tower" and part of 9-11 Memorial.,Dec 12| 2020,3
The Millennium Hilton New York Downtown was unique in terms of it’s location. Being by the WTC and all the local transit stations made it a prime real-estate for anyone visiting.  I was able to get around the city easily. In terms of my actual hotel experience it was subpar. The hotel staff and hotel services you could tell was downsized which was most likely due to covid. I think this negatively affect my stay a little. My friends hotel room wasn’t properly prepared| the bathroom wasn’t cleaned properly. The ice machine on the various floors weren’t functional. I had to travel to the 50th floor to get ice every time. Other than does little instances. The stay was average| I appreciate that I got a nice view from my room. I was very pleased with that. I think I can’t complain my stay was decent.,Dec 12| 2020,4
It says they have parking on site but do not and was not communicated until prompted. No fridge in room. No USB connections in room. Clean nice place. Quick check in and out. Would probably not stay there again.,Dec 12| 2020,3
My boyfriend and I wanted to celebrate our anniversary as a staycation (b/c of Covid) and I was so excited for this hotel because the woman I spoke to over the phone was so kind and accommodating| but when we showed up in person| the man at the front desk barely gave me the time of day. We got a corner room (junior king suite) with awesome windows| but as a whole the room looked old and not that well kept. The couch was stained in multiple places| the window ledge was made of light wood that was severely scratched| the floors didn't seemed vacuumed| and there was only one regular coffee packet and two decaf ones for our morning coffees. They did nothing special for our anniversary (which would have been extra work on their part| but would have made me forget all the other little things). Overall| I was not impressed and I don't plan on staying here again.,Dec 11| 2020,3
Parking was $54 dollars way too much ! It was also my birthday and I had an ice cream cake . Had to throw it out after eating 2 bites because the room didn’t have a fridge and I had to pay $30 if I wanted one . That’s just ridiculous. Room was nice because of the views,Dec 11| 2020,3
Room ok| on the weekend only one elevator works and there were queues to go up to the rooms.,Dec 9| 2020,4
best stay i’ve ever had! staff was extremely friendly! hotel was very clean!!,Dec 9| 2020,5
Great Location | near from everything| astonished view !!!! A must,Dec 8| 2020,5
We stayed for 3 nights and 3 days and everything was all great especially the view inside our room. The only thing that is upsetting we did not get any new towels| complementary coffee and nobody went to our room and clean it. I don't know if it's because of the Pandemic that we are the one who will cleaned and put our garbage out or we should call them and ask for what we need.,Dec 8| 2020,3
The overall experience was great.  The view was amazing and the staff was friendly.  I would most definitely come back and stay at the Hilton millennium,Dec 8| 2020,5
I loved the location. The bed was a little hard and uncomfortable. The bathroom could of been a little nicer.,Dec 8| 2020,4
I didn’t like the fact that COVID is going on and my sheets had dried blood and hair. I would think the sheets would be changed before you are going to issue a room to a person with COVID spreading like wild fires but that was not the case.,Dec 7| 2020,1
Customer services was bad he wasn’t nice,Dec 7| 2020,4
Everything was excellent I like the way I was receiving emails and updates accordingly.,Dec 7| 2020,5
Parking was not free or available. Checked out early but we were still charged an extra night.,Dec 6| 2020,1
Excellent hotel| but the restaurant| bar| and pool were closed because if covid.,Dec 6| 2020,4
Hotel need to upgrade the rooms,Dec 4| 2020,4
The only down fall is off street parking additional costly fee. Everything else. Exceptional.The view is Spectacular. “smiling”,Dec 3| 2020,5
The room was comfortable with a fantastic view...,Dec 2| 2020,5
My stay was great| me and my boyfriend stayed in a junior suite and the view was amazing and the room was very comfortable. Check in was decent but some of the morning staff didn’t acknowledge us walking in or out of the lobby but over all I was satisfied and will now make this hotel my weekend getaway spot so I’ll be going back very soon.,Dec 1| 2020,5
Location| location| location. Spectacular views from my room. Only set back. No refrigerator and no microwave. Not even a vending machine.,Dec 1| 2020,4
The hotel is very nice. I had a city view room on the 54th floor. The view was like a movie. Room is spacious for NYC| comfortable| and nice to be in. Close to almost every train. Parking is an issue as is with most places in the city. We enjoyed our stay.,Nov 30| 2020,5
my room had a beautiful view the place where the hotel is located is spectacular,Nov 30| 2020,5
The view was beautiful and the customer service rep was very accommodating. However| the room could have been cleaner. The refrigerator was disgusting | broken| and not working.,Nov 29| 2020,4
We enjoyed our stay at Millenium Hilton NYC.Hotel was clean| service was fantastic! Room was comfortable| and view was fantastic!,Nov 29| 2020,5
HotelCondition was not expected. No fridge stains all over and used furniture.,Nov 29| 2020,2
Hotel needs an updated ASAP. I stayed before because the view and the commodity to be close to WTC that are a plus for this hotel. But now| the conditions are close to terrible. The carpet looks old and has multiple stains. The shower turned out to be a pool when you take a shower. It needs a drainage clean. Some mold can be seen on shower walls and around the sink. The air conditioning has a clamp sound that can keep you awake for a while. Some outlets have not power. We have to move the small coffee machine to the bathroom for to make it work. We are so glad We have no paid the premium price that usually is this hotel. $300 to $400 because the pandemic. Pros: Staff was professional and helpful. The view still breathtaking and the coffee is good.,Nov 28| 2020,3
The roo,Nov 27| 2020,3
Breathtaking view! We loved it!,Nov 25| 2020,5
Great hotel| quiet| clean|| The Tv was old school| couldn’t put what I wanted on it because of that|| but if you are not there to watch tv||it’s  an awesome hotel| really really great location for the price| I have no complaints.,Nov 25| 2020,5
Don’t like it cuz I had to pay a lot for parking. Would prefer a location that has parking.,Nov 24| 2020,3
Beautiful hotel. Amazing views! Would definitely stay there again!,Nov 24| 2020,5
Okay| so I decided to have a little staycation in the city for the weekend with my little ones. Upon arrival| the hotel is very polished looking| would definitely appeal to business clients/visitors. Front desk staff| was welcoming| quick and efficient. No complaints there. I was placed on the 32nd floor| and my room was close to the elevator. This is where things started to go left for me. 1. This is a non smoking facility| but the elevator and room area REEKED of smoke. And not like oh someone is smoking in their room| more like this is the SMOKING FLOOR. 2. Room| albeit clean is a bit dated. The floors were carpeted| so naturally there were a couple stains. My 5 year old naturally cops a squat on the floor as a kid| and I’m like ehh ehh| don’t sit don’t sit! 3. No fridge... 4. Bathroom| again clean| but dated. And I noticed there was a leak from the pipe when you turn on the cold water. I remember washing my sons face and I’m like how the hell did the floor get so wet?5. There’s no room service until 3 days into your stay in regards to Covid restrictions. Now I’m not the sharpest tool in the shed| but wouldn’t the pandemic ramp UP the cleaning??? I digress. 6. I must have been placed on the “popping” floor because there was quite a bit of traffic at night. Not the WORST| but I’m having a staycation| so I wanted to chill.7. I had to print a document for work| so I went to the business center| where there were 3 computer stations. 1 pc and 2 Macs| TBC,Nov 23| 2020,2
Pillows are incredibly soft| rooms are very spacious  which is a huge plus with a nice view for a good price. Only complaint are the bath towels which are really dry and triggered my eczema but that’s a personal complaint probably. Bathrooms are clean too. 5/5 can’t wait to come back post-pandemic.,Nov 23| 2020,5
I really enjoyed my stay ! The staff was wonderful and always very helpful! Loved my room view!,Nov 23| 2020,5
I like the entrance| the staff in the lobby| I liked the view from the room that I was in. They just need to do a little effort in cleaning the rooms| I mean I can only talk about the room that I was in| a little effort in the cleaning. After that everything was fine| except that with COVID-19 we are basically have a limit in using the amenties,Nov 23| 2020,5
I reserved the deluxe king room with the city view however I do not understand what was the deluxe part about it. There was no refrigerator inside the room and it was smaller than I would have expected. Overall it was a decent clean room.,Nov 22| 2020,4
The stay was amazing I just feltThey should of never charged sooo much as if we was able to use the amenities we was not able to use anything then charged for microwave didn’t have a refrigerator but the stay was very comfortable and the staff are very professional,Nov 22| 2020,5
The hotel had no parking,Nov 22| 2020,1
There’s no control on the facility| staff horrible customer service from some of them not all of them and not happy with my room at all,Nov 22| 2020,1
Valet parking isn’t available on premise any more according to front desk staff not polite at all for visitors. Spend about an hour looking for parking. No amenities for visitors and the rooms are not fully clean drawers had hair in them. Very nice location but definitely will never stay here again.,Nov 22| 2020,3
Is hotel. But have many restrictions by pandemic COVID 19,Nov 21| 2020,2
Couches in rooms was filthy| you could see the dirt on them. Carpets was filthy as well| service at check in was terrible| front desk service was terrible!,Nov 19| 2020,1
First room that I checked into had a rug in the bathroom with a huge stain on it. Looked very dirty. My room was changed as soon as I mentioned it. Next room had great views however the shower stopped up everytime I toom a shower and the toilet made a noise every 30 mins. Otherwise room was cool. Pool and and gym not open. Not a bad stay but not the best,Nov 17| 2020,3
We stayed for 1 night| me and my husband were playing a board game. Passed by a really funny card and we were laughing. Couple minutes pass by security is at the front door about a noise complaint from the rooms next door. Security told us if we get another complaint they will evict us.They weren’t willing to hear us out or believe us. Other then that the room was very clean. Bathroom smelled a little moldy and I believe it’s because the bathrooms have no air vents. Hotel walls are pretty thin.,Nov 17| 2020,1
Amazing location however the room are not that wow . Room should be more clean my was really dusty.,Nov 17| 2020,3
Our room wasnt very clean. There was a used washcloth in the bathroom and the couch was dirty. The bed was uncomfortable and there was stains on the dressers. The staff could've been way more friendly and welcoming. The rooms are smaller than what it appears to be online. I booked a suite and it was small. The only nice things about this hotel is the view and how close it is to Brooklyn. I'm never booking another stay here again.,Nov 17| 2020,2
The room was just OK. honestly I expected it to be more luxury and to at least have a small refrigerator or something. It was just a small room with the basic stuff. The only thing I loved was the view. It had such an amazing and breathtaking city view! The room wasn’t cleaned properly as I found a pair of glasses in my room right next to my bed| the tub had a bunch of pubic hair from previous guest and one of the bath towels had a stain. The room had dust in every corner which indicates that it was not cleaned properly just like a touch up but not like a real check out cleaning. I expected more from a Hilton room but it was OK anyways we wanted to be more out than inside the room. I can’t say much about the facilities since everything was closed due to COVID like the pool| we only used the room and the ice machine.,Nov 16| 2020,3
I wasnt aware that I would have to find street parking or pay 110 for every nignt the car was parked. I initially booked for two nights but i didnt want to spent more money for parking. Plus basic anemities were unavailable. Worst hotel experience!!,Nov 16| 2020,1
The hotel was very nice and clean that's the most important thing because of COVID 19 you want to stay a hotel that makes sure thing are clean and the lining are washed well.,Nov 16| 2020,4
The staff was amazing.  The location is amazing.  Our room had a view of St. Paul’s| where George Washington prayed. The oculus and the 9/11 memorial are right outside the hotel.  Thank you so much for a remarkable trip.,Nov 16| 2020,5
My room wasn’t cleaned the whole time i was there. I had to clean myself and had a big trash bag just sitting in my room for days.,Nov 16| 2020,1
The experience was great! The room did have a couple of flaws like water mark stains on the curtains and if it's sunny you can see alot of dust on the outside windows but other than that it was great,Nov 15| 2020,5
My stay was amazing...the staff took great care of me. I work in the medical field and needed the TLC which they provided.,Nov 14| 2020,5
My stay was ok. The only problem was the shower wasn’t clean and the,Nov 14| 2020,4
We loved the stay| the view was beautiful and the room was very clean.,Nov 14| 2020,5
Everything was amazing. The room was spacious and very clean. The water was very hot. It was overall a wonderful hotel. Heads up| If you are a tourist and dont know much about parking downtown| just know that the hotel doesnt have parking available at the moment so you have to spend an additional $50 per night to park your car in a parking garage.,Nov 13| 2020,5
The hotel was very clean| the king room had a beautiful view of the skyline and the service was quick. Overall a great place. Would definitely recommend.,Nov 13| 2020,5
Front desk need to be trained and how to welcome and treat guests,Nov 13| 2020,3
IT was great!,Nov 13| 2020,5
Honestly everything was great. Very clean| beautiful view| and great location. Only thing I would suggest is the hotel investing in more comfortable pillows.,Nov 10| 2020,5
This was a horrible experience. There was not a refrigerator in the room or a microwave. There was no valet parking. Staff was not friendly and not accommodating. The room was freezing.,Nov 9| 2020,2
Was beautiful only complaint that there is no fridge in the room so strange,Nov 9| 2020,5
It’s was my birthday. My husband and spent one night here the location was Kusic with a perfect New York city view of Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan Bridge..Our restaurant was walking distance from this location so that was a plus for me. The room was just what we needed for the night clean spacious and comfortable. The shower was a little bit tricky a little bit too modern  The flooring were flat so The entire bathroom was wet.,Nov 9| 2020,4
I love this hotel.  The front desk clerks are very helpful in assisting me with various needs.  The room is very modern| clean| and most importantly| extremely comfortable.  This is one of my top hotel choices when I spend the weekend in the city,Nov 8| 2020,5
I had a wonderful experience and would definitely book again!!,Nov 7| 2020,5
No fridge working or microwave ...,Nov 6| 2020,4
everything was amazing| the view was spectacular| will stay here again,Nov 6| 2020,5
Self parking was extremely difficult to get to| there was no valet parking. Check in was dreadfully slow. My room had a gorgeous view though.,Nov 6| 2020,2
it was an amazing experience. One of my favorite hotels in NYC,Nov 6| 2020,5
The view of the room was of right in front of the Freedom Tower. It was fantastic!,Nov 5| 2020,5
Besides the woman who was nasty when I called to ask about check-out time| the stay was great. I had the city view room and I had an incredible view of the trade center and the Hudson River and the price wasn’t bad at all. The room could use some updating but it was perfectly clean and well kept. I’ve stayed in many hotels in my life and this one was definitely one of the coolest,Nov 5| 2020,5
Great hotel with a fantastic view. Confortable and good service.,Nov 5| 2020,5
I was giving false information 2 times and was forced to come out of pocket an extra $110Because of it. I was not accommodated in anyway. I was told there was nothing they could do because i booked through a third party. Which I felt was very unprofessional regardless to how I booked I should have been treated like any other guest.,Nov 4| 2020,1
The views from the 45th floor were breathtaking!! Customer service at hotel was immaculate. The lady who helped us check in suggested a really good Deli across the way and it was delicious!,Nov 4| 2020,5
Basically the Building had not individual heat control and I wish I would’ve known this before. It was freezing the whole time. We had to run the hot shower to get some heat in the room! The view was nice| bed was comfortable but it was too cold to be comfortable overall.,Nov 3| 2020,2
It was a great stay. I loved the view from my room.,Nov 2| 2020,5
The Guy at check in was really nasty. did not let us enter because ONE of us had no Physical Id. My partner had his and I had on my phone. I had nowhere to stay for the night.was really bad.,Nov 2| 2020,1
Old building with adequate upgrades. Nice. Worth the cost.,Nov 2| 2020,5
They charged an additional 100.00 for leaving  a few rose petals on the bed. Unbelievable. Customer service was terrible as well. Wouldn’t recommend!!,Nov 2| 2020,1
Good location and property| but furniture felt a bit old and dingy.,Nov 2| 2020,4
Beautiful room| with a gorgeous city view like we requested.,Nov 2| 2020,5
I absolutely love this hotel.  I spend one night a week in NYC and the Millennium is my preferred hotel| hands down!,Nov 2| 2020,5
I had to switch my room 3 times due to the room being dirty specifically the bathroom. The rooms weren’t updated and the curtains and chair cushion were stained. Never staying there again. On Expedia it stated there was valet but there actually wasn’t and we had to find street parking in the middle of midtown,Nov 2| 2020,1
My second stay at the hotel. Always nice check in service and great Help n with concierge. We love it.,Nov 2| 2020,5
The view is amazing| and staff members are very friendly.,Nov 2| 2020,5
My room was on the 43rd floor| west side of building| overlooking the river| Jersey City| the Oculus| the WTC| including its memorial park| and dozens of other skyscrapers.  And what a view!  No obstructions| continuously changing with time of day and weather.  I enjoyed the view so much I even left my curtains open to see it when I rolled over at night.  (Views on the east side of the building are good if you’re high enough| but not spectacular.)  The 911 museum is in spitting distance from the hotel| so bad weather is not a factor if the museum’s the object of your trip.  My room itself is well designed and appointed| if beginning to show its age.  (They’re losing the battle against mildew in the shower; a handle was missing on the chest of drawers; a burned-out light was not replaced as requested.)  There’s always a long line for check-in at check-in timed (3 pm) and all the services are closed due to covid (restaurant| pool| etc.)| but there’s coffee/tea in the room.  Bottom line:  Good value for money at this time| in spite of shortcomings.,Nov 1| 2020,4
hotel was okay - view was great! we weren’t greeted upon arrival just uncomfortably stared at. the hotel overall is not updated or modernized so old stained carpet| old tvs without wifi capabilities...tvs had salt and pepper clarity. the room we were placed in was musty smelling and the bed size was a queen when we had reserved a king. the second night we requested a change in room and the room was better but worse tv issues in that room.,Oct 31| 2020,3
great all aroundconveniant to 9/11 memorialbeautiful room,Oct 30| 2020,5
I was very disappointed The room was extremely cold the window was left open and I could not close maintenance came they close the window but there still was no heat the carpet was dirty the room was antiquated old there was a garbage bag with a dirty face mass stuck in the smoke detector the staff was nice but I couldn’t understand why I didn’t have any heat could not stay there change hotels,Oct 30| 2020,1
Its my second time in this hotel i love the view but the manager when i was checking in wasnt that nice and the housekeeping policy is silly for 6 nights 1 time cleaning!!,Oct 28| 2020,4
The beds was horrible n small n had metal that kept hurting me due to hanging out frames ! The bathroom paint job was horrible every time I steamed  the room was moved due to a cheap tv,Oct 27| 2020,3
Walking into the building the Lobby looked very nice and the front desk was courteous| however| unfortunately all that got overlooked by the smell of vomit that hit us upon entering our room. Since it was only in our living room area and not where our bed was| we didn’t complain. To use the coffeemaker I had to pull out an entire dresser to find a socket to plug the coffeemaker into. This did not feel like a four star hotel and I would not recommend a stay here. I am pretty easy going| but unfortunately our stay was substantially subpar that I feel compelled to leave this review. I understand given the circumstances with the pandemic. This hotel is directly across the street from the World Trade Center and 911 Memorial so that was great.,Oct 27| 2020,2
My girlfriend & I stayed for 2 nights| loved the view in our suite literally was the best part. Will stay again,Oct 27| 2020,3
The area was nice and the view was perfect  check in was fast the only complaint the blankets wasnt clean and thefe was too much hair on both covers,Oct 26| 2020,3
View was great. Location was great| all the subways are either right in front of the building or a block away. However| walls are very thin. We can here the conversations people are having next door. And the telephone in the room was not working so we couldn’t get a hold of the front desk and housekeeping.,Oct 26| 2020,4
My air conditioner was leaking my floor was wet in the bathroom| remote to tv wasn’t working| towels and rags wasn’t really cleaned good| the room was not cleaned well| no fridge | one bathroom was told I was getting breakfast but everything was closed and paid for the breakfast already,Oct 26| 2020,3
Simply the best. Fell in love with NYC all over again.,Oct 26| 2020,5
Well first if I had a Junior suite I should’ve had a Refrigerator Microwave And two bathrooms in my suite  because on the website that’s what it says for a Junior suite... I found used condoms in my suite and the sheets and blanket had stains on it,Oct 26| 2020,4
It was directly across from WTC. So location was nice. The front desk staff are somewhat unfriendly and show a lack of professional courtesy. But even that doesn’t bother me to much. The bathtub kept backing up| but was eventually fixed. But what I found disgusting were sample shampoo and body lotions had tiny black hairs all on the inside cap. For some reason that made me gag to think they aren’t replaced after each guest.,Oct 26| 2020,2
Hotel is outdated!! No Refridgerator it was convenient for the nite but won’t stay again.,Oct 26| 2020,3
Fantastic location. Right across the street from transportation hub and mall (The Oculus). One street over from the 9/11 memorial. Plenty of things to do and places to eat. Lots to see. The view is amazing. Unfortunately| due to COVID| amenities were closed at the hotel including the parking garage but we were lucky enough to find a garage one street over for the same price we would have paid to park at the hotel. Property was very clean. WILL DEFINITELY BOOK AGAIN.,Oct 26| 2020,5
For the chain this hotel is apart of and the location,Oct 26| 2020,2
Amazing hotel great stay! Staff was friendly. Doorman was rude but I didn’t let that ruin my stay everything else was great.,Oct 25| 2020,5
The room was nice but there was a Stain on my bed when i came in the room and the ice machine was not working,Oct 25| 2020,4
The lobby and external parts of the building are nice and clean. The interior rooms and floors are in poor condition. The bedding was dirty (see pic). I did ask for and quickly receive a room change.,Oct 25| 2020,3
I trusted the Hilton brand and booked a week at the Hilton Millenium Downtown for a business trip and oh boy. The hotel facilities are quite old and the first room they provided still had food and trash from the last person that stayed in the room. Second room had a really dirty carpet and the sofa had numerous nasty stains. The third one had an issue with the A/C and it wasn’t cooling down the room at all. Fourth room was at last acceptable but still had stains in the floor carpet and sofa. I wanted to get my money back so that I could move to a different hotel but they said they don’t do that so I has to stay the duration of my business trip in that room. Terrible experience. Don’t stay here. You’ve been warned!,Oct 25| 2020,1
Wretched.  Disappointing.  A sign of these times.   What was once one of my favorite hotels in the city has been transformed into a third rate facility.   Trash in hallways.  No care for experience of other guests.   For decades| this hotel has been an oasis for business travelers.  No longer.   Dirty carpets.  Cigarette smells.   Don’t stay here.   After pointing out McDonalds trash in the hallways to a manager| three hours later| after he walked by it| it was still there.   Decay starts at the top.,Oct 25| 2020,1
We came in and there was leftover food from other guest in the refrigerator. Shower leaked water everywhere and same with sink. No housekeeping. It was very disappointing.,Oct 25| 2020,3
Room was not ready even though we arrived at regular checkin time.,Oct 25| 2020,1
Dirty old room. Nice view. Needs A major overhaul.,Oct 24| 2020,2
solid bed| Amazing view of park Row and in the distance over the buildings| Manhattan Bridge. ask tor a room facing east| unless you want to look at the world trade center and get in your feelings. This is an older hotel| there is a Power strip for your chargeables because when the Millenium was new| people only had rotary phones and so only one outlet in the room. still a great time and space for the $$$,Oct 24| 2020,4
The TV is the worst I’ve ever seen in a hotel since 2010,Oct 24| 2020,3
Is the beautiful place| it’s recomendable for reserved this hotel,Oct 24| 2020,5
Pros and cons about this hotel. Super Pro is the location. Very convenient to subway and lots of shopping and food. Another pro is i had an excellent view. The room itself| however| quality wise does not live up to the photos. My room smelled of smoke even though it was non smoking. The remote was broken. The tv had just few channels. There was coffee (or something else) splattered all over the bathroom door. Room was clean “enough” but definitely didn’t look as new as the photos.,Oct 23| 2020,4
The view was amazing & the room was super clean. I would definitely book again,Oct 22| 2020,5
My room doesn’t have microwave and fridge. The bar is closed.,Oct 22| 2020,4
EXCELLENT,Oct 21| 2020,5
It was okay. None much to really do,Oct 21| 2020,1
I didn’t really like the toilet| it was to low For a normal person to sit very uncomfortable and very hard to get up or down . I would say it could be unsafe as well .,Oct 21| 2020,5
Horrible hotel!!! Disrespectful staff!!! Do not ever stay at the hotel!,Oct 21| 2020,1
The lobby was presented well.  The room was disappointingly worn.  A/C rattled all night and I was unable to sleep.,Oct 21| 2020,2
Jr Suite was spacious with great view of Freedom Tower and WTC. Security staff at lobby were the most obnoxious and disrespectful| Wouldn’t even allow folks to sit at the lobby or take a phone call. Lady at business center was very nice.,Oct 21| 2020,2
I reserved a smoke free room| however| when I checked in| the room that I was designated to smelt like pure marijuana. I requested to be switched to another room; the new room smelt musty and unclean. At that point I just settled as I was extremely exhausted and needed to rest. The hotel has changed. This used to be my to go to hotel whenever I was in NYC for business trips. Totally disappointed.,Oct 21| 2020,2
Didn’t clean our rooms you have to request it a day before,Oct 20| 2020,4
Beautiful view from my room| very close to the attractions places ano the train station. In general the Hotel is very pretty. The restaurant and the bar at the hotel was closed doto  Covid-19.,Oct 20| 2020,4
It was in a beautiful location with plenty of restaurants nearby,Oct 20| 2020,5
I was disappointed with the fact that the refrigerator in the room wasn’t working and when I asked at the front desk they told me “all the refrigerators / mini bars in the building  had been disabled| however they offered to give us one for an additional $35 per night. How disgusting! Especially since we were just switching from the Hilton millennium not too far away at the UN plaza (so much better| go there instead if you’re reading this). We also paid for breakfast and were told on check in that there was no breakfast. This place is a joke| and I’m saying this as a Hilton Honors member| the view is amazing but the service is trash!,Oct 19| 2020,3
Beautiful property and very well located. Our room had an amazing view and I cant wait to go back!,Oct 19| 2020,5
The location of the hotel was great. There’s no complaints there. You’re literally in the middle of everything. However| I’ve never stayed at a hotel that doesn’t provide a fridge or microwave. None in the rooms or lobby. That’s just ridiculous. We had no where to store our drinks and no where to warm up food we bought. It was very inconvenient. And also to charge $50 deposit per day and not have any of the amenities come with it is just a rip off. I understand we’re still in the middle of a pandemic but what does that have to do with not having a fridge or microwave in the rooms. You cared more about taking those items out than your housekeepers doing their job to ensure a clean and safe environment.  The 4 days and 3 nights I was there no one cleaned or changed our sheets.,Oct 19| 2020,3
The staff was very rude| the room was very dusty| the walls are not soundproofed at all and the guests next-door were very load to late hours of the night.Was a horrible experience and definitely don't recommend this hotel.,Oct 19| 2020,1
Great customer service and a beautiful view. The King Suite room could use an update honestly for the price you pay. The room seems outdated and bland. But overall was a great experience. I would recommend staying there.,Oct 19| 2020,5
The hotel overall was lovely . But my room was dusty in some areas and smelled like cigarette smoke it was very overwhelming. I lit a candle and had air freshener but nothing worked . It was disappointing because it’s a non smoking hotel and I’m asthmatic. I had my own Clorox wipes so I handled the dust but . It made me question the cleaning that is done to the room. The view was amazing and the atmosphere was peaceful . So i would say 7.5/10,Oct 19| 2020,5
The view was amazing and so was the room size/space. Only negatives were we had a fridge that smelled really bad I don’t know if it was working or not. The second is the sheets had an odor so they definitely need to add more laundry detergent when they do laundry or something,Oct 19| 2020,5
Had to pay extra 65$ a night for parking smdh. Staffs was kinda busy don’t even want to help ya even though ain’t no one there,Oct 19| 2020,2
The room wasn’t clean properly the a.c unit made so much noise but was not blowing any air. The view was nice| but nothing it the room worked properly. No fridge,Oct 19| 2020,3
No fridge| and no internet service.  The room was ok.,Oct 18| 2020,4
Loved my stay for a couple staycation. But room smelled like smoke on a non smoking floor. And some of the outlets in the room didn’t work. And walls were quite thin.,Oct 18| 2020,4
Good location| staff was nice| fridge didn’t work| thermostat didn’t seem to work well (quite cold in the room)| not a whole lot of power outlets conveniently located in the room. Overall safe and quiet place to sleep but no frills,Oct 18| 2020,3
Due to COVID-19 there were no amenities and the parking garage was closed. It would have been very helpful to have known ahead of time about the parking garage. That may have been a determining factor in choosing the hotel. We had to walk several blocks with luggage to the alternate garage| and my husband has a leg injury. On a positive note - the hotel was clean and the location is great.,Oct 18| 2020,4
The hotel is in a good location to walk to the seaport| piers and the river walk. Unfortunately| it needs to be updated - the furniture is scratched| carpets are stained etc. There are also no amenities open due to COVID and you have to request a fridge and/or microwave. On the plus side| the staff is very accomodating and friendly.,Oct 18| 2020,3
The concierge was extra helpful and polite. The best service.  The cleaning lady was cheerful and super nice.,Oct 18| 2020,4
Do not stay here. Staff are extremely rude| they won’t hold your luggage past four and they won’t allow you to use the restroom downstairs.,Oct 18| 2020,2
The hotel is beautiful and the price was great for a nice couples night out BUT the water was ice cold in the morning and we weren’t able to shower. Mentioned it upon checkout and it didn’t seem to phase the person at the front desk. Not even an apology offered for the inconvenience. Customer service is such a thing of the past these days....///,Oct 18| 2020,4
Great stay. Staff was amazing. Room was well cleaned and comfy. However| the parking is very horrible. If your reservation doesn't come with parking they will not validate your parking. Other from that my stay was great.,Oct 17| 2020,5
The room was great in size and space but everything else was just okay.,Oct 17| 2020,5
The view was the best part of the stay| the only thing to say about the stay the is the bathroom was not sparkling clean,Oct 16| 2020,4
The refrigerator in our room is not working. And the AC vent is dirty. Upon checking in| the staff wasn’t nice in greeting us. But I think this is just how it is in NYC. We are from west coast| and we all feel people aren’t too nice in NYC.,Oct 16| 2020,2
We booked for one night but ended up leaving early. The phone in the room wasn’t working and the noise level was a bit crazy from the room next door| it was almost as though our neighbors were in the room with us. Beautiful view| we appreciated that but the walls are paper thin...Because we are in NY at least once a month| we will probably stay there again| hopefully next time it’s better.,Oct 15| 2020,4
Nice staff and room,Oct 14| 2020,5
All was fine - check in staff was competent. Room was good|  view of the Oculus and the Freedom Tower were amazing.  Covid had the streets fairly empty and the hotel amenities not in service. Biggest  complaint was the straight out of the 90's TV in room was abysmal with horrible reception. Otherwise all was above average.,Oct 14| 2020,4
Our room had amazing views of One World Trade aka The Freedom tower| One of the 9/11 memorial pools and the New Oculus and it was clean a bit small for it to be a king room but it was ok. The only complaint was that there was no hot water 2x out of the 3 days we stayed at the wrong time especially the day of check out when I wanted to shower before I left. The phones in the room were not working cause they wasnt charging correctly we couldnt get ours to work. The ice machines are not turned on| on every floor so you can only get ice from the designated floors in which a sign on the machine will tell you where to go. If you want to bypass the hotel tv I was able to hook up my firestick and watch my shows just paid for the premium wifi for streaming purposes $5.00 a day used it for 2 days. Other than the amenities not being available due to Covid. I would definitely book again. Hopefully the next time the hot water issue would be corrected.  I would also ask for my next room to not be so near the elevators and maybe next views of the Brooklyn and Mahattan bridges.,Oct 13| 2020,4
The location of this hotel is great however the rooms where a little dirty especially among a pandemic. The ice machines where not working on every floor they don’t have vending machines in case you need to buy water or something to drink.,Oct 13| 2020,3
The fridge in every room has been taken out of service| over 30 floors and only one ice machine had a few chunks of ice making inconvenient for everyone in the entire hotel.,Oct 13| 2020,3
The hotel was fine. The room was basic and could use updating.,Oct 13| 2020,3
The resturant is closed.. the fridge doesn’t work... the tv was on and off had to call to get it fix... card didn’t work and there was no house keeping.. horrible experience... never again,Oct 13| 2020,1
Great experience and the real asset to this hotel is the amazing view to the World Trade Center,Oct 13| 2020,5
The room that they gave us the lights didn’t work also the bathroom door don’t close we ask for another room then the room was dirty no wifi the next day they clean up our room and they took one of our shopping bags.,Oct 12| 2020,1
There was no parking at all. I paid 54 a night and another 54 another night so about 108 and also had a 100 deposit i had no idea about so if i wouldn't of had the money i would be screwed,Oct 12| 2020,3
Beautiful hotel| room was clean and tidy. Loved everything,Oct 12| 2020,5
Very clean and comfy stay with quick and courteous check in. Nice view of the city,Oct 11| 2020,5
Located in a nice area| rooms were clean and the front desk personnel were nice,Oct 11| 2020,5
The hotel room was beautiful. Gorgeous view. Hotel was very busy so there was a line for check in. Also the elevator allows 2 people at a time| COVID related| which caused a long line for the elevator as well.,Oct 11| 2020,5
Staff is rude and uptight| judgy and it seems like they hate working there. Not very helpful when asking questions and seemed annoyed about everything. The hotel was great and comfy though and the view was perfect!,Oct 10| 2020,5
Great experience| clean and enjoyable!,Oct 9| 2020,5
Room had human hair in bathroom Lights wasnt working tv remote wasnt working untill they replaced it Bad experience all over especially for junior suits Wont stay again,Oct 9| 2020,1
The room was disgusting. I took photos and felt extremley uncomfortable my whole stay. Even the shower water had a funky smell to it.,Oct 9| 2020,2
No parking available at this facility| the desk agent gave us the parking garage address which was 4 blocks away we paid $70 for per night :/ the agent that helped us was not the friendliest.  Facility was clean rooms where nice.  Just wish I knew that no parking was available at this Hilton.,Oct 7| 2020,3
No tienen estacionamiento| tuvimos que caminar 12 min desde el estacionamiento que nos recomendaron($89 diario) hasta el hotel| las habitaciones no contaban con la nevera que ofrecen tampoco el microondas y la bañera de hidromasaje para obtener hielo tuvimos que subir hasta el piso 35 y el 50 que era donde único servía la máquina pero apresar de todo disfruté mi viaje a Manhattan,Oct 6| 2020,3
Our stay was amazing. During check in the first room that was assigned to us the tv was very staticky and very outdated so we decided to go back down and request a new room. The gentleman that accommodated us was very helpful and moved us to a different room with no problems. Overall the hotel was clean| the view was nice and it was a nice little getaway.,Oct 6| 2020,4
Everything was fine| only the wifi didn’t work. Such a great experience,Oct 6| 2020,5
The view was awesome but the room and bathroom were dated no USB ports Bathroom is due for remodel.No other amenities due to Covid,Oct 6| 2020,4
When I reserved it said free parking.  When I checked in the hotel said they don’t have parking. It is so wrong you guys can’t update information on websites. I ended spending so much on parking spot| not cool.,Oct 5| 2020,2
It was terrible i kept hearing noises all night and day i ask the hotel manager wat was it and they said people were working on the elevator all lies then the long line to get on the elevator they had no parking u had to park a block away,Oct 5| 2020,1
The view from the room was amazing. However| the cleanliness of the room was not. We found an acrylic nail by the bed and the sheets had a hole in them. I was nervous to even sleep in the bed. Other than that| it was a pretty regular stay!,Oct 5| 2020,4
Some channels weren’t working and the ac didn’t cool the room down.,Oct 5| 2020,3
I absolutely loved the view from my room; looking out to see the 9/11 Memorial and One World Trade Center were magnificent sites to see both during the day and in the early evening| as the sun went down.There were some problems with the room itself (the mini-fridge was broken| and the door knob on the bathroom door was broken and loose as well).  Other than that| the room was a fairly nice place to stay| and it was right next to subway entrances that lead uptown and downtown| so it was very convenient for getting around the city!,Oct 5| 2020,4
Hotel was dirty when I got there. They didn’t clean it when they said they would. It was extremely loud. Smelled like smoke. Completely unacceptable especially during COVID when the hotel is practically empty. Very disappointed.,Oct 5| 2020,1
Great views| kind service. Amenities closed for covid.,Oct 5| 2020,5
The room was spacious and very comfortable with great location,Oct 4| 2020,4
Very disappointed with staff and their customer service. The room was not cleaned on time and when you for the room to be clean no one available. There is some days that room does not get clean at all until the next day. I did make a request for a microwave from my second day and never received one at all till checked out.,Oct 4| 2020,2
It’s a nice hotel in a very good location| due to COVID 19 there was almost no service at the hotel| the pool was closed and so was the gym| but it’s understandable. The room was big and the view was amazing| very comfortable bed and big screen tv with lots of channels. The furniture is a little dated and there are stains on the carpet.The mini bar wasn’t working and I was told that it was disconnected because of the pandemic| but since I stayed for a week they brought me a little fridge and it was very helpful. Overall I was pleased and the view was breathtaking| the freedom tower right outside the window.,Oct 4| 2020,4
Great facility with an amazing view over the Oculus and the skyscrapers of World Trade Center. Very clean.,Oct 4| 2020,5
A lot of the amenities they offer and the free parking was not the case when arrived all hotel services were closed and that should have been stated prior to booking to notifying guest that free breakfast and other services promised weren’t going to be provided. However the room and view was beautiful bathroom needed cleaning but I was able to clean that up myself,Oct 4| 2020,3
Nothing is available and they fail to mention ituntil you have already booked your room. Staff is not at all friendly or courteous. Better off going somewhere else to have your stay.,Oct 2| 2020,1
There was a nail in the carpet by the bed the cut me. Although the view was great on the 50 floor the room service took about an hour and a half to bring two robes,Oct 1| 2020,3
great hotel in an incredible location!  Multiple subway stops with in a block and the PATH trains stop right out front. Only complaint is that the walls are a little thin and so there is some noise. Nothing terrible. And I will stay here again but it was there. Management was good about talking to particularly noisy rooms. Which I appreciated.,Oct 1| 2020,4
Chargingn me 250. For already damaged room,Oct 1| 2020,1
The pictures do not look so much like the room. It’s presented as grand and beautiful but once you get out of the elevator you are stunned by mediocrity.,Sep 30| 2020,3
the room was not very clean.  The fridge was broken| the TV control too.  various dirty places.  In 6 days there was not a single house keeping.  According to Hilton| due to covid policies| you must request it yourself in advance| even if you spend a month in the Hotel and even if the garbage leaves the door. In this particular hotel the only thing you have access to is your room| all other areas of it were closed by Covid.,Sep 30| 2020,2
Wasn't sure if the room was ever cleaned from the previous guest stay. There was a used towel on the bathroom sink counter and there were used water bottles in the refrigerator. The refrigerator was plugged in but was not cold at all.,Sep 30| 2020,4
The check in process was horrible.... There were over 10 guests on line and it took a good 20minutes just to get to the front of the line.  there were only two associates working on a clearly busy Friday evening.,Sep 29| 2020,3
The Room was poor standard and not what I expected Based on what I expected from a hotel of there standard. I was Placed in a room that was out dated the tv had lines in it. So I was Basically stuck in an out dated room with an inoperable tv. Just really disappointed.,Sep 29| 2020,1
We had a amazing time first time with my lovers in a suite. Will definitely do this again. The View from the top is amazing.,Sep 29| 2020,5
The only good thing about this hotel is its location. However its cleanliness is totally unacceptable. Dirty rooms dirty bathrooms dirty towels.... Really sorry for what they have....,Sep 29| 2020,2
Wonderful stay and awesome views,Sep 29| 2020,5
Upon arriving to our FIRST room| we walked in to a cracked tv screen and old bed linen sitting on the chair. It didn’t look as if the room was cleared or checked before being assigned to us. Although the room was quickly swapped out for us and the tv in our second room wasn’t cracked| we still weren’t impressed. The fridge in the second room was not on and all shelving from the fridge was stored in the top drawer of the dresser. There was also still left over hair on the floor from the prior guests or whoever “cleaned” the room before we checked in. In addition| the garbage on our floor was overflowing when we checked in and was not taken out until we checked out... 2 days later. Overall| didn’t reach standards of cleanliness and we won’t be back.,Sep 28| 2020,2
Very clean | spacious and friendly check in...,Sep 28| 2020,5
I loved the view from the 52nd floor and corner room.,Sep 28| 2020,2
Room was small| bed made my skin itch| water from the shower all over the bathroom| refrigerator wasn’t working,Sep 28| 2020,2
Hotel is outdated and rooms have foundation problems.,Sep 28| 2020,1
Great place to stay customer service was awesome pleasant,Sep 28| 2020,5
I liked the view from our 2nd room because the 1st room didn't have quite a few things  working properly. The front desk was quick to fix everything by letting us stay in another room free of charge. If you book definitely ask for a room with a corner view so you can see the view of Manhattan better,Sep 28| 2020,4
Had some issues with check in| front desk was not willing to help| besides that had a good experience in overall.,Sep 28| 2020,4
The views are spectacular. Room is nicely appointed and the king size bed is a real luxury in nyc.,Sep 27| 2020,5
GREAT!!! AMAZING AND A GREAT PLACE TO STAY AND GREAT LOCATION,Sep 27| 2020,5
Check in was a breeze and staff is friendly. View is beautiful from the 46th floor. However the room had a strange smell went to the store and purchased air freshener to fix it.,Sep 27| 2020,4
The room was horrible and it smelled horrible. There was no service and the fridge was broken.,Sep 27| 2020,1
The hotel is very nice & the room was very comfortable.   We did| however| have a few issues.    After checking in rather late & taking all of our stuff to our room| the room we were given reeked of smoke.     I was very disappointed as I was tired & this is a 4 star hotel.   We had to go back to the front  desk & request another room|     Our 2nd room was very nice.     After settling in| I had to go find parking as there is no valet parking & the hotel’s garage is closed.    The front desk clerk told us of a parking garage.    After driving a few blocks| I realized it was just too far away!   I had to pull over & google another lot.     It was 8 blocks from the hotel.    I found out that the concierge could not store our bags the next day from 8:00-6:00 because they only allowed bags to be stored after check-out from 9:00-4:00.     The next morning my daughter & I had to walk 8 blocks lugging our things to our vehicle to store until we left the city.     We didn’t have time to find a cab.   We discovered a parking garage 2 blocks from the hotel that the front desk clerk did not tell us about.    We were so disappointed.      The hotel is very clean & quite nice.   However| due to COVID services are limited.    Staff needs to direct guests to the closet parking garage as there are no valet services.    It was so disappointing to be sent so far from the hotel.     Overall| the hotel is clean and in a great location.    However| customer service could have been much better.,Sep 26| 2020,3
Nice stay! Would definitely recommend,Sep 26| 2020,5
gud,Sep 25| 2020,5
The refrigerator was broken| carpets dirty| tv was not clear| passing lot closed and had to pay $120 for parking for 2 days...did not get compt,Sep 25| 2020,2
Excellent location However very poor management and managers for the night and the day .  Not friendly and do not care about customers complaints.  Rooms are very noisy from the elevators constantly| no matter where you live . Front desk phone was not working from the hotel room. If you have problems| you need to get up at midnight and go to front desk where you will see a cold faces.  The noises from groups of people who checked in late.  They talked loudly in the hallway| knocking doors To each other. They felt like nobody but themselves on the floor.  Front desk did not stop them when we were back to floor to change the room. We got little sleep overnight. We met the manager in the morning and complained. He seemed They have had known the noises from people and the elevators . He kindly offered no charge . However our trip was ruined by the nightmare.,Sep 25| 2020,1
The room is very clean and well put together as well as those that work,Sep 24| 2020,5
The city view of the World Trade Center from my room,Sep 23| 2020,5
Room needs updating.  Carpet looked tired and had stains.  Overall felt the hotel looks tired:,Sep 23| 2020,3
I checked in the room and the room wasn’t clean at all and I opened the Mini fridge it had old food that was smiling really bad and old stuff from last one was in the room and that’s Disgusting!!!!!!!,Sep 22| 2020,1
Very disappointing ..... with the biggest issue being lack of basic requirement of people wearing masks.  No one to monitor that situation| that I saw.  Concierge desk was usually unattended.  ???   Did not feel safe ....Will not go back .... should complain to Hilton,Sep 22| 2020,2
It was wonderful. Staff are very friendly especially a lady who helped me check in process. That was fast and kind. The room  was spacious and clean. Grate place !,Sep 22| 2020,5
Overall a great stay| nice views,Sep 22| 2020,5
The view and room and tv very spacious everything neat and clean,Sep 22| 2020,5
Great experience | everything was perfect & beautiful view.,Sep 22| 2020,5
Loved it | one of the best hotel hands down | booking another stay soon,Sep 21| 2020,5
Room smelled smoke | no housekipping services| the fridge no work | but it’s good the rest,Sep 21| 2020,3
No tenían servicio a la habitación | Pool cerrada| restaurante cerrado | no había desayunado| ni había freezer en la habitación... pedimos una suite y parecía una habitación normal !,Sep 21| 2020,3
Super good! I love the view| my room and the place.,Sep 21| 2020,5
Overall the stay was good. However| there no parking which is crazy for a hotel not to have parking. A guest must of complain about noise at 10:15pm while we were getting ready to go out on a Saturday night. The staff came up to issue a warning and if they came back again we could be evicted smh. This really blow our minds... we didn’t want to ruin the night so we left has we were doing so anyways. Other than that the rooms are nice and the view is great!,Sep 21| 2020,4
I was excited to stay at this hotel because of the amazing views however upon arrival I was taken back by an uncomfortable smell of cigarettes. The entire floor smelled and so did my room I had to ask to move. The second room I was placed in also smelled the same. I did not feel like the room was clean or comfortable. I would not rebook at this hotel,Sep 21| 2020,3
Not expected charge | dirty refrigerator in the room | definitely i didnt like it.,Sep 21| 2020,3
DIDN'T HAVE A MICROOWAVE IN THE ROOM THE SERVICE WASN'T TOO GOOD. THEY IT TOOK AWHILE TO GET ANY SERVICES. THEY ALSO DIDN'T HAVE PARKING FOR GUEST STAYING THERE WHICH IS UNACCEPTABLE AS A RESULT I HAD TO PAY FOR PARKING $180 & RECEIVED A PARKING TICKECT $115,Sep 20| 2020,3
The first room we were assigned to smelled like cigarette smoke we then received a second room which also smelled of cigarettes but the smell was lighter. The roomcarpet seems to have a bad odor.,Sep 20| 2020,3
Great price| terrific view. Clean and roomy. Easy access to food and shopping.,Sep 20| 2020,5
Great location| but not a good service the building smells like weed all the time. No parking I had to pay $59 for every single day I was overthere.,Sep 19| 2020,1
Room was ok .. cleanliness was not good .. dirt at edges of carpet .. need painting .. bathroom sink needs to be replaced .. toilet had rust stains .. refrigerator did not work .. no microwave.. ice machine did not work .. VERY DISAPPOINTED especially for a Hilton property!!,Sep 19| 2020,2
The mini fridge in the room was broken furniture had stains all over it not a great room,Sep 18| 2020,3
It was clean and beautiful. Could See the whole city view. Comfortable bedding.,Sep 18| 2020,5
Great nice looking hotel I had friends stay over & there were Bed bugs in sofabed in the Junior Suite Great Friendly staffThere was no smoking in the hotel & they thought i was smoking & brought security up to my room had them calling my room & the whole time im in the shower They told me multiple people were complaining & it was my first day there,Sep 18| 2020,3
Millennium Hotel was everything they say and advertise. Area is safe and clean. Staff was very professional and followed all Co-Vid 19 rules and regulations. I booked a Junior Suite which was more than enough space for us. The view was excellent because I had never seen the WTC Memorial site. Our window view was right in front and we got to enough the water view also. Parking was a bit pricey but my car was secured.,Sep 18| 2020,5
Amazing location to trains to anywhere in the city. Stayed in a Jr. Suite and was by far the biggest room I’m ever had in the city. Amazing view from the room and would definitely stay again!,Sep 18| 2020,5
Lovely hotel! Rooms are super cozy and has a very nice atmosphere. Also view was beautiful. Could be a little cleaner but would definitely stay again.,Sep 16| 2020,5
The cheap rooms need updating. There’s no fridge or microwave smh. The view is the best thing about the room.,Sep 16| 2020,3
The view was great people friendly place clean. Great time,Sep 15| 2020,5
The only complaint is that the room has no microwave or fridge| and you have to go to another floor to get ice. The staff wasnt so friendly. Great location and stunning view |,Sep 15| 2020,5
It was great| the location was perfect and I really enjoyed myself!,Sep 14| 2020,5
second stay and I will likely stay a third soon. I wish things like the bar was open but other than that| it was a nice stay.,Sep 14| 2020,5
The property is pretty outdated .. the rooms compared to the UN millennium Hilton. The carpet was stained. The control was not in the room. -_-,Sep 13| 2020,2
Tv didn’t work. One of the light fixtures didn’t work.,Sep 13| 2020,3
Spacious room with a view of the World Trade Center. Very clean and staff was wonderful.,Sep 13| 2020,5
The view i from our room was spectacular.Unfortunately| I went to pick up something I dropped by the nightstand and saw hire much dust/dirt was there. It grossed me out.We needed a pen| but one wasn’t provided in the room.,Sep 12| 2020,3
Like the  view of trade centerDon’t like the elevator next to my room is too loud.,Sep 12| 2020,5
I was given a room with a good view. No luggage storage but at least they allowed a late check out.,Sep 11| 2020,4
Didnt have a refrigerator or microwave for my stuff and it went bad the place where the refrigerator was rusty and dusty i spoke to the front desk and they said it was a chillier not a refrigerator but i wouldn't put anything in there wasn't sanitary at all i requested a room change but i was denied. Never again,Sep 9| 2020,2
The check in process was quick | we got a high floor (amazing views!). I’d definitely come back.,Sep 9| 2020,4
When I checked in the lady at the desk was great and very helpful. When I walked into my room it didn’t look as clean as the pictures so I just looked around and the bottom of the bed was dirty| the desk chair was not clean| the toilet was not flushed and we had not used it yet as well as the fridge did not work and was very dirty. We called down to the desk and they said all of the refrigerators were out of commission which would have been nice to know before I checked in because all of my food for the weekend went bad. Also when we turned on the TV you couldn’t even see the imagine because there was lines across the screen. So overall I was not very happy with my stay.,Sep 8| 2020,2
I paid for a junior suite and the room had no fridge or microwave. When I called the front desk about this issue they were rude,Sep 8| 2020,1
The ac in my room was very dirty causing me not able to breathe well with a stuffy nose. Didn’t have room service so trash was piling up. The ice machine on the 16th floor wasn’t available so we had to go to another floor to get it (30th). Hotel room was not the cleanest like we found old tissue and it was just a very dusty room.,Sep 8| 2020,2
The line at check in desk was very long for a long time. Room was very dirty| lots of stains and piles of dust.Carpet was a collection of dust. AC unit was old and loud and lots of dust was coming out of it. Bulbs in the night lights was burned. Handy man never showed up to replace them. This not a Hilton quality stay for sure.,Sep 8| 2020,1
Great views and price. Will considered stay there in the future,Sep 8| 2020,5
The room was spacious| great views and perfect location! Will stay here again.,Sep 8| 2020,4
I was really disappointed with my stay here. Due to COVID I expected the rooms to be extra clean but that was not the case. There was old food left in our mini fridge from the previous guests. Online it states that the rooms are left empty 72 hours between guests so this food was sitting in the mini fridge for over 3 days and smelled so bad. Our bathroom floor was also extremely dirty and there were urine stains around the toilet. We called the front desk to inform them and we were placed on a long hold and then they told us the the only thing they could do was to have someone come and remove the old food but no one was available to clean it. No one came to remove the food that night. It wasn’t until the next day when we put the sign on our door for house keeping that house keeping came and removed the food but didn’t clean the fridge or anything else in the room and we had to request new towels because we weren’t given any. Also I had booked a deluxe room but there was nothing deluxe about it. It was extremely small and it wasn’t worth the extra money for the deluxe. I have stayed at the other Millenium Hilton properties and this one was a huge disappointment.,Sep 8| 2020,2
My birthday,Sep 8| 2020,5
I didn’t see any statement regarding pool being closed| it wasn’t until we were at the property we were told all amenities were closed.  I stayed elsewhere in NYC 2 weeks ago and their bar/restaurant was open.  Also at checkin the representative was not very friendly almost going through the motions.  The room had nice views of the city and location was great.,Sep 8| 2020,4
Friendly staff and cozy room. Amazing city view plenty of stuff to doPizza shop amazing great historical site Word trade center memorial,Sep 7| 2020,5
It took a very long time to check in .. long lines .. at the front desk  ..fridge in the room was not working and broken .. others guest arguing in the hallway early mornings,Sep 7| 2020,1
Our room stunk very strongly like marijuana. Staff was very helpful with trying to get rid of the smell. But would have preferred a new room. Hotel was full booked apparently. Had great experiences during past stays| this one was very disappointing. Probably our last stay sadly since we love the location.,Sep 7| 2020,2
Great stay very clean the only inconvenient part was no parking at all,Sep 7| 2020,5
Things I liked: Great location| affordable|  awesome view. I was on the 42nd floor loved the view! Floor to ceiling windows. Check in was quick and easy. Friendly staff.  Things I did not like: phone in room was not working| asked for it to be fixed but no one showed up| had to use the phone in the hall to order and no outlets next to the bed!!! There were outlets on the desk so I had to leave my phone on the desk while charging. That was annoying to me. When I first walked in the room smelled a little like maybe the previous occupants had smoked in it but it wasn’t that bad no big deal. Fridge was not working. They really need to update the furniture.Conclusion: would I stay here again.... YES I didn’t spend that much time in the room to really be annoyed by the things I didn’t like but If I had I would have been pissed.,Sep 7| 2020,4
Old dusty rooms with terrible beds. Not enough staff to check people in. This is the third Hilton I’ve stayed at over the summer and they’ve all been awful.,Sep 7| 2020,2
I booked a junior suite 45 floor room 4502 . Loved the view I can see my job trinity church a few block away .. the cons the room a bit out dated the chair in the living room was just old and stain...I tried calling front desk multiple times because me and my boyfriend found paper and fonto while cleaning up before leaving so clearly the house keeper didn’t properly clean my room it have me thinking what else house keeping didn’t clean .. the staffing wasn’t all friendly and welcoming .. anyhow I booked another stay at the downtown in 2 weeks I’m going to cancel and try the millennium UN,Sep 7| 2020,3
150 credit card hold. Upon arrival to the hotel| there are no amenities available (restaurants| bar| gym| pool| etc) and even their parking lot was unavailable so you have to park in a parking garage as close as possible| ranging from $60-$70 per day. Due to social distancing| policy requires face masks in the hotel. The elevators allow for only 2 people| so you will wait 5 to 10 minutes just to get to your room. The elevator line usually has 4-15 people waiting. We also learned housekeeping and room service was not available. Even calling down to the front desk for towels| there is no response and the phone will just ring endlessly| so I had to go down and make a request at night. Morning came and my request [for towels] still was unfulfilled. So I had to go back down again to make another request| which finally towels were brought after 3 hours. On my 4th day| I was walking into the lobby behind a group of several people| but the man at the door ran me down while I was carrying several bags| and made me produce my hotel card| though the group in front of me was not stopped. I've been seen by and spoken to this man before and other personnel| and at no other point had I been made to produce evidence of being a guest. Though the hotel is non-smoking| my room had a cigarette odor that seems someone has tried to cover; it is disgusting. There are no microwaves or fridges in the room. I am not sure why this hotel is even open.,Sep 7| 2020,1
I loved the view in my hotel room and the television quality was great! HBO movies available! The bad side of this hotel is - the water was brownish when I first turned it on| there was bugs crawling on the wall| the AC and refrigerator does not work. Also there is no microwave that I was able to use.,Sep 6| 2020,2
Nice place| all amenities were unavailable due to COVID-19. Room view was amazing,Sep 6| 2020,5
No sense staying here. No parking at all| nothing but,Sep 6| 2020,2
It took ay least one hour to check in there was a long line even i checked in late ( 5:00 pm),Sep 6| 2020,3
Excellent view| very nice staff and clean rooms. The only thing that could be better is the TV| pretty outdated.,Sep 5| 2020,5
We enjoyed out stay at the Millennium Hotel.The staff was friendly| professional and courteous. We stayed in a junior suite which was spacious with a city view; which was fabulous. The bed was very comfortable; the bathroom was big with good lighting| the sitting room had a nice size sofa which was comfortable and there was a lot of windows with amazing views of the World Trade Center| the Oculus| the Memorial and the waterfront. The hotel is located in downtown Manhattan with a variety of restaurants and shopping. I would definitely stay there again!,Sep 5| 2020,4
Was smell like sigarette and no one clean my room in 3 days . So really disappointed,Sep 4| 2020,5
The hotel itself looks nice. But in honesty I walked thru the halls a lot and took the elevator often I did not see much of a cleaning crew for the common areas which really worried me. People were getting into the elevators with no mask on. The rooms seemed like they were just quickly cleaned. The TVs worked like I was in the Stone Age. Horrible experience for such a high profile spot.,Sep 4| 2020,2
Very disappointed in this hotel | my watch was stolen and the hotel have not yet did anything about it . The junior suite was a disappointment . Room needed to be updated and renewed .. i complained numerous of times and no one did anything . Never should’ve came here on my birthday . Only thing i like was the view .,Sep 1| 2020,1
No parking at the hotel|all parking around is $70 dollars per night|and the staff including the manager is rude.,Sep 1| 2020,1
Nice view to Freedom Tower nice location for shopping,Aug 30| 2020,5
I like the view and the room. I was on 49th floor and I had a view on the National September 11 Memorial Museum.,Aug 29| 2020,5
The stay was okay it wasn’t bad| a lot of the hotels amenities were not open. When we needed our bedding changed they were willing to give up the bedding but not change the bedding for us. I think if the amenities were open it would have been better. The hotel should reach out to the reservations and tell it’s future guest that all the amenities weren’t open.,Aug 28| 2020,3
El hotel no informo que todo esta fuera de servicio y no tenian agua en la habitacion,Aug 28| 2020,3
This is the worst 😫 hotel in the history of hotels. The services sucks the cleaning service dont do a good job. When i checked in at 3pm i asked for  a microwave and a mini fringe i did not received those items until 11pm and i had to call 5 times to get it second the elevators was not working and we stayed on the 49th floor such a devastating and disaster 😢 we had to endup taking the services elevator. This hotel is absolutely 💯 horrible 😫.  However the neighborhood is excellent. The restaurant around the area is exquisite. And the view from the river side is wonderful.,Aug 26| 2020,1
I never stayed I request a refund because I check out the next day the 8/14 and I was supposed to stay till the 8/16 room was dirty I got sick it was dusty,Aug 26| 2020,1
If your looking for a hotel with a beautiful view of New York City| this is the hotel for you!!,Aug 25| 2020,5
Nice n clean. Fast check in. Nice staff. Next to stores n restaurants,Aug 25| 2020,4
Awful.  I'll never stay here again.  My room had black mold in the bathroom and my sheets were not clean.  The service at the front desk was terrible.  I understand Covid has everything screwed up but yikes this wasn't worth it at all.,Aug 24| 2020,1
The person at checkin was kinda rude wasn’t helpful at all he could clearly see that I picked the room option that serves breakfast when I ask him about it he said everything is closed in a dismissive tone.,Aug 24| 2020,3
But stinky room| carpet was dirty and very looks really old,Aug 22| 2020,1
It’s in a great location for what we can to look at and eat dinner. Needs to be updated. You are paying for the location not the hotel. All amenities cancel| breakfast| pool even though things should be open from coronavirus. I paid for breakfast so Expedia owes me money.  We had a junior suite nice space but just old. And awesome views of the city and the oculus.,Aug 22| 2020,3
Great hotel| nice staff| clean rooms| amazing area,Aug 22| 2020,5
I chose this location b/c it was walking distance to an event| and during Covid| I don't want to take cabs. I also chose it b/c it offered valet for my car and I knew I'd need to check a bag for the day. Neither service was operational b/c of the pandemic. There were a lot of people partying| and you could both hear| and smell their activities. There were also no non-feather pillow options in the hotel upon request.,Aug 19| 2020,2
Fantastic location and hotel in general. At this time the hotel has to suspend a lot of there normal services| Restaurant| Bar| Room Service| ETC. Regardless| what an awesome stay!,Aug 17| 2020,5
The city view on the room it was beautiful and convenient,Aug 16| 2020,5
Furniture outdated and wornVents in bathroom so filthy Bed sheet had holes in itCarpet multiple stains Gross not what it use to be,Aug 14| 2020,2
Everything was very clean! Bed was comfortable and sheets were nice. The hallway outside my room smelled like a garbage shoot so that was kind of gross. Staff wasn’t the nicest. We asked for a wine opener over the phone and waited 20 minutes. Finally I went down to the lobby and they said they’d send one up. Another 40 minutes went by and no wine opener. One day of our stay the elevators weren’t working. (Kind if problematic since we stayed on the 51st floor.) They allowed guests to use the employee/freight elevator which was nice. But I had walked right passed the front desk toward the Normal elevator and  Waited there for a good 10 minutes before I finally went to the front desk to ask if the elevators were working. Why didn’t anyone stop me from waiting for the elevator when I walked passed 2 employees at the front desk?The location however is amazing. Central to everything and every subway. Overall| I wouldn’t recommend this hotel to anyone staying more than 1 night.,Aug 14| 2020,3
I have been going to this hotel since 2013; granted| I have not been since late 2016| but this weekend in 2020 was awful: the room was grimy| moldy in the bathroom| paint chipped and peeling| wall paper with paint marks all over it| the chairs looked soiled| the room smelled of smoke| kids running around and banging things at 10:30pm--horrible experience.,Aug 11| 2020,2
Great location however| everything in the area is still shut down.,Aug 10| 2020,5
We didn’t like how the reception staff greeted us,Aug 10| 2020,3
Everything was great except the mini bar is cancelled and there are no amenities but still a resort fee. But their security fee is only $50 considering everything. Staff and room was amazing and if you can| make reservations for “The Cut”| the food was amazing,Aug 9| 2020,4
Upon arriving the concierge energy was very degrading and rude. Then after waiting two to three hours after checkin because our room was not ready In time. They then put us in the disgusting room. I was then referred to a manager after complaining and I was compensated,Aug 9| 2020,2
The Only Things I Actually Liked about this hotel was the area and my view. Nothing that they said was offered came with my service. They don’t even have a mini fridge. A lot of false advertising happening within Hilton. I was very disappointed.,Aug 8| 2020,2
Extremely unhelpful staff. I had to lug in my luggage by myself. No one there to help. Tiny rooms| no toilet pressure| low shower pressure|no refrigerator| clock wasn’t working. When I addressed the refrigerator problem (I need to keep my daughters medicine in the fridge) they told me I can have one but I’d have to get the Presidential suite. Lol...ok. I called one morning for shower caps and they told me they ran out. I didn’t believe them. I was VERY surprised that a Hilton hotel was like this.,Aug 7| 2020,2
There was zero amenities . No fridge that I paid extra for. I also paid for breakfast to b included and there was none. Place was stained and dusty. Tv wasn’t working properly. Huge disappointment| only thing good was the view,Aug 5| 2020,3
Dirty. Dead cockroaches. Old and not to Hilton quality,Aug 4| 2020,1
I stayed at a junior suite overlooking the west side| the 36th floor view was amazing| very comfortable and a nice place to stay.,Aug 3| 2020,5
I wanted to enjoy the pool but it was closed,Aug 3| 2020,5
Beautiful location| quick check in and very clean! Will definitely be back to stay!,Aug 2| 2020,5
The hotel was amazing me and my husband stayed in a Junior suite the view was amazing and the customer service was great.. I definitely recommend this hotel!! Will Stay again!!,Aug 2| 2020,5
Clean and fast check in. Service was great.  Great location as well. Street parking only.,Jul 27| 2020,5
It was okay| the view was great but the place was a little dusty. Some areas were not cleaned and some items didn't work.,Jul 23| 2020,4
Sparkling clean and attentive service. Very nice view!,Jul 23| 2020,5
we were told that breakfast would be included with our room up charge but when we got there they said that all the food facilites were closed and we did not get breakfast with our room include as it said on your website during booking the rooms for this Hotel!! was very upset you should have told us otherwise we would have mad other arrangements!!,Jul 21| 2020,1
Dirty hotel my ac on room was not working on a day that was 90 degrees outside I called front desk to let them know they kept transferring me to managers voicemail the rugs were stained the bathroom was dirty and mini fridge was not functioning and smelt like something died in it never staying here again,Jul 19| 2020,1
Fantastic views. However| currently no room service. The room we were checked into had a running toilet that would not stop. Management promptly moved us to another room.,Jul 13| 2020,4
had the best experience from check in all the way through check out! views were amazing. and so close to all my fav little spots in TriBeCa. will definitely stay here often.,Jul 12| 2020,5
Very comfortable. Very safe. Very quiet. We will definitely stay again,Jul 10| 2020,5
Due to covid 19  the pool and resturant was closed,Jul 10| 2020,4
The hotel was good| great views| rooms are a bit dated and need a refresh,Jul 8| 2020,4
I always wanted to stay in this hotel given its excellent location and awesome views. Unfortunately the property is run down. My room was not very clean| AC did not work| the elevators were dirty. Very disappointing. I'm not planning to stay there again.,Jul 8| 2020,2
The view from our room was nothing short of amazing. It was small| and the bed was definitely not a King| it was a really uncomfortable mattress as well. Had many issues with the tv shutting off by itself|  the guide didn't work either.  Ice machine on our floor didnt work which was a issue for me especially being on the 50th floor.,Jul 8| 2020,4
Great views| clean rooms. Refrigerator did not work.,Jul 8| 2020,4
Excellent location near from everything and great views of world trade center,Jul 7| 2020,5
When it comes to hotel service| I rate high based on employees' attitudes when it comes to winning me over  with blazing customer service. You know| eye contact| professionalism| friendliness| etc. The staff at this Wall Street location display none of that. They weren't blatantly rude; no. However| with the dozens and dozens of other lodging choices in the New York Metro Area| your staff should be practically tapdancing for every customer that walks through the door. Especially during a worldwide pandemic. For my entire stay| I never received from the hotel staff the impression that they were eager for me to ever come back. And I won't be.,Jul 6| 2020,2
The pool was closed and it the app said it was open,Jul 5| 2020,4
A very nice hotel with a great view!  The staff very accommodating.,Jun 24| 2020,5
My lady did love it,Jun 22| 2020,4

Stayed during covid... hotel was very clean and staff was helpful and kind.Slept well- quiet room| beautiful views!!!,Jun 20| 2020,5
The room took really long to cool and there was nothing exciting about the service. But the view was very very beaitiful,Jun 19| 2020,3
Dirty rooms stAins all over rug and bed staff had huge attitudes,Jun 6| 2020,1
Beautiful view and location staff was very helpful.,May 29| 2020,4
Nothing was unique the mini bar wasn’t stocked the room look dirty looked like a covid room Only good thing was the tv,May 29| 2020,1
The Amazing Views of the City. I  grew up here and Worked here my entire Adult Life but Still am Amazed at how Beautiful the City is at Night| even during this Pandemic.,May 17| 2020,4
The view is amazing | I extended my stay because this was by far the best experience ever,May 16| 2020,5
I was in the 43rd floor and the view of 1 world trade| the entire downtown and NJ was amazing!!!,Apr 30| 2020,5
Everyone was very pleasant and professionals. Will recommend this hotel to my friends,Mar 19| 2020,5
I didn’t like that the mini fridge in my room wasn’t working. When reported nothing was done,Mar 17| 2020,4
We really enjoyed our stay and the location was great,Mar 13| 2020,5
Very nice hotel in a really good area!! It’s just a bit outdated.,Mar 11| 2020,4
Nice stay ... right across the street of the 911 Memorials. And we walked / in walking distance of lots of great restaurants and shops ... also the Charging Bill and the Fearless Girl statues of Wallstreet.,Mar 9| 2020,5
Very friendly staff. Was able to visit the pool and bar. Had to step out after checkout and they accomodated holding my bags.,Mar 3| 2020,4
The room was cozy|  great mattress|  great view.  I would definitely recommend this to my friends,Feb 25| 2020,5
Location was perfect.  Subway station access is right outside the door| shopping is right outside the door| and WTC/Oculus is right across the street.  Friendly and helpful staff| if you need anything just ask.,Feb 25| 2020,5
Staff was more than helpful .  Hair dryer would not work and they were up with a new one in no time,Feb 25| 2020,5
Great stay| nice view| great staff| highly recommend.,Feb 21| 2020,5
Family trip. Hotel was clean. Staff was not overly friendly. Compared to our other stays in NYC. We enjoyed the pool. Location to transportation and shopping was great. Wish they would of had USB ports for charging electronics in the room. Beds were not as described. It was an OK stay.,Feb 20| 2020,2
The view was amazing. The bed was comfortable and the soap they provide smelled awesome. The room was nice| but was not cleaned extremely thoroughly. I found a bottle cap on the floor near the bed| in the corner of the room near the dresser there was a dirty cotton ball and an old french fry (ew)| and the snacks were not replenished before I checked in... there was only a can of Pringles and a granola bar left. The TV quality was very poor for a Hilton hotel and the room smelled like cigarettes.,Feb 18| 2020,4
Great Stay no issues at all,Feb 18| 2020,5
Was told three times by three different people that parking was included with my stay. When I went to checkout| I was told I had to pay an extra $130 for my car. I’ve been here five years in a row and this is the first time they’ve ever tried to charge me. They also lost my car key and never gave me a ticket for my key. Parking garage was disorganized.,Feb 17| 2020,2
My stay was amazing| I had stayed there a few times now but this time my bed was very hard it was uncomfortable but other than that would stay again and if my bed was like that I would request another room.,Feb 17| 2020,4
Parking is horrible my only concern everything else was great,Feb 16| 2020,4
Loved the views... The easy access to main attraction. Exemplary customer service.,Feb 10| 2020,5
It was awesome| everyone was helpful. Will do it again.,Feb 10| 2020,5
We love it,Feb 7| 2020,5
As a family I think it’s fine if the beds were a bit less bouncy we had double beds thinking they were queens| they were like two twins and we had two kids with us. Customer service was not the best. The pool is much smaller than pictured. But overall ok to stay at.,Jan 27| 2020,3
Awesome position| and great view of 9/11 memorial,Jan 26| 2020,5
Central to city activitiesClean Easy to locate in city,Jan 26| 2020,3
Clean hotel| but the beds and pillows are not very comfortable. Good not great.,Jan 26| 2020,4
The location and the view were spactacular. The staff weals hospitable and accommodating. On the other hand| the hotel was absolutely filthy. Was it worth the view? I’m on the fence,Jan 24| 2020,3
It was an amazing experience! The staff was friendly| the room was superb and the view was incredible! We were on the 53rd floor.,Jan 23| 2020,5
Too expensive. For that price should have had free breakfast at least.,Jan 22| 2020,4
The lack of WiFi was frustrating. Rooms were clean but not exceptionally so.,Jan 22| 2020,3
Luxury hotel in great location and beautiful view.,Jan 21| 2020,5
The Millennium Hotel is perfectly located for exploring New York on foot or by the nearby Metro. Our room| which overlooked the Oculus and 9/11 Memorial|  was spotlessly clean and had fabulous views of the city.,Jan 20| 2020,5
Easy and quick to check in. Staff very friendly| room clean no problems with anything,Jan 19| 2020,4
The hotel staff is absolutely amazing and allowed me to check in early with no fuss or extra fees.,Jan 19| 2020,5
Great location and value for NYC! View is amazing. And room is clean and has what you need. Will be back.,Jan 13| 2020,4
Stayed a few hours here because I was looking forward to go home! Came into the city for a show and datenight and was out by the am. The hotel is in serious need of updating I felt like i was stay at a motel with a view. The room was dated| very hot| smelled and didnt look clean.,Jan 12| 2020,1
Great view!,Jan 10| 2020,5
Great location| but the restaurant prices are outrages,Jan 8| 2020,5
Very convenient location just yards from both Cortland & Fulton Subway stations. Directly across the street from One World Tower. Walking distance from Staten Island & Brookfield terminal. Typical Hilton property very clean & reasonably modern| if a bit clinical. One receptionist was entirely humourless but all other staff were pleasant. Returning to our room one evening we found it to have an overpowering smell of marijuana. No hint of it in the corridor outside just our room. We rang reception who said they would send security up to us but they never showed. We rang again and the offered to come and spray air freshener! We declined this offer. Nothing was out of place other than the alarm clock was unplugged. We had a high floor junior suite which had fantastic views of the One World Tower & plaza.,Jan 7| 2020,4
Great location| very clean rooms and attentive staff. The only suggestions would be more comfortable pillows| usable mini fridge and usb outlets.,Jan 7| 2020,5
Location is greatStaff very helpful.Some upgrade of carpets would be an improvement.,Jan 7| 2020,4
The location is of course| fantastic. However| we were disappointed by the room. It was in dire need of an upgrade; the carpet was dirty and stained| the curtains were also dirty and stained| and there was not refrigerator. The small refrigerator that was in the room was packed full of stuff to purchase and the refrigerator was not even cold. The pool was very small and there was no spa (Jacuzzi). Perhaps worst of all| there were only two full beds in the room that were barely suited to one person| and definitely not two adults. The mattresses were terrible! I could feel the springs. We would have liked to have ordered room service the evening we arrived because we were exhausted from travelling but they wanted $24 for one burger. I understand that room service is usually expensive but $24 for a burger? Also| the final bill included charges for three snacks/drinks that they claimed we took from the "refrigerator" or "mini-bar" (whatever they want to call it) that we had most definitely not taken. They didn't argue with us and they readily deducted the items from our final bill. I definitely would not recommend this hotel to any of my friends.,Jan 6| 2020,2
I ain’t like how tv didn’t have YouTube service was bad and bad connection,Jan 5| 2020,1
We planned a short stay in NY for New Years. Even though we drove it was nice to see it was right next to a train station. The staff was nice even though one doorman looked a bit irritated that night. We were upgraded to the junior suite which has the most amazing view of the world trade memorial. The best hotel I’ve stayed in while visiting NY thus far. Only no complementary breakfast.,Jan 4| 2020,5
As always| great to stay here; all the crew super friendly. I will stay again soon.,Jan 4| 2020,5
I book a one night stay for a personal “staycation” - with this in mind| I believe| is the reason why the front desk attendant placed me in a handicap accessible room. The view is beautiful but the bed and toilet are considerably low - I’m 5foot 9 so this is a bit uncomfortable. I’d like fair consideration for comfort being a hhonors member and an overall loyal patron. The duration of my stay should not come into consideration when placing a “fully callable” person in a room that is comparable to what was requested at booking.”,Jan 3| 2020,5
We really enjoyed the service. The room was quiet and the view was spectacular of lower Manhattan. We will definitely stay here again.,Jan 1| 2020,5
Excellent location in lower Manhattan. Easy connection from the Grand Central terminal| lines 5&6 downtown Brooklyn. Room was very spacious offering a picturesque view at New York City Hall. Friendly staff. Quick checking/checkout.,Dec 28| 2019,5
Due to the price I expected the hotel to be outdated and showing wear. I was correct. The rooms are worn and showing their age. The lobby and other common areas were ok and the staff was very friendly. The worst part was the AC did not work in our suite. We had to open a window to get it to cool down in our room. The location was good.,Dec 28| 2019,2
My son and I took a one-day "daycation" here and loved it. The location is great--in the heart of downtown NYC and directly across from the World Trade Center--and the hotel is very nice. The staff were welcoming| pleasant| and helpful. Our room was clean| the bed was very comfy| and our view from the 45th floor was magnificent. We could see the Freedom Tower| one of the footprints of the Twin Towers| and the Hudson River from our room. The pool is nice| though it could stand an update. Wonderful stay overall.,Dec 27| 2019,5
I really like the property it was beautiful inside and out. It was a trip for my boyfriend’s birthday everything met our expectations and then some. The hotel is kinda pricey but the area we were in made sense.,Dec 25| 2019,5
Location was great for us.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  Hotel Lobby and our room were kept clean.Room furniture was worn and dated.All in all we were pleased with our voice of this Hilton property.,Dec 23| 2019,4
Very good views and very kind professional staff! The restraint was very well and professional to!,Dec 21| 2019,5
Front desk was very unresponsive!!  Hairdryer in room was broken. Requested a replacement| which never came even after 2 requests. Bathroom door was very loose.,Dec 19| 2019,3
The room had an amazing view!  I wish the pool had a hot tub or sauna.,Dec 19| 2019,3
this hotel has an incredible location  amazing views   with easy access to all     the property is well maintained in spite of surrounding construction   that in no way disturbs quiet and comfort    the staff is warm and friendly   we were especially surprised with champagne and strawberries in our room when we returned from dinner    thank you hilton  OUTSTANDING,Dec 16| 2019,5
Property is very tired and in need of a renovation.,Dec 16| 2019,3
It was a great place to stay,Dec 15| 2019,5
Expected a better view| but overall the hotel was nice.,Dec 15| 2019,3
Overall very good in a great location and have stayed multiple times. The WiFi isn’t great even if you have to pay for it but they were willing to help to fix. A lot of places to go nearby especially the WTC and the 9/11 Museum which is a must see.,Dec 15| 2019,5
I was only there for a night so was looking for a restful night before flying out of the country. The bed was past its useful life with a slack and worn out mattress| the toilet did not flush properly and overall| it was a tired room.,Dec 15| 2019,3
The room was great. It was clean very comfortable even the bed was very comfy and the pillows as well...,Dec 14| 2019,5
Location superb. Would stay there again without hesitation.,Dec 14| 2019,4
We love this hotel.  Our daughter attends college in the financial district| and this hotel is very convenient for visiting her.  The hotel is top notch.  Great staff| nice accommodations| close to many NYC sights.  One of our favorite places.,Dec 14| 2019,5
The downtown location is superb (much quieter than around the higher density tourist spots like Time square). Immediate proximity to subway is a huge plus,Dec 10| 2019,3
The view was breathtaking| great services and food,Dec 9| 2019,5
Everything i liked breakfast and lunch/diner was amazing,Dec 8| 2019,5

loved the view of the world trade center area.  speed of check in and out process.  staff was curious and helpful.  no free wifi was a downer.  bathroom shower and its low flow drives me crazy.  we only ate breakfast but food was very good.,Nov 29| 2019,5
Beautiful view| right in front of the World Trade Center !!,Nov 28| 2019,5
LOVE THE LOCATION OF THIS HOTEL.IN THE MIDDLE OF A LOT IN THE BIG APPLE AND EASY ACCESS TO SUBWAY. ROOMS WITH AWESOME VIEWS OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER AND THE WORK OBSERVATORY  !!! WISH YOU CONSIDER THIS PLACE!,Nov 26| 2019,5
What a wonderful hotel in an excellent location!  The views were stunning.  Clean comfortable rooms| friendly helpful staff.  Fabulous stay in the Big Apple!,Nov 26| 2019,5
Location was convenient. They originally gave us a room that reeked of smoke| but worked to move us to another room. Suite was comfortable| though the beds were hard foam. Nice to have a pool and convenient to grab breakfast at the hotel restaurant. Seems place is going to need to be updated| but over clean and upkept. Staff was very professional and hospitable. I’d return,Nov 25| 2019,4
We had a beautiful room with a perfect view.   The hotel was clean and staff was efficient.   We didn't eat on site but I have no complaints and look forward to returning.  The location is excellent as well.,Nov 25| 2019,5
Good location. But being so close to a business area| I'm surprised the wifi was so bad. I got dropped 4x's in 1 hour while working in the room. I brought this up to the concierge| who supposedly sent someone to check on it. Nothing. Please tv reception was pure snowflakes. For a Millennium?! Unacceptable.,Nov 24| 2019,3
Top notch. Top property. Highly recommend as it is in great location and service is great. Front desk| bellmen| to bar and even room service all were great.,Nov 23| 2019,5

Location is good. The hotel is nice. It’s near the 9/11 or the so called ground zero. Accessible,Nov 16| 2019,5
Very conveniently located| with Oculus| 911 memorial and One World Trade Center just across the street and several metro lines close by.  The property is a little dated| but the overall conditions are ok.  Comfy bed| with complimentary bottled water| coffee and tea.,Nov 16| 2019,4

Our room was very clean we loved the view of the city from our room.,Nov 5| 2019,5
The view from the room is incredible. And it is within short walking distance to shopping and great restaurants. Coffee machine is in the room but they don't serve coffee anywhere else until after 7 am.,Nov 3| 2019,5
The view from our rooms was truly amazing!!!  We were on the 50th floor and we look out across the 911 memorial and across the Hudson to Brooklyn.  It was truly gorgeous!,Oct 28| 2019,4
Great stay. The beds were tiny. Not truly a full bed.,Oct 28| 2019,5
Old and tired but great location. Expensive for what it was!!!,Oct 26| 2019,2
Did not get the room type I booked. Did not get bed size or bathroom. Box spring on bed not covered and had damage. Not as I expected. Had to be on the phone with Expedia for 1 and a half hours to try and resolve this after long day of work and I was tired. Did not get resolved. Expedia canceled the second night without my  request and I needed to find a room after another long day of work. I was very upset.,Oct 25| 2019,1
Stay was okay. The mini bar fridge was not working. It was dirty. We needed the fridge because we had some food that needed to be kept cold and when my husband called they were not very accommodative. They did eventually bring in a fridge. My thing is if you are going to charge $365 per night| you better have a clean working fridge.,Oct 18| 2019,3
I am so glad I chose this downtown location as it provided a brilliant starting off point for attractions (2 days with my 13 year old son in NYC). Attractive location| great local restaurants| Citi bikes and sub wait stop on street next door. Pool was a lovely tonic with a bright aspect but rather dated.Breakfast was good expensive.Lovely staff.,Oct 18| 2019,4
Everything was as we expected! Great hotel,Oct 16| 2019,5
I liked the view of the city and the bed was comfortable. The refrigerator did not work and the towels in the bathroom were very scratchy. But the staff were very friendly.,Oct 15| 2019,3
Super location| ideal for business trips and week trips,Oct 15| 2019,5
The location was fantastic and our room had great views.  They did not replenish items in fridge during stay.  Other than view the room was nothing special.,Oct 14| 2019,4
Nice for quick business trip great location by world trade center easy subway access,Oct 13| 2019,4
The best aspect of this hotel stay and the hotel itself were the staff members we encountered throughout the day| from the terriffic doorman and bellhop to the very able front desk receptionist to the excellent wait staff in the restaurant... Wonderful people that made the trip very pleasant. Thanks.,Oct 12| 2019,4
Location was fantastic. Staff was friendly. Room was clean.,Oct 12| 2019,5
The room was spacious and the location was close to everything.,Oct 11| 2019,4
We had 3 rooms all close to one another   We loved the location some used the pool and some used the pool. Staff was great,Oct 11| 2019,5
Beautiful view from our room| we stayed in #4005. Perfect location and easy access to the subway taking you around city if needed.,Oct 7| 2019,4
Hotel was clean| room was spacious and view of one world trade was amazing. My only complaint is that a very loud noise came from the bathroom periodically throughout the night which kept waking me up. Perhaps there are pipe issues that need to be resolved.,Oct 2| 2019,5
Fantastic in every way. Well done. Made our time special.,Oct 2| 2019,5
Hilton is garbage. I spent $2|000 at this dumpy hotel where I heard people through the walls| and then got Zero points for my stay b/c I booked through Expedia and not directly through Hilton. What made it worse is I was asked at check in if I wanted breakfast or extra points - even though they knew I booked through Expedia!!This hotel is a dump and the service is awful.,Oct 2| 2019,1
This was a great property.  I was late coming to the hotel and my king size bedroom was given away.  The manager was very helpful with getting me a better room which suited me.,Sep 30| 2019,5
Great location for sight seeing activities.  Shopping just across the street too,Sep 28| 2019,5
The staff was great. Location was also very good. The hotel is in need of a renovation. The bathroom shower drain was not working well. The carpet had stains. Was expecting more considering the price we paid for the room.,Sep 27| 2019,4
Great location for visiting 9/11 Memorial and Museum.  Excellent bar with very good view.  Close to subway.,Sep 25| 2019,5
Perfect location in TriBeCa financial district area. Beautiful views from rooms Looking at ground zero.Rooms need upgrading.,Sep 23| 2019,4
Location was great.  Also had great views of city.,Sep 23| 2019,4
Very close to One World Trade Center| and I had a great view from the window.,Sep 22| 2019,5
Beautiful view of the freedom tower. Did not like that I had to pay a fee for checking out an hour after my check out time,Sep 22| 2019,5
overall everything was great. The electronics were terrible. The tv was a very old model with a very poor picture| almost antenna type reception| and the wifi was very very slow.,Sep 17| 2019,4
Gym could have been better appoitment with a more up to date weight system. Other than that the treadmills| elipitical and bike was great,Sep 17| 2019,4
Amazing hotel. Great service by everyone that works in the hotel. Not one bad thing I could say. Stay here if you get the chance,Sep 17| 2019,5
The parking cost and time to get your car. The Location was nice,Sep 16| 2019,4
Fitness center|  size of hotel| clean| everything is great!,Sep 16| 2019,5
Very conveniently located hotel in lower Manhattan. Excellent views. Room was clean and comfortable. Rooms are nice| but not updated. No USB ports| but that's a minor inconvenience. Overall would absolutely stay there again.,Sep 16| 2019,5
Only passing through NY. Fantastic location and view,Sep 16| 2019,5
Amazing Views from 48th Floor room.  Great new demo room of the new modernized renovation to come! Great customer service too!,Sep 14| 2019,5
Great location near transportation and activities.  Nice staff.  BUT the bed was uncomfortable (lumpy)| the air conditioner was very loud and the carpets had seen better days (obviously worn and stained).,Sep 13| 2019,3
Amazing view. Courteous staff. Beautiful room.,Sep 13| 2019,5
Very clean property with a very professional staff. The location was fabulous! I was very pleased,Sep 10| 2019,4
first room was not what i expected| upgrade to what i thought i was getting was perfect.,Sep 10| 2019,5
my husband and I had a fantastic stay...thank you,Sep 9| 2019,5
Hotel is not maintained as expected.,Sep 9| 2019,4
I like how close we were to many things. Lots to do and see within walking distance.,Sep 8| 2019,4
The view from my room was beautiful| overall the experience was very good. I would recommend this hotel.,Sep 7| 2019,4
The staff was very nice. The elevators were pretty scary and the hotel was a bit outdated. But the view was amazing definitely my favorite part of the weekend.,Sep 7| 2019,4
The location was great for my trip| but there were huge dust bunnies on the tv “cabinet|” housekeeping had to come remove a large bug| my A/C broke| and there was a piece of plastic in my overpriced sandwich. Overall| I was not impressed.,Sep 4| 2019,2
It was advertised as 2 Full beds. The beds were far smaller than Fulls. Closer to a Twin. Very uncomfortable. Also| one morning we were woken by a housekeeper screaming at a guest from the hallway for 20 minutes.,Sep 4| 2019,3
Great and iconic hotel right across from the WTC and oculus. We were on just the 12th floor and the views were great! Bed was so comfortable and room was spacious| which was pleasantly surprising to me because most hotel rooms I have stayed in while in NYC were tiny. Drawbacks: pool looks way better in pictures| it was quite small in person and reminded me of 3 star level hotel pools. Also apparently a bartender got nasty with my associate staying in my room but the hotel gave us free breakfast for the rest of the stay as compensation. All in all great stay| I will stay there again.,Sep 3| 2019,5
The room was spacious and surface level clean. There was a layer of dust in the TV stand| hard to miss. The carpets in the hallways and elevators are very dated| discolored. The issue I had with my room was noise. I could hear when the rooms either side of mine flushed their toilets. It was very disruptive. Location is great though| I'd say fairly priced due to that point. Great view!,Sep 3| 2019,4
Fantastic location and spitting-distance to Fulton Plaza and all the transit it entails; the WTC location didn't make it way too busy| either| even though it was a Labour Day weekend. However| the washroom toilet emitted a constant sound| the fridge wasn't particularly cold| and staff were not helpful when it came to WiFi access or our hotel keycards| which consistently failed to work| including one morning at 5am that required multiple trips to the desk.,Sep 3| 2019,3
First night in 4 nights in NYC that was quiet great locale,Aug 31| 2019,4
Directly across from the world trade centre complex of shops| museums| Eataly| etc. Subway stop at the doorstop. Staff provided outstanding service.,Aug 30| 2019,5
I enjoyed the location of the property and the view.,Aug 29| 2019,4
Family trip to see New York City hotel was right across ground zero memorial and walking distance to the pier to see the Statue of Liberty,Aug 28| 2019,5
The property location was excellent. It was right by a subway station and had excellent views. The hotel pool was a little older and very chlorinated it could do with a bit of money being spent on it. Also we had to complain about our chiller as it stank of old cheeses and did not keep things cold. However nothing was done about this.,Aug 27| 2019,4
It was fabulous right from the start. We got to the hotel early and just expected to drop our bags off but our room happened to be ready and the view was incredible. Perfect location to visit the seaport and we even walked across the Brooklyn Bridge and had lunch right by the water with views of both bridges. Fabulous time.,Aug 26| 2019,5
In front of the world trade center station| 9/11 museum and malls near by.,Aug 26| 2019,5
Location is the only good thing. Otherwise hotel rooms are dated. Most of the snacks in room were expired. Room was like a motel room.,Aug 26| 2019,3
Excellent hotel. A microwave and fridge would have made it ideal 😊,Aug 20| 2019,5
Great location downtown and view,Aug 20| 2019,4
Surprisingly the basic queen room didn’t have basic amenities like a microwave or a mini fridge. The television worked but every channel was very grainy| the magnifying mirror in the bathroom was broken and the pillows on the bed were so flat you have to stack all four for neck support. We were on the 12th floor and the room had a wonderful view of WTC and the waterfront. Great location for sure - close to Century21 and HM. Best food cart was at the corner of Liberty and Broadway called Indian King - amazing $6 hot plates. Google “Hilton promo codes” for discounts when booking here- you’ll save at least $75 with Hilton sponsored online promo codes.,Aug 19| 2019,3
Great stay| spent my anniversary here it was very nice and we loved the view. Oh and the pool was big plus!,Aug 16| 2019,5
Nice hotel| great views and central location. Beware the mini-fridge: it's a you touch it| you buy it deal. Would have been nice to have an empty fridge instead to store a few late night snacks. But! That's nitpicking. Overall| really great stay. Would stay again.,Aug 16| 2019,4
View was amazing . Cleanliness to perfection great customer service just everything was great,Aug 16| 2019,5
Good location for visiting Manhattan downtown.,Aug 15| 2019,5
The hotel building was so beautiful! The view from our hotel room was amazing. Staff was very friendly! We had a few minor issues| such as having to get some of the pillow cases and sheets changed from certain stains. I would suggest the hotel upgrading on their televisions. It was really outdated and not a clear picture. Overall it was a pleasant experience!,Aug 12| 2019,4
Great location| great view| very safe.  They need more chairs around the pool and should turn the First Aid Office next to pool into a steam room.  Also open the Lobby bar earlier on weekends.,Aug 9| 2019,5
It was horrible the whole stay was in convenient no help at all,Aug 7| 2019,1
Happy property was near the 911 Memorial; nice to discover Wall Street was so close| too|Carpet in hallway could use some cleaning.,Aug 5| 2019,5
Everything was great except for the reception desk guy’s attitude. He wasn’t polite | friendly or helpful.,Aug 3| 2019,5
We got stuck in the elevator also I was over charged on my dining & parking worst visit ever!,Aug 3| 2019,1
Love the location and the staff was great.........,Aug 2| 2019,5
I arrived later the in the evening after getting lost on a hot summer day. I walked in exhausted| and the gentleman in the front desk took noticed. His name was Antonio| and he made sure we enjoyed our one night stay.,Jul 30| 2019,5
Great hotel!!! Very well located| and if compared to other I stayed this is a steal. Very inexpensive for the quality!,Jul 28| 2019,5
room was filthy...staff was unwelcoming... bottle of water cost 7$ ..free in many hotels...neither bar was open when we arrived nor later in evening... we have stayed there several times in the past we will never stay there again,Jul 26| 2019,1
Loved the location-across from several ‘must sees’ in NYC; close to subways if going elsewhereRoom a bit ‘dated’ but fantastic views and plenty spacious for NY for two in King bed roomNice staff but was a bit annoyed when we realized we forgot our phone charger not 20 mins after leaving and they claim they didn’t have itVery fair price for our last minute trip!!Would return and recommend this property!,Jul 22| 2019,4
There was good views from the window and there was a bar,Jul 22| 2019,3
Best location-DO NOT Rent a car. Parking or valet will destroy you but everything else is great|,Jul 22| 2019,5
Excellent location! Right next to 9/11 memorial. Views were amazing|  my room overlooked the memorial plaza. hotel was close to all the places we wanted to visit: 9/11| Battery park for Ellis Island and Statue of Liberty tour| China Town and Wall St. It was also right beside subway for getting to midtown.,Jul 12| 2019,5
This is our choice of hotels for that area.  Close to our family and good location.  Would like a “ family/friends” discount like some other local hotels.,Jul 10| 2019,5
THAT IS WAS ACROSS FROM THE 9/11 MEMORIAL AND VERY WELL CENTER GOOD LOCATION,Jul 9| 2019,5
Very nice hotel| we had a wonderful view. Very close to subway station for easy commute to mid-town. Pool was very relaxing! Staff friendly and helpful!!! We will book again here!,Jul 8| 2019,4
Improve quality of towels. Neighbors/people going to elevator are noisyHallways are drabShould always have an extra roll of toilet paperGood location near river. Never got a bellman to help us get a taxi,Jul 8| 2019,4
Great location and nice view.  The check-in process was quick and easy.,Jul 8| 2019,4
This property was excellent service and hospitality,Jul 8| 2019,5
Always enjoy my stay at this Hotel. It’s my go to when I’m in NYC.  Perfect location in Lower Manhattan,Jul 8| 2019,5
I enjoyed the view and the closeness to the Oculus and the different train stations. The only issue that I had was the refrigerators in the room were unplugged and we're not working and they smelled because of them not being plugged in. They said there was a rental fee involved if you wanted the refrigerator. It did not make sense to me that they were a mini bar and nothing was kept cold. I needed the refrigeration for medication and it took a while for them to come up and just plug it in. It was too complicated for my taste.,Jul 8| 2019,4
Close to World Trade Center is good thing.. They should have more of dining options..,Jul 6| 2019,5
You couldn't ask for a better location. The Millennium is located on the heart of lower Manhattan| just across the street form Oculus and 9/11 memorial.Connectivity is a plus| several subway stations surround the hotel; but there is also a lot of key sites a walking distance.If possible ask for a room with a view; it woth it,Jul 5| 2019,5
I booked the Junior king suite for 3 adults. The pullout sofa was more comfortable than I anticipated|  and I was told the main bed was comfortable too. We absolutely loved the views of the city and got to watch the 4th of July fireworks from our room! Everything was great including the staff!,Jul 5| 2019,5
Excellent facility| friendly/helpful staff| convenient to many subway lines| comfortable room| nice pool.,Jul 2| 2019,5
The view perfect location for night life family or just a couples trip love it I will come back,Jun 24| 2019,5
Rude front desk .. not answering phone promptly .. slow service .. smell of weed in hallways .. dirty carpet. Poor room ventilation .. 60$ for overnight parking .. I asked for microwave and was told it was an extra $35.. this was NOT in amenities.. I showed manager my email she still insisted this was the same as a roll away bed she refused to provide it without charging me ..  I would never stay here again .. they also charged me $50 for overstaying 1 hour after checkout time ..,Jun 24| 2019,2
Loved it💕💕💕💕💕😁😁😁💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕!!!!!!!!!!!,Jun 22| 2019,5
Will never come back to this hotel,Jun 17| 2019,2
The staff was very racist towards me.,Jun 17| 2019,3
Everything is badass i love it cant wait to go again,Jun 17| 2019,5
It was supposed to be a Mommy & Me trip. When your 7yr old says| “Mommy this the worst room ever!”| you know it’s bad. She’s not even a big traveler and nor doesn’t keep her own room clean.lol The room was VERY small with an odor. When I opened what I thought was a refrigerator| turned out to be a minibar that appeared old and smelled like mildew. Our television didn’t so I had to let my daughter watch her shows on my phone. Thank goodness for the other attractions in the city to keep her busy. The restaurant was not good at all. The best part was the location.,Jun 16| 2019,2

Great views| friendly staff| and excellent service!! This is honestly one of the best hotels I’ve stayed at in New York City. I’ve stayed at a lot of hotels| and this was one of the best rooms overall. They even gave us an extra umbrella since it was raining and I didn’t have one as I was leaving. Everyone was helpful & accommodating. We got recommendations about the surrounding area of downtown in terms of where to go to eat. The cleaning staff were also especially friendly.,Jun 14| 2019,5
My husband and I enjoyed our 2 day stay cation at the Millennium!   The view from our room was tremendous and the pool was a wonderful amenity.   The area around the hotel has tons of dining and shopping options and is very close to park spaces and outdoor activities.,Jun 10| 2019,5
The hotel was nice the room fairly spacious for NY hotel but the beds were hard as rocks.  That said when you walk outside to the oculus how could I really complain.,Jun 10| 2019,4
The price was right| thanks to Hotel.com| but the internet didn't work| the thermostat was not great and the minibar snacks were depleted. There’s no place to get a snack. At 9 pm| the front desk directed me to the Walgreens over a block away. Room Service is ridiculously expensive. I was going to treat myself to a bowl of ice cream. It was $10| and that was before tax and service charge. Not sure I’d stay here again.,Jun 8| 2019,3
I loved it! Right in the center of everything. Our view was outstanding on the 45th floor. We will book here again.,Jun 6| 2019,5
We had a great stay in a room with an amazing view. Friendly staff also.,Jun 4| 2019,5
Great stay overall!,Jun 3| 2019,4
The bed was very uncomfortable| the fridge was broken| not alot of information listed about the amenities in the hotel| had to call the front desk for the wifi password. We did have wonderful view from the 29th floor. The staff was very helpful and kind.,May 28| 2019,3
Excellent view of the Oculus| Freedom Tower and Hudson River. Location is great| especially since it’s close to many subway lines. My kids loved the big indoor pool| which is a real luxury for a Manhattan hotel. Room was spacious but some details were missed. The sofa bed was dated and didn’t look very clean. The sheets were already on the sofa bed when we opened it up| complete with a bloodstain on the top sheet! Carpets could also do with a thorough cleaning. Overall| a great stay| but for the price of a junior suite| I would expect clean bedding and carpets.,May 27| 2019,4
We liked the fact that it is so close to the places we wanted to see and visit . I would expect a Hilton to be clean . Our room carpet appeared dirty with lots of stains . The bathroom fan did not work and the floor was not in great shape either . The room just was shabby and I feel not very clean. This was a sold out week so changing rooms was not an option,May 27| 2019,3
Love this hotel!Best location.Breakfast buffet not great.Go to Eataly for breakfast.Yummy.,May 27| 2019,5
My kids had the best fun| the location of the hotel was superb,May 27| 2019,5
Loved this hotel and will definitely consider it again for future stays in New York| especially considering the deal I got on hotels.com.,May 27| 2019,5
I was a little worried about my choice of hotel after reading some reviews but so glad that  I stuck to my choice as it was a fantastic experience. I travelled alone for business and was thoroughly looked after - the staff were friendly and helpful and for such a huge hotel it was exceptionally well run. Really friendly lady on the bar and also those in the restaurant at breakfast. The bed was big clean and comfortable and the room quiet. Yes there is a little wear and tear but immaculate all the same. Great location with lots to see right on your doorstep. I would 100% stay there again. The views were amazing also.,May 26| 2019,5
We love the Millenium Hotel by the U.N.| it has a pool| which is amazing. Lately though we’ve liked staying downtown so this Millenium had a good price| we booked it and it too has a pool! We love this hotel| everything about it and can’t wait to return!,May 20| 2019,5
We loved our stay at the Millenium hotel. We had great views and service. It’s clean. The customer service was amazing. There were charges for items from the mini bar but it was removed since we had not used any items.,May 20| 2019,4
The view was very lovely from almost any room. However| the rooms slightly outdated .,May 19| 2019,3
The indoor pool & the staff stay and the views amazing,May 18| 2019,5
Our room was on 52nd floor. Beautiful view of the city and nice location.,May 17| 2019,4
GREAT LOCATION! THEY PUMP THIS AMAZING FRAGRANCE THROUGH THE LOBBY AND IT JUST SETS A WONDERFUL MOOD.,May 13| 2019,4
Absolutely gorgeous view I was on the 32nd floor and it was stunning! Room was alittle small but definitely felt roomy and at home. Parking was $60 dollars didn’t know about that so alittle upset but overall had an amazing stay and 10/10 recommend this hotel for your stay in New York ! Easy to find| gorgeous view| and perfect location. Was able to walk to get food and see a lot of different sites. WILL BE BACK!,May 12| 2019,5
Needs an update very old and dated!Great location and view is great rooms are old shabby! Lobby also needs an update very dated and not comfortable,Apr 30| 2019,3
Everything is good,Apr 29| 2019,5
Check in process was good| my 8 year old wanted the highest floor possible| so I asked and we were put on the 47th floor overlooking the Oculus and WTC Memorial.  It was a breathtaking view!  The room was clean| neat and comfortable.  I was however unhappy with one thing. I booked a 1 hour massage.  Per the directions on the website| I called a few hours in advance. The gentleman was very nice and was able to call back in moments and confirm that indeed the therapist would be ready for me at 330pm. I showed up at the appointed time and honestly had a fantastic massage and was so relaxed! It was however| completely ruined because as I came out| I asked the therapist where to sign (assuming I could put this on my room bill).  It was then that I was told that I was to pay the therapist directly and that I should have been told that when I booked. Moreover| they only take CASH.  So everyone has 100 cash on them all the time| right? No| I didn't.  So after my super relaxing massage| I am in a panic and have to go to my room get an ATM card| I go to the front desk and ask where the ATM is - THE CLOSEST IS A BLOCK AWAY.... After my relaxing massage| I had to walk a block| get sweaty with the massage oil clogging my pores| pay $3 foreign ATM Fee to pay the massage therapist.  None of this was her fault and I still gave her a tip. I didn't go to the front desk to complain because I just didn't want to worry with it - I wanted to go back to relaxing.,Apr 29| 2019,4
Could of been better| totally different from what was expected.,Apr 29| 2019,3
We spoke with Nikki the manager on duty regarding various things that we were unhappy with.  She took maybe $300 off our bill.  We probably spent at least $1|500 in total on our two rooms| room service and various others.  Not happy at all with the outcome.  I will definitely think twice before staying at a Hilton property again! Our room was dirty| maitress horrible shape| magazines on coffee table had old food on them| carpet stained| umbrella left in couch cushion which means no cleaning there| suite for 4+ people had only 2 glasses in entire suite| kitchenette empty-not one glass| spoon| plate. food delivered from room service was stale| tried to order morning breakfast room service| waiting 20 minutes on hold then gave up| then went to restaurant on 3rd floor where we waited 30 minutes for a toasted bagel and chocolate chips pancakes.  AND each pancake has 5 burnt chocolate chips in the middle of pancake.  AWFUL ALL AROUND. Its a shame b/c the prop is in such a special place to New Yorkers and all visitors.,Apr 29| 2019,1
Great viewCleanClose to World Trade Center building Friendly staff,Apr 29| 2019,5
Clean and great staff!,Apr 21| 2019,5
Given a great room.  Friendly and easy check in.  Great location and very clean.,Apr 21| 2019,5
BEWARE.  The Millennium Hilton Downtown REGULARLY oversells its rooms.  I arrived at 7am to check in and was told that there were no clean rooms available at that time.  I stored my luggage as requested and left for my client.  Upon returning at 10:45 pm| I was told that they were oversold -- in fact| that they KNEW they were oversold at 7am (but didn't tell me) -- and 'offered" to send me to one of their much lower-class sister hotels 15 minutes away.  The worst part (besides not being able to sleep after an exhausting day) -- the desk manager approached her offer as if it fully rectified the situation.  It was the first and last time| I'll stay at the hotel.  There are too many other fine choices in the area to have to tolerate this type of experience and behavior.,Apr 19| 2019,1
Service from the concierge and front desk was very rude in 3 instances during our interactions. Upon check in| the lady didn’t bother talking to us and just demanded our credit card and ID. Lady at the concierge ignored us and pretended to fiddle with brochures until a kind African American man came and us out. Incredibly rude service that made you feel unwelcome and wanted you to leave ASAP. Clearly they need to find another job,Apr 15| 2019,3
We love the view and the location !The room is comfy| but on the small side. Shower has very low water pressure,Apr 14| 2019,4
It was a great stay | but the young lady at the front desk wasn’t friendly or welcoming when I was checking in.,Apr 12| 2019,4
Great location if you want to be near World Trade. Very nice breakfast buffet at reasonable price. Well maintained for what looks like an older property. Rooms not sound proofed very well.  I could hear word for word conversations of guest in rooms on both sided of me coming through where the wall partitions joined the windows.  Doors slamming in the hallway| sometimes by hotel staff| could also be heard inside room.,Apr 10| 2019,4
I like the the view it was amazing. The safe was great.,Apr 8| 2019,5
My husband and I loved our junior suite| the view was spectacular! It was clean and the bed super comfortable!,Apr 8| 2019,5
The location was excellent| and very convenient. Our room was also located in a very convenient spot.,Apr 7| 2019,5
Staff at checkin not friendly at all and the guy at the bar rude,Apr 7| 2019,4
The pool is in desperate need chlorine and repairs. The mirror walls was dirty and smudged looked very nasty. My job is physically demanding was looking forward to using the steam room but was unable to because the steam room was out of order the main reason why I picked this hotel for the pool and steam room. Had two rooms next to each other one room had a tv that was very poor and snowy and the shower head was terrible. One room was clearly better than the other even though they were right next to each other. This is a famous hotel and for the price per night it should be in better shape! I wanted to have breakfast at the hotel $28 is over the top for a continental breakfast didn't bother looking at the lunch and dinner menu. I paid $6.00 for a can a coke and the sad thing is that the wholesale cost of a can of coke is $0.42| enough said. I love staying at hotels and love spending money at hotels and the only money I spent at this hotel was the $6.00 for the can of coke.,Apr 7| 2019,4
Close to everything I wanted to see.  Convenient.  Beautiful views of WTC.,Apr 4| 2019,5
The trip was wonderful the location was great right across the street from World Trade Center Memorial. Minor disappointment with the great room the television was not in HD just surprised at that but I would stay here again!,Apr 3| 2019,5
We always stay here - usually about 7 or 8 weekends a year. This time we brought two other couples. They loved it too and can see why it's the best quality and the best location.,Apr 1| 2019,5
Love it,Mar 29| 2019,5
This hotel is in a great location.  I stayed on the 26th floor facing the Freedom Tower and waterfall.  It was a beautiful view.  Check in was easy.  Room service was wonderful.  The room was a good size and in clean condition.  The only comment I have is that there were stains comforter.,Mar 27| 2019,4
Dirty stained carpets| old worn furniture| stained sheets| moldy vent in bathroom| etc...,Mar 26| 2019,2
It was amazing. View was fantastic. Price was reasonable.,Mar 25| 2019,5
Staff was great. Very helpful. Hotel looked great and room was too. I would definetly stay again,Mar 25| 2019,5
The view was AMAZING!!!!!!! Check in and Check out were quick and easy!,Mar 25| 2019,4
Awesome!,Mar 24| 2019,4
Food service was expensive for cold |bland food. No complementary WiFi. Bed was uncomfortable. Not recommended.,Mar 24| 2019,2
It was very well described so I got what I was expecting. I didn’t like the fact that there weren’t any garbage cans in the bathroom & the one in the living room was tiny. I also wish the pool hours were posted being that it says 24 hours online. Other than that| great experience.,Mar 24| 2019,5
Property was clean but no microwave in the room and there is a $35 charge if they bring one. Wasn’t sure if that was per day of a flat fee. Location of property is great in the heart of downtown Manhattan.,Mar 22| 2019,4
Everything about this hotel was beautiful - the people. the service| the location - EVERYTHING!,Mar 21| 2019,5
The location was spectacular| close to the 911 memorial| the Oculos| brooklyn bridge and battery oark where we took the ferry to Liberty Islandt. All within walking distance. The service was superb. The double beds were a bit smaller than imagined but overall wonderful place and the staff extremely helpful. We were iNew York celebrating my moms birthday so we were given a room with a very special view of the city. Breathtaking. Thank you Hilton! We will definitely be returning!,Mar 21| 2019,5
We had a room on the 40th floor with amazing views of One World Trade Center| the 9/11 Memorial and the Hudson. The location was outstanding and even though we were on vacation| there were a lot of things for us to see and do in the Financial District. With subway stations right outside the front door we had access to the entire city. As with any older hotel| there were minimal signs of wear and tear but the room was clean and modern and the staff was attentive and helpful. One thing of note is that the AC was not on since it was winter and they do not make it available in any rooms so it got a bit warm and stuffy. The front desk clerk said the only option was to have someone come up and open the windows which we did not want to do. Other than the AC the room was perfect and our stay was amazing.,Mar 20| 2019,5
Great stay at Millennium Hilton Downtown. Arrived at 11am (flight was early and wanted to leave bags at the front) but the room was ready and was allowed in straight away. Room was clean| comfortable| and had a GREAT view of WTC. I stayed for four nights and the room was cleaned every day as though I was a new guest checking in. Concierge and reception staff were very friendly. The only minor downsides were expensive WiFi| very old and pixelated television (not HD)| and not allowing to accumulate Hilton Honors points when booking through a 3rd party (booking.com was significantly cheaper for the same hotel on day of booking).Overall a great stay and would definitely stay again when next in the city for business.,Mar 19| 2019,5
A wonderful experience all around,Mar 18| 2019,5
Clean hotel. Perfect Location. I strongly recommend it .,Mar 18| 2019,5
Super fast Check-in and friendly staff| room was clean and terrific views,Mar 17| 2019,5
Comfortable stay,Mar 17| 2019,4
Our room smelt like someone was smoking weed so we called the front desk and they did move us. The next room was much cleaner and did not smell however they brought us cookies with peanuts in them after we told them our son was deathly allergic....thank god we called to check with the kitchen before giving them to our son. Overall not a bad place but it was quite a shuffle with the room and then almost ended with Eli pen and hospital if my husband hadn’t called to double check with the kitchen if there were peanuts in the cookies....,Mar 16| 2019,3
Was very much excited that hotel was across from Ground Zero| really like that| staff was great! Prompt and efficient| only thing it was one elevator working| overall wonder experience and will book again.,Mar 13| 2019,5
I loved the location of this hotel. Close to lots of metro stops so it was convenient to get anywhere we needed to go. The hotel staff was excellent. I had to request a rollaway bed and the staff was quick to respond and deliver it to my room. All of my interactions with them showed there were more than happy to help from calling a taxi to the airport to helping with my luggage.,Mar 12| 2019,5
Great location; reasonably priced; fsst elevators; spectacular view.,Mar 12| 2019,5
Will likely return. Great location for those that are interested in staying close to Battery Park| 9/11 memorial| etc. Hotel was spacious| clean. Front desk and concierge service was excellent. Some TV channels weren’t clear.,Mar 12| 2019,5
We enjoyed a stay-cation here for my fiancé’s birthday. Everything was wonderful we had a great stay!,Mar 11| 2019,5
Room was clean.  Larger than other nyc properties I have stayed in.   Had a view of 1wtc can’t beat that.  Minibar was reasonably priced for a hotel minibar.  Didn’t use most amenities the hotel offered so I can’t comment.   Check in and check out was easy.   Would stay again,Mar 11| 2019,4
They charging my card from no reason | they won’t give me my money back,Mar 10| 2019,1
No microwave or refrigerator to use and the TV didn’t have any HD channel. Love the view from the room,Mar 10| 2019,3
Hotel has an amazing view of the Freedom towers. The rooms are a bit dated but the overall value is worth it.,Mar 10| 2019,4
I chose this because of the location| views and the pool. The location was  the best in the area for winter because you can walk through the Oculus to get anywhere which really helps in the cold weather.  The architecture and experience of being at 9-11 was comforting and inspiring. They gave me the best room they had| I think| overlooking the Oculus| with a perfect view. The rooms are standard| but it is true that they need to be updated. BUT the pool was spectacular because it was 85 degrees! Most pools are a few degrees less and this made it heavenly. No one has mentioned this in any reviews. Yes| the pool area needed an update and the mirrors needed cleaning but it was huge and I was alone every day. I think kids would love it. This is the warmest indoor hotel pool I ever used.  The brunch was overpriced| but the selections were pretty good. The service was fantastic. Everyone was super cheerful and polite. One restaurant Maitre de did give me a hard time about where I wanted to sit.  I think they should put some money into this hotel because| with the location and facilities| it is potentially a gold mine.,Mar 9| 2019,4
The outside and inside of the hotel is beautiful you get the city view experience | I feel a major upgrade to the room is required | oldschool bathroom and the furniture can use an upgrade . Staff was super nice and don’t even think about moving anything in the mini bar | as soon as you move it you are paying for it so you might as well drink it .,Mar 8| 2019,4
Amazing stay thank you so much,Mar 6| 2019,5
Amazing just amazing!,Mar 5| 2019,5
The location and view were amazing| as was the room size. However| the hotel did not have free| easy to use wifi| the TVs used an old| hard to use software system| there were very few plugs for electronic devices| and the interior was a bit outdated.,Mar 5| 2019,4
Great views & value on rooms on new Years day.  due to the mass exodus that day| we couldn't get into our rooms well past the normal check in time| thus spent way to much time ( 2+ hours) waiting in the lobby to get in our room. we waited because the staff keep telling us that the room would in ready in a few minutes.....,Mar 5| 2019,4
The check in & out is very speedy. The kids enjoyed the pool.,Mar 4| 2019,4
Our room was very clean and smelled great. However we weren't pleased with the pool....that was really the only reason why I chose the hotel was for my oldest kids. It was dirty and the floors were extremely slippery. I watched two younger children fall and one actually hit his head very hard| luckily got up like a champ.,Mar 4| 2019,4
I had a junior suite reserved for weeks and once I checked in they told me they didn’t have any.,Mar 3| 2019,2
We visited the hotel for the second time| very clean| very good breakfast| very friendly and helpful staff.I highly recommendAndrej -Slovenija,Feb 27| 2019,4

Room was outdated.  Maybe they are in process of upgrading as my friends room two doors down| looked modern. Overall great hotel.,Feb 25| 2019,5
Nice location for waking up| opposite the WTC complex and with a view of the Hudson. It’s a business-focused area of course| so there isn’t too much in the way of local flavor| but a few blocks up the road has you into tribeca and some genuinely vibrant food. Hotel itself is pleasant| maybe a little too expensive for what you get (rooms and decor are slightly dated). Would recommend it.,Feb 25| 2019,4
Great| hotel. Loved the pool.Room was really hot.,Feb 25| 2019,4
Very nice. Clean. Great view of the city. Pool was cool but should have some adult hours only.,Feb 25| 2019,5
The view was outstanding and the bed was comfortable,Feb 24| 2019,4
It was a nice hotel room with great city views| however their A/C is not the best.,Feb 23| 2019,3
Hotel is in great location. The staff is great! No free continental there| but Breakfast in hotel was great!The sida couch was not comfortable| but none usually are! I will stay at this hotel again!,Feb 22| 2019,5
This is the FIRST place I'll stay if and when I go back to NYC.,Feb 20| 2019,5
The bathrooms need to be a redone the bathtub was disgusting and old and shower was rubbish.,Feb 20| 2019,3
Great view and place to stay. Right across from World Trade Center mall! Will definitely recommend,Feb 19| 2019,5
Nice hotel and perfectly situated for a visit to Manhatten.  In the Financial District| so less crowded I would say.  Great views and convenient to many things| especially 9-11 sites and much more. However| On-site restaurant very pricey and quite limited.  Desk assistants not too friendly.  Doormen where the nicest of the lot.  Had to request our rooms to be attended to| especially since we were not early risers and out of our rooms to sight see by 8:30 or so.  You all need to install ventilation fans in your bathrooms!!  In-room snacks/drinks just outrageously priced...really?!  Not a soda machine anywhere.  But| had a great view from the 21st floor.   We would stay here again.  There were only 12-13 rooms on the 21st floor - that made for a very quiet stay| which was a welcome surprise.,Feb 19| 2019,4
Internet very bad. Please get take out the mini bar. It’s useless and makes people uncomfortable. Internet was very bad. If you give free internet make sure it works.,Feb 18| 2019,3
Perfect location to visit 911 museum,Feb 18| 2019,5
It was great! Petra at the front desk was gracious and wonderful!,Feb 18| 2019,5
Stayed here for my husband’s birthday| we liked it so much we came back for Valentine’s Day weekend. We really enjoyed the indoor pool. Great to swim in the winter. The location is great!! Had a great view of One World Trade Center and Occulus.,Feb 18| 2019,4
Everything was nice|great location Would return nice pool,Feb 18| 2019,5
The hotel is very clean and the beds are superrr comfortable. The pool is beautiful and very well maintained as well. The walls are pretty thin?? Could hear sounds in the hallways coming from the rooms. The downside is that the free wifi for Hilton members is super super slow. There is an option for faster wifi but it is not free. If you’re at the higher level floors (I was at the 49th floor) you will lose service on your phone and no connection. It sucks cus then there is really not much to do if your phone has no reception. Overall| it was a nice experience| but I think I would look into other hotels because of the wifi and bad phone reception. Lovely service and cleanliness!,Feb 18| 2019,4
I liked everything the pool the room the area. The hotel is old it just needs a little more love.,Feb 18| 2019,5
This should be a flagship location for Hilton.  The rooms are very tiny and "old" feeling.  The TV service in the room was almost unwatchable.  They still have standard definition stations with a very grainy and unclear feed.  Wifi was marginal at best.,Feb 15| 2019,2
Some small trash on floor| otherwise fine.  Still think charging $13 for wifi this day/age is nuts.,Feb 8| 2019,4
Stayed for for 4 days and three nights for my son's 16th birthday. The good. Hotel is very nice| less fancy than I expected for the price but still a great place. The staff at checkin was amazing and very friendly. Hotel room was very neat| clean and bed was comfy. The location is what puts this hotel above others. From train station| restaurants and tourist attractions are all within walking distance. The bad. Our last night we barely got 4 hours of sleep because of the noise coming from room next to us. Not just loud talking but literally you could hear the furniture being moved around. Called front desk multiple times but no one picked. In the morning my wife spoke to the front desk. The gentleman stated they had sent security and they deemed the noise level appropriate. Which it was not! Worst was the guy's reaction| no apology| no empathy just a shrug of the shoulders. We will be visiting again but that last night has me possibly choosing another hotel. So again great hotel location|  just hope you get better neighbors and front desk help.,Feb 6| 2019,4
I loved having a suite because my toddler sleeps much better when I am not in the same room and there was plenty of room for us. The view from our room as great too! The crib arrived already made up. On the downside| the sofa bed wasn't made and was slanted when folded out. Also| WiFi was not free when booking through hotels.com,Feb 3| 2019,5
Wonderful as usual !,Feb 3| 2019,5
Beautiful hotel with amazing views of the city. Would recommend it to anyone.,Feb 3| 2019,5

Perfect hotel right in the middle of everything. Nice rooms great view.Will come back,Jan 29| 2019,5
We really loved the hotel and the view was amazing. One problem was that no one restocked the mini bar-when I called for them to do so and they said they would do it in the morning-outrageous yes!! I asked again and they brought up a half bottle of red-nothing else....bummer,Jan 28| 2019,5
We had a great trip.  The room with the view of the harbor was fabulous!  The hotel location was perfect as we visited the 9/11 Memorial and the WTC wall of remembrance.  We will definitily visiting again in the spring.,Jan 28| 2019,5
The hotel was amazing and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Already planning to stay there again. The only issue I had was booking through Hotels.com. Upon my arrival they advised me that there were in fact no reservations scheduled for me| even after showing them the print out from Hotel.com website. It was extremely nerve racking knowing that I may not have a room and need to find one on a last minute weekend. Not happy with hotels.com.,Jan 28| 2019,5

We had a great trip.  The room with the view of the harbor was fabulous!  The hotel location was perfect as we visited the 9/11 Memorial and the WTC wall of remembrance.  We will definitily visiting again in the spring.,Jan 28| 2019,5
The hotel was amazing and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Already planning to stay there again. The only issue I had was booking through Hotels.com. Upon my arrival they advised me that there were in fact no reservations scheduled for me| even after showing them the print out from Hotel.com website. It was extremely nerve racking knowing that I may not have a room and need to find one on a last minute weekend. Not happy with hotels.com.,Jan 28| 2019,5
I like the location| very quite and convenient. The hotel is old,Jan 21| 2019,3
Treated a 12 yr old from Texas| to a  birthday trip to NYC. The two main things he wanted to see...a 8 minute walk to Battery Park| for the ferry to the Statue of Liberty. And a 3 minute walk to the 911 museum. Perfect! The hotel staff could not have been kinder!! Helpful Concierge.  Easy access to the subway| to other sites we wanted to see. (Time Square. The Famous Carmine’s for dinner| etc) I could not have asked for a better trip. Thanks hotel.com,Jan 19| 2019,5
Location|location!!incredible views overlooking the oculus|9/11 memorial|jersey city and Hudson River. ( I  highly recomemd floor 26)Staff was friendly and very helpful. We arrived early and they got us right into our room. Pool opened at 7 am so morning swimming :)All the common areas are well kept.*The restaurant was closed for renovations but I hardly would call that a downside with all the amazing food options near by.Myself|girlfriend and 9 year old boy had a very pleasant stay and will be staying again!Cheers,Jan 16| 2019,5
It was amazing and the view was awesome as well and close to the shopping centers.,Jan 15| 2019,5
Excellent location. Steps from Oculus. Parking is expensive| we parked at a garage down the street instead. Room is adequate| a bit small| but all of NYC is.,Jan 14| 2019,4
It was located right across from World Trade Center which was nice. But the hotel isn't updated| elevator creaked and room was old and not clean,Jan 14| 2019,2
I stayed here over night and I stayed on the 9th floor and my view of the world trade building was gorgeous! The room was very clean| everything looked fairly new. Everything was great. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The only downside was that the kitchen was closed this weekend in the hotel but it did not bother me because I had dinner reservations before my broadway show. I would definitely stay here again!,Jan 14| 2019,5
I was dissapointed that there was no dining or room services available during my stay.,Jan 13| 2019,3
I was so excited to stay at this hotel because it has nice views| and usually I order take out and enjoy a nice late night meals in my hotel room| and microwave and fridge is stated as “on request”| so then when I get to the hotel| they told me I have to pay for the microwave| and when I just telling them nicely that it didn’t say that on the website| they replied with “well| now I’m telling you we’re charging it.” Those were their exact words| I was shocked how they speak to guests| and then I was like whatever| charge me then| then they said ok and hang up on me| waited for a hour| didn’t have any notice from them so we figured they probably will bring it in the room later| then when we came back after 6hrs| the room still don’t have microwave| when I called them again| they told me there was no request for microwave on my file| then I have to ask for it again. After the this experience| I just wanted to have less contact with them| super rude| the hotel view is nice| outside is nice| but inside with the room just looks old and outdated| but gladly| it was clean. Probably will never stay at this hotel anymore.,Jan 9| 2019,2
Great view!!! Hotel staff was accommodating and pleasant. Location was perfect.,Jan 8| 2019,5
The location was awesome. Checking in and out easy and fast. Big room,Jan 8| 2019,5
Overall nice hotel in a great area.  Needs some updating.  Beds were comfortable.  Had a corner junior king suite| great views.,Jan 8| 2019,4
Absolutely love this hotel,Jan 7| 2019,4
Great location. Spectacular view of the of the city. Super friendly staff.,Jan 7| 2019,5
Loved my getaway| just wish the hotel bed and pillows were a little more comfortable. The staff was amazing and was such a nice time.,Jan 7| 2019,5
I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel and the location was perfect to get to anything/anywhere I needed to get to .... I celebrated my birthday.,Jan 7| 2019,5
Very nice hotel with very professional staff!Thank you!,Jan 5| 2019,5
When paying for 2 day stay just to check in at 9am to 3pm one can only feel they’ve been duped.,Jan 5| 2019,3
Hotel was great| close to subway and shopping and World Trade Center. Staff very pleasant. And hotel restaurant was ideal. 10/10,Dec 31| 2018,4
Clean| spacious room and the staff was excellent and friendly. A wonderful experience.,Dec 29| 2018,5
Carpet in our room definitely needs to be replaced. More Lighting in the elevator waiting area in lobby.,Dec 28| 2018,4
This is our 4th or 5th time staying here| as we have kids and grandkids close by.  Great location for us w/Occulus so close even when weather is bad you can get far thru “O” and Brookfield Place.,Dec 28| 2018,5
Great location| great price| the bathroom need better cleaning,Dec 26| 2018,4
Had no microwave| tv was bad | the bathroom wasn’t as clean as I would’ve liked it,Dec 26| 2018,3
Comfortable room with a great view of the WTC and Oculus in a convenient location at a reasonable price.,Dec 25| 2018,5
Nice view and locationAcross from mall Clean and comfortable nice service,Dec 25| 2018,5
Staff and cleanliness is great however| the property needs some updates.  Carpet is old and shower head was leaking from handle part.,Dec 25| 2018,4
I had a view of the world trade center from the 10th and it was amazing. You look out your window and you can see all of the hustle and bustle of NYC. There are plenty of shopping places near by and subway entrances. Times Square is a quick subway ride away! The service at the hotel was amazing until checkout. The man at the front desk was a little snippy with us when I asked why I was over charged $100. Apparently there was a safety deposit fee| yet my receipt from the hotel did not state that so it was slightly confusing also no one informed me of this at check in but it was no huge deal. Also if your employees are going to have attitudes they shouldn’t work at the front desk until they have a better attitude with paying guest who are there to have a good time.,Dec 25| 2018,5
I thought it was great!! The location is amazing and the hotel is nice!,Dec 23| 2018,5
We had a terrific stay. Our hotel room was spacious and immaculate. It overlooked the memorial which is a beautiful structure. Great location; easy to get uptown on the subway. We would definitely stay there again.,Dec 23| 2018,5
Last minute hotel booking. Reasonably priced. Doorman at main entrance wouldn’t hold door open or help with bags. Front desk had 4 people with 1 helping customers we had to ask for helps,Dec 22| 2018,3
Great location right next to metro station| World trade center and lots of activities to do. The hotel could use little upgrade especially being a Hilton.,Dec 19| 2018,4
Very poor customer service| very rude check in staff members.,Dec 17| 2018,1
Beautiful hotel overall. Was very disappointed in the customer service. Our room was boiling hot and we couldn’t adjust the temperature. The front desk told us there was nothing they could do about it because the whole building was being heated. We slept basically sweating the whole night. Then| we ordered food to be delivered and they forgot to give us utensils. Again| the front told us they don’t provide or give utensils out. They have a full restaurant during normal hours. Was disappointed by the lack of accommodation.,Dec 17| 2018,3
Overpriced needs a lot of win terms of updates. The front desk and customer service can’t agree on anything. Management needs to step it up.,Dec 10| 2018,2
Employees aren’t very knowledgeable at the check in,Dec 9| 2018,4
I was not allowed into our room| after having arrived late at night| because something was wrong in their system and my name wasn't on the room appropriately.  They handled this horribly and I had to wait and speak to several people before it was sorted out.,Dec 4| 2018,1
The room itself was fine. However| the Jim was very small and lacking. Also| the subway system is being repaired on weekends which makes travel to and from the hotel very difficult.,Dec 3| 2018,3
One of the best locations in NYC. Great view of the Oculus and the river.,Dec 3| 2018,5
Overall stay was pretty good. Your room service prices are a bit extreme however. That’s why I went down a level on my ratings.,Nov 29| 2018,4
Lovely room| perfect views of the wtc. Just wish parking garage had in/out privileges| and pool was heated more.. Otherwise had a great stay.,Nov 26| 2018,5
Nice hotel in a fantastic location! Steps from literally every subway line. Rooms are clean though small. Staff not super friendly but may just be the NYC attitude?,Nov 26| 2018,4
the Beds are to small for two adults| out dated rooms,Nov 26| 2018,3
33rd floor room amazing views ate  in the restaurant and it was lovely. The gym was good too. The bar staff were excellent especially Amy. Very local and close to subway.,Nov 25| 2018,5
Fantastic view of oculas & freedom tower (one world tower)! Quiet room. 2 TVs.  Greet staff.,Nov 24| 2018,5
Exceptional overall experience. Convenient| great location with terrific service! A bonus was the convenient and low cost garage location.,Nov 23| 2018,5
Hotel rooms are on the large size for NY. Location is very good and close to subway system. The hotel overall is starting to show a bit of age and you can hear when someone is showering or flushing toilet. But for the price it’s a good deal.,Nov 21| 2018,4
Excellent location| friendly and helpful staff. Only down side is the pool area is in need of up dating.,Nov 21| 2018,4
The check-in could have been warmer. I’ve stayed in this hotel before and this time the check-in processs left a lot to be desired in terms of friendliness and hospitality. The room is starting to show it’s age and there used to be an arm chair by the window which was missing. Housekeeping didn’t come during my stay.,Nov 21| 2018,4
Nice hotel | great location| right next to subway. friendly staff. Second time staying here would recommend. Hotel restaurant food is good too. Had dinner a couple of nights and was very good and reasonably priced.,Nov 20| 2018,5
The hospitality was truly remarkable impeccable service from the restaurant bartender Manuel| to housekeeping at your beckoned call| would gladly return😄,Nov 19| 2018,5
I got t o the hotel and they said “we have you for one night”. I showed them my hotels.com receipt for 4 nights. It turned out they also had a second reservation in my name for three nights starting on night one. They kept blaming it on hotels.com even though I had a receipt showing 4 nights. They eventually straightened it out.,Nov 17| 2018,3
Nice room.  Great location,Nov 17| 2018,5
Perfect location| exquisite view. Concierge was very nice. Elevators were fast.,Nov 13| 2018,4
Took a break from the suburbs to spend a long weekend in NYC with my wife now that we are empty nesters.  Indoor pool was a nice touch on cold November days.  Overall| no complaints.,Nov 11| 2018,4
Fantastic downtown location| but needs some renovation and updating. Breakfast menu could use some variety tol,Nov 10| 2018,4
The carpet was filthy| was afraid to take off our shoes. beautiful view of the river,Nov 5| 2018,4
Excellent location -  Across from 911 memorial. Friendly staff.  Selected hotel from internet and AARP.  Had no clue what I was getting.  What a pleasant surprise.,Nov 5| 2018,5
Great location| clean room. Front desk a little under staffed for check in time,Oct 29| 2018,5
Size of the room| location to sites and attractions,Oct 29| 2018,5
Right next to the oculus and world trade center. Indoor pool nice for kids in cooler weather,Oct 23| 2018,4
Nice hotel with beautiful views. The carpet and sofa were dirty. Privacy/noise issue. Other than that amazing and an ideal location to be in Manhattan.,Oct 21| 2018,5
Great hotel next to Ground Zero.  Only downside is it's a bit rundown/dated.  Room was a great size for NYC| but sofa bed was tiny and practically impossible to sleep on. Outside of that| great location and walk-able to the Financial District| Staten Island Ferry| and other lower Manhattan attractions.,Oct 17| 2018,3
Wonderful location. We’ve stayed her before. Unfortunately| we had to switch rooms a few times due to moldy smell 😞 They definitely are in need of a remodel..,Oct 1| 2018,3
Great location - across the street from WTC and Oculous - easy subway access,Sep 30| 2018,4
No tv unless you pay for it. That’s rediculous for such high priced rooms.,Sep 30| 2018,3
The junior suite is a terrible configuration. Definitely not worth the money. The service at the hotel restaurant could not be worse. (Dirty water glasses and cutlery| surly and rude staff) Terrible WiFi.,Sep 25| 2018,2
The service was great. We were there for a staycation. The room had an amazing view of the Hudson river and World Trade Center site.,Sep 22| 2018,5
Great room| staff was fantastic and very friendly.,Sep 18| 2018,5
I booked a deluxe King room but when we checked in at 10:00 pm that day and they gave us an assessable room without telling us until I realised.  They are not honest and should have told us when no more room I requested.  Then I requested two double room they finally gave us to move.  Bad service!,Sep 14| 2018,3
Wonderful stay| great location| friendly and helpful staff. Rooms are very comfortable.,Sep 11| 2018,5
Small rooms|  dated hallways|  etc. Nice view|  overpriced valet.,Sep 8| 2018,3
Good location for Lower Manhattan| room size is big and best view by window,Sep 8| 2018,5
It is a very nice place to stay. It is convenient to World Trade Center| shopping| donning and an easy subway ride to Time Square. The staff is very nice and helpful. It is nicely decorated and very clean.,Sep 8| 2018,5
The hotel room was bigger than most in NYC| which was great. The TV had some issues as the reception on all TVs there is bad apparently. That needs to be addressed. Also| there was a plumbing issue so the faucet made a loud and terrible noise when you first turned on the cold water in the bathroom. Other than those couple of minor issues| the staff was nice| the location was great| and they were very nice to let us leave our bags there before check-in and after checkout| free of charge.,Sep 7| 2018,4
Good for the weekend price.  Mattress had dips in it which made it uncomfortable.  Other than that| room was very clean and in good location downtown across from World Trade.  Also close to Subway stations.,Sep 5| 2018,4
Perfect location| quiet room. Would definitely come back again.,Sep 5| 2018,5
Nice hotel| nice view| next to World Trade Center.,Sep 4| 2018,5
Needs to be refreshed......the facilities and decor suck!,Sep 3| 2018,3
Amazing. Great view and very clean.,Sep 1| 2018,5
Overall it was great.  I was annoyed that wifi was not included.  It was difficult to access the free wifi in public spaces.  Everyone was welcoming and friendly.,Sep 1| 2018,4
The rooms and facilities are a little dated. But the hotel benefits from its location and the development of the immediately surrounding area. I usually chose to stay uptown in more modern and costlier hotels| but this time I decided to try something different. For a lot less $ I was able to get a corner room with a great view of the city and a top floor. There is great shopping and eating all around the hotel within easy walking distance. Recommend Le District| Eataly| all the places on the water| and shopping at the oculus| located across the street from the hotel.,Aug 31| 2018,5
Great hotel and great location! Of course| it is very expensive like everything in NYC. Swimming pool is great as well.,Aug 30| 2018,5
Nothing but great things to say about this hotel.,Aug 27| 2018,4
The property is in a very touristy location. The staff was great| especially Petra!,Aug 27| 2018,4
Great location. In the hub of things but quiet enough for sleeping. Staff couldn’t do enough for us. Confusing what was free in the room needed to get clarification. Crazy to look over the 9/11 memorial every day. Easy for Subways. Room could do with updating but clean and comfortable. Prices were reasonable. Breakfast on the expensive side. So we ate out.,Aug 26| 2018,5
This is the first time we stayed in this hotel. It is worth the price and the view was so womderful. Everytime i opened the curtain i can see ground zero| the world trade center| the river. It was stunning view. I hope to get the same view when we come back again.,Aug 26| 2018,5
Nice Hotel| close to the 911 Memorial| Trinity and St Paul Churches| conveinent to Battery Park.,Aug 24| 2018,5
The hotel was amazing! When we arrived at the hotel around 11 AM hoping that we would be able to leave our bags there since we had just flown in that morning and to our surprise our room was ready. It was exceptionally clean| the view was spectacular and the customer service was great. We would love to stay here again. It really made our trip even better.,Aug 24| 2018,5
Room was comfortable| brilliant views| good location| subway nearby. Pool really needs an upgrade.,Aug 24| 2018,4
The perfect location. The beds are comfortable and the room is a decent size| however they could use some renovating such as the carpet and television but aside from that| it is beautiful with fantastic views and within a short walk to all of your necessities as well as fun activities. The snacks range from $5-9 usd.,Aug 22| 2018,4
It was pleasant stay! Location of the hotel is the best part. Little inconvenience with bathroom freshness but overall good stay. Best hotel at this price for staying in downtown. We woke up looking at WTC every day from our room window.,Aug 22| 2018,4
Nice hotel close to Restaurants and 911 memorial .,Aug 22| 2018,5
Great front desk person and bell hop staff very helpful and attentive rooms were comfy and clean,Aug 20| 2018,5
Great downtown location. Across from World Trade Center; close to Wall St and Chinatown.  A number of subway lines mere steps away. I would stay here again.,Aug 20| 2018,4
I chose this hotel since my brother would be staying and touring NYC for two nights only.  The hotel needed to be the most accessible| close to the best NYC attractions with a very competitive rate!  And these are all true for the Millenium Hotel in downtown.  The hotel is located in front of the Oculus| few steps from the 9/11 Memorial and walking distance to the Battery Park.  I also got very good rate during our stay!The lobby is nice with bar at the corner.  We did not get a chance to check the other facilities.  The room is a good size| we upgraded to two double beds.  It a little bit outdated and there were showing of wear and tear in the room itself.  There was also a funny smell in the room which we were able to resolve by spraying the room with our perfume. They told my brother it’s the bathroom cleaner scent.  All in all it was a pleasant stay aside from the smell.  The location is great!  I will consider to stay again in th future.,Aug 19| 2018,4
The room we booked was not available the staff went above and beyond accommodating us with a better view and free breakfast int he morning.  Easily one of the best hotel staff have ever come across| and this hotel is in a great location.   We will be staying here again with no hesitation.,Aug 19| 2018,5
I've stayed there for 4 nights. Location was really good| close to Subway station. 911 museum just across from the hotel| and shopping malls are within walking distance.Staffs were friendly. Slippers were not provided and refrigerator was broken. View from the room was fantastic| perfect location to enjoy the firework on the independence day.,Aug 2| 2021,4

El lugar esta super bien ubicado| con fácil acceso a diferentes lineas de Metro| y lugares turísticos. La opción de la habitación y la vista que seleccione supero mis expectativas. Me he quedado en diferentes hoteles de la cadena Hilton| y el personal siempre es muy amable. Pero aquí es mas frio y serio. Por algún motivo un día no realizaron la limpieza del la habitación| por lo que tuvimos que estar pidiendo que la realizarán el resto de los días. Por algún motivo la camarista nos tocaba a las 8 am para hacer la habitación| evidentemente a esa hora aun no estábamos listos para salir y pareciera que esta situación le molestaba  y decidió no hacer más la limpieza de habitación.Pero en aun así la pasamos muy bien.,May 15| 2021,4
Buena ubicación. Excelente vista. Buena suite. Limpieza poca por COVID.,Apr 11| 2021,4

El hotel muy buen ubicado al frente De la Torre 1 del WTC. Es difícil calificar los servicios este momento de pandemia porque todo esta cerrado pero en general todo funciona.Lo lamentable es que ofrecen estacionamiento pero al final te indican donde están los estacionamientos públicos que no son cerca.,Mar 31| 2021,4
El hotel está muy bien ubicado | pero si recomendamos que mejoren la limpieza de la carpeta | lo demás estaba limpio igual las camas cómoda pero el olor q se siente muy fuerte es la carpeta q necesita de limpieza profunda . Muchas gracias .,Mar 18| 2021,4
Oda çok kötüydü. Asansör çalışmıyordu. Uzun süre asanörün yapılması beklenildi. 30 kat aşağı merdivenlerden insanlar yürümek zorunda kaldı. Daha öncede bu otelde kalmıştım ama hiç bu kadar kötü bir konaklama yaşamamıştım.,Mar 15| 2021,1

部屋が角部屋だったので、夜景が素晴らしかった。ダブルベッド×2台の部屋でしたが、中学生男子2人で1台のベットに寝るには狭かったです。屋内プールがあったのでよかったが、夜9:45までで利用ができなくなるのは少し早すぎた気がします。場所も便利でよかったです。,Jan 9| 2020,5
Por ser um hotel da rede Hilton deixa muito a desejar. A única vantagem é a localização e pelo fato de ser um edifício alto ficamos no 53 andar vista linda.Fácil acesso ao metro. Muitas opções de linhas em frente ao hotel.No entanto a limpeza deixa a desejar muita poeira| o quarto o tamanho é bom no entanto antigo não tem tomadas próximas às cabeceiras das camas. Precisa de uma renovação.Encontramos durante a estadia peças de roupas de outros hospedes atrás das cortinas.A estadia de 7 dias neste hotel foi parte de uma viagem de 18 dias nos Eua todos os hoteis reservados pelo hoteis.com e este foi o que menos me agradou. Existia toda a expectativa por ser um hotel Hilton. Mas não passa de um simples hotel. Decepcionante,Jan 7| 2020,3
Me gusta todo de este hotel| sus instalaciones| su ubicación| la piscina| es todo perfecto. Me alojó en él desde hace años y siempre repito ya que es una grata experiencia.,Jan 7| 2020,4
Posizione perfetta| anche per varie linee della metro che convergono di fronte all'hotel. La struttura ha veramente bisogno di una rinfrescata per quanto riguarda l'arredamento.Colazione buona ma con una scelta di cibo minore a quella  di altri Hilton che ho provato. Personale gentile ma molto distaccato.,Jan 3| 2020,3
La localisation (juste en face du world trade center| à proximité du pont de Brooklyn| avec un large choix de lignes de métro) et le bon rapport qualité/prix de l'hôtel.,Jan 1| 2020,4
Die Lage ist überragend sowie auch das gesamte Ambiente,Dec 28| 2019,5
À part l'emplacement| ce séjour dans cet hôtel a été une mauvaise expérience. Une première pour ma conjointe et moi dans un Hilton| et très probablement la dernière. En général| l'état de l'hôtel est vieillissant et laisse à désirer pour un 4 étoiles. En particulier| l'accueil est peu courtois et pas du tout chaleureux. Mais surtout| la chambre n'était pas très propre (poussière sur les plaintes| tâches suspectes sur le sommier....). Je déconseille fortement cet hôtel| et recommandé de revoir la décoration pour quelque chose de plus "millenium" et pas 80's.,Dec 27| 2019,2
Das Hotel ist etwas in die Jahre gekommen.Aber der Ausblick entschädigt für alles. Der Service war sehr gut.Trotz der Größe des Hotels war es sehr ruhig.Sehr viele Subwaystationen in der Nähe.,Dec 23| 2019,5

C’est difficile d’avoir accès à notre véhicule lorsqu’il est stationné à l’hôtel. Le départ a été déplaisant...Les concierges offrent un service remarquable et super courtois!,Oct 13| 2019,3
Expérience qui n’est pas a la hauteur du prix payé,Oct 7| 2019,1
Nice hotel with helpful staff. Breakfast around 30 dollars but very standard menu,Oct 3| 2019,4
Hele goede ligging. Aardig personeel. Kamers gedateerd. Mooi uitzicht vanaf 20ste verdieping.,Aug 29| 2019,4
La vue de la chambre| la situation de l’hôtel| le personnel très sympathiqueMais moquette chambre pas très propre déco vieillotte,Aug 21| 2019,3
Hôtel situé dans le quartier financier ; très belle vue sur Ground zéro et le port de Brookfield de l’Hudson. Quartier animé le jour et très calme le soir. Hôtel un peu vieillot avec chambre et literie satisfaisantes| mais au décor à rénover. Très bien pour une ou deux nuits pour découvrir ce quartier mais sinon il serait plus judiciaire de choisir un hôtel dans le Midtown pour profiter de tous les avantages de cette ville. Personnel souriant et accueillant.,Aug 20| 2019,4
great location| most of ny spits are within walking distance,Aug 17| 2019,5
맨하튼 남쪽에 위치한 호텔로 고층 전망이 상당히 좋습니다. 정면에서는 911메모리얼 조형물과 건너편 저지시티가 한 눈에 보이고 측면에는 미드타운 쪽 경치가 펼쳐집니다. 제 숙소 쪽은 아니었지만 엘리베이터가 있는 쪽 방향은 브루클린교가 한눈에 보이기도 하구요. 돈을 좀 더 들이더라도 뷰 좋은 객실을 선택하신다면 후회 없을 것입니다. 그리고 특히 더 인상적이었던 건 이 호텔이 century 21 바로 옆건물에 위치해 있다는 것입니다. 뉴욕이 첫 방문이 아니신 분이라면| 쇼핑에 중점을 둔 분이라면 이 호텔 추천합니다. 소호도 차로 10분거리여서 만족스럽구요. Century21은.발품 안팔고 가성비 오진 쇼핑하기엔 최고인듯 합니다. 덕분에 원없이 쇼핑하고 돌아갔습니다. ^^,Aug 12| 2019,5

Having stayed many times in Millennium Hilton ONE UN| we wanted to try to live in another Manhattan area| but this hotel was a major disappointment and is way overpriced compared to the value of the room and poor service you get as a guest.Pros:Great location right next to WTC and Oculus| and close to Brooklyn Bridge| SI ferry and Wall StreetLots of public transportation optionsSpacious roomsCons:Terrible cleaning. We had to ask for our room to be cleaned upon arrival. But even thereafter we had to inform again of the massive dust still present on the bathroom lampsThe room was modern 25 years ago. Busted old furniture and carpets in dire need of replacementAlmost unfriendly hotel reception staff. Not once in our one week stay were we greeted with a smile or “hello”. The staff seemed burned out and in need of some customer mindset trainingWe will chose another next time we go to NYC and can’t recommend this hotel| unfortunately.,Apr 23| 2019,2
Environnement très beau mais pas pratique pour sortir le soirPersonnel parfait en tout pointPiscine avec une eau douteuse et pas de transat comme sur la photo.,Apr 18| 2019,3
Заселили быстро| дали 32 этаж с видом на Мемориал 9/11 и пролив; а также гостевой купон на вайфай. Вид шикарный| особенно когда солнышко) Рядом Сентури 21| ради него я здесь и остановилась))) Метро совсем в двух шагах| удобно ехать в аэропорт. Кровать удобная| все работало| все было ок),Mar 25| 2019,5
Très bien situé| personnel agréableEquipement un peu vieillissant,Mar 25| 2019,4
Ikke det beste hotellet på rengjøring og standard. Ikke som på bildene. Åpnet kjøleskapet og her var det muggete og luktet oppkast. Sa ifra 3 ganger om det men ikke noe ble gjort. Passer ikke for de med astma da det er tepoe på rommet som ikke er godt rengjort. Fikk ikke noe info om fasiliteter på hotellet. Det eneste som var positivt er beliggenheten som er helt topp. Men hadde da valgt et annet hotell i området for en ny tur. Dette trenger oppdatering på mye.,Feb 23| 2019,1
Great location| ok rooms. There are not a lot of restaurants nearby but you are just above the subway so everything is easily accessible!,Feb 22| 2019,5
Super opplevelse,Feb 18| 2019,5
방휴지통에 전 손님이 먹다버린  콜라가 그대로 있었으며  체크인할때 불친절로 체크인하면서부터  기분이 나빠짐,Feb 12| 2019,3
