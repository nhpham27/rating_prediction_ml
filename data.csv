Close to the airport makes traveling easy.  Staff was friendly.,1
Disgusting Hotel !! I do not recommend! DIRTY DUST EVERYWHERE| OLD FURTHERING| PARKING FEE PER DAY . This is unbelievable PRICE IS RIDICULOUS AS WELL $200 for 1 NIGHT ! Disgusting,0
Hotel was in very bad condition.  Old decor to include old wood paneling with glitter and popcorn ceilings.  The bathtub was painted yellow (years ago I'm sure) and the paint was chipping.  It also over flowed when we showered.  The bed was a little comfy even with the 1980's leather headboard but other than that it was not a good stay.,0
Stay for a night,1
First of all you have an option to park in the lot or garage but dont expect to find a spot in either. After circling around for over 30 minutes i found a spot on the 3rd floor of the garage only to learn there is no elevator so carrying heavy luggage down stairs and in the rain for $24 is just ridiculous.  The bathrooms were gross and need to be updated in the wost way| you know its bad when you feel dirty after a shower because there is mold everywhere...Lastly the AC didn't work and the front desk was unhelpful as well as unsympathetic.,0
Staff was extra friendly when i checked in even upgraded my room,1
We had an amazing stay the staff was very friendly and helpful.,1
I spent 3 night here Mgmt telling me there is no housekeeping? I speak to house keeping they said yes they do housekeeping. No pool the whole weekend. No refrigerator in room furniture and walls with dents in them all over this is hilton and it looks like Filton?  Prices of foood was expensive and laundromats was a maze to find and in the gym ?,0
I like everything service room clean room,1
The property advertised that it had an indoor pool| i specifically booked this hotel so I could entertain my 2 children the evening before an early morning flight.  Upon attempting to enter the pool I discovered it was locked.  I inquired at the front desk and they told me it had been closed for months.  The front desk staff was rude when I expressed my disappointment.,0
Convenient to airport| shuttle to airport gets very crowded in the a.m. May want to run 2 during oeak hours. Almost wasn't able to board.Room abit unclean but manageable,1
Location and convenience of the shuttles,1
I didn't like that parking was charged separately,1
Easy access to airport,1
Very relaxing short getaway. Clean comfortable safe environment. Friendly staff. Could not as for more on a basic level. Very comfortable beds.,1
Very busy place. Not much staff around to ask questions. Clean| quiet| convenient.,1
Convenient to airport with shuttle| with large clean and quiet room. Bed and linens 5-star.,1
Bed very comfortable.Staff very professional and pleasant.  No microwave or refrigerator. Parking is $24. and $18,1
Convenience/proximity to airport was primary reason for staying here.  Did not use any of the amenities.  Hotel itself was nice and clean and staff were friendly.  Shuttle to airport was not the greatest| but it worked out fine.,1
Check in was nice ..fast and made sure i was great,1
Great Service,1
I choose this room for its amenities. None where actually available| I was not made aware until AFTER a deposit was taken.,0
old and very dated facility: the bathroom is dated with only shower curtain; no exhaust fan in the bathroom at all; the a/c control is not functioning in the room; parking is always full to the capacity.,0
We felt safe at this hotel. It was close to the airport for shuttle and for car rentals. The room was adequate and beds comfortable for sleeping. The accommodations met our needs. The hotel is in need of some sprucing up in some areas. We checked out the bar and drinks were expensive for a cocktail snd draft beer. Hotel has a restaurant and Starbucks coffee is brewed. We chose this due to better reviews than other places nearby.,1
Everything was great housekeeping was very nice & the bartender at the restaurant downstairs made me feel at home.,1
Melissa at the front desk and Raul as a server were great! Very friendly| polite| and acceptable!,1
Everything!,1
Everything was good,1
Parking fees to costly | not so clean . Lack of Valet's services .,1
I didn't like the noise. People were loud until 3am and in the morning too.,1
Proximity to airport|  the shuttle service to and from airport was nice even thiugh there was a lot of crowed. The drivers managed to calm everyone and letting them know there is more buses coming.,1
The Property itself was decent.  Nice bar/restaurant area.  The Parking was expensive.  The staff was not helpful and seemed overwhelmed.  WiFi did not work.  The beds were Not comfortable.  The cleaning staff was very good.  limited channels on TV.  Will not stay here again.,0
Nothing,1
Parking is very convenient to the airport. Nice staff.,1
Hiltons system is not in sync with expedia. i had to wait for 2hours before my room was confirmed,0
The loud group in the next room didn't quiet down till after 2am. I needed to catch the 5am shuttle to the airport so not well rested to travel. My shower had long black hairs on the walls and being a blonde I was sorely disappointed.,0
Overall okay. In-room amenities were sparse. Text message after check-in was friendly. Contactless check out was easy! Only complaint is the parking garage. Overly expensive and the ticket reader at the exit is poorly set up and did not work.,1
I didnt like that I had to pay for parking,1
Bar did not stay open long enough,1
Must have the loud floor because both kids and parents were slamming doors| talking extremely loud in the hallways all hours if the night and their kids were running up and Finn the hallway continuously all night. Never going back,0
"I woke up to a distant view of NYC and loved it. The shop was a tad smaller than I thought and was not a fan of the ""community"" microwave. The bed is amazing (my loking). Had a burger from the bar| I didn't mind the price but it was big enough to feed 2. I was here for only 1 night (12hr layover to Savannah) but overall very pleased.",1
Not able to shower broken bathroom pipe,0
Bathroom was old and felt like dirty. Shower had was not working properly.,0
Did not meet Hilton standards. Had a non smoking room but my room smelled like cigarettes. Could have spent less elsewhere and had a much better stay.,0
I stayed overnight for a flight. The hotel provided good service and value,1
Check in was easy ! Room was clean.,1
Great front desk managerCouldn't be more helpful J,1
Place was truly amazing loved every bit of it and the VIEW was beautiful,1
The room was unclean I woke up with rashes all over,0
Is a good hotel but should let people know before hand that they need to pay for parking otherwise it was an excellent spot .,1
Loved the hotel| was very clean and staff was very friendly. The room was nice and big on inside. Will stay again when I'm in NJ,1
Clean and neat the ewr airport| staff are courteous and clean,1
Loved it!! Had a very nice time there with my fianc√©,1
Free breakfast would have been great.  Checkin was smooth.  Simple.  Very courteous and helpful.  Great customer service,1
Horrible | do not book here. Hallways smells like smoke and dirty .  Room wasn't clean either,0
The Room was fine . The shuttle was great. The people were very nice.,1
Excellent room great service | will be back soon as ASAP,1
Wait wasn't too long. Great location,1
Property was dated and in need of a major renovation,0
SO very helpful and accommodating during the pandemic crisis| couldn't have been nicer!,1
Nice place to stay for a couple days| relaxing. Definitely recommend...,1
Pretty good y'all need to upgrade ur TVs to smart TVs every other hotel has them,1
The Bedding was amazing.  Most comfortable mattress and pillows.  So much so| that I would love to know what type of mattress this is and what type of pillows they use so I can duplicate in my home.,1
Amazing stay! Beautiful hotel ana awesome customer service. The only dislike was no hot tub and very slippery tiles around pool.,1
The beds are SO comfortable.  It's an older property| but well maintained.,1
Staff where very helpful and friendly. Room was comfortable and the cleaning staff for room 417 on my visits where amazing. They could not do enough for me.,1
Terrible you have to pay for the parking additional and we don't have breakfast| I am well diagnosed with the reservation here at E Hilton hotel| a hotel with prestige and the service so bad and the people who are in the reception of the worst I definitely do NOT recommend it to anyone,0
Location is between 2 major highways. Very noisy outside.,1
Staff was super amazing from the minute we walked in. Rooms were super clean. Everything was great except parking. But overall Very happy with our stay,1
Room was clean| however there was no place to purchase a drink after we returned from a concert. We assumed there would be a vending machine| however none was found.,1
Very clean and comfortable beds! Front desk service was amazing!,1
I liked how clean everything was. The staff at the front desk were very nice and helpful.,1
Decent room. No movies on TV. Nice bar and the food looked good| lots of people eating at the bar. Breakfast quite expensive unless you get the all inclusive deal. We left our car there for the week at a reasonable price.,1
"Great location near the airport.  Maybe it's just NJ (and I'm from the Midwest)| but food and beverage prices were ""high"" in my humble opinion - $15 for a margarita| $23 for the breakfast buffet...",1
"It is a nice hotel to ""pass by""| but nothing to do around. No real other option for eating other than the (good but pricey) in house restaurant/pub.",1
The only things I can said is the parking is a nightmare. Is hard to found parking.,1
This property is very outdated and the heating system sucks!,0
Super close location to Liberty EWR.  Friendly staff and clean room.  Room temperature difficult to control.  Heater does not work.,1
Clean| large and comfortable room.  Quiet. Good restaurant.,1
Close to airport so much less of a hassle.Restaurant on premises  is a plus .,1
This hotel is close to airport and complementary shuttle.,1
Clean| modern and comfy bed. I highly recommend for Newark Airport stay.,1
Do not like paying for parking. Easy access to airport. Nice property| exceptionally clean. Especially appreciate front desk staff who were very friendly and more than efficient.,1
The hotel was very nice.  I found the employees lacking in friendliness.We arrived early morning and our room was ready which was very nice.The check in person was not very friendly and other employees when we asked questions were not very friendly but I would stay there again.  The beds were very comfortable.,1
Missed flight due to weather - stayed at airport.  Free airport shuttle. Great location - and restaurant (very convenient).,1
The only property in the area that charges excruciating parking rates for guests.  All other hotels in the area do not charge for parking except the Hilton. Terrible location. No quality restaurants in the area. No  microwave oven and the refrigerator was actually a freezer because everything we put in it froze. This property should not be wearing the Hilton name.,0
Only the shuttle experience was unpleasant... for one| not enough seats on the shuttle bus on the way TO the hotel (after a very long wait to begin with)| and not enough seats on the shuttle bus on the way back to the airport the next morning. Also| a completely chaotic shuttle boarding system even at the hotel in the morning (where it could easily be properly organized)... if you carry luggage| you are less likely to make it on the bus because those with small items can enter the bus even if you arrived at the stop first and lined up to put your luggage in the back of the shuttle.,1
Easy and quick from airport. great shuttle service. No business center. Not close to office supply store to get printing done.  Not close to outside restaurants.,1
Didn't like the fact that there was a parking fee!,1
Shower had hair all over in it and the rims of the toilet so the maids need to clean better other than that everything was fine!,1
Stay was good trying to contact your desk from outside facility to inquire about shuttle was brutal.,1
Hotel lobby was warm and festive for the holiday| and staff was very friendly. Room was clean and quite comfortable. Enjoyable stay overall.,1
I never made it to the hotel as I missed my connecting flight and I was unable to get a refund or credit on the room so I am totally disappointed and wasted a significant amount of money.,0
Hotel showing signs of age. Service in restaurant slow and haphazard,1
Everything was great. Friendly staff,1
Not enough parking.  On-site car rental has limited hours.Shuttle to and from Newark Airport was convenient.Rooms were clean.,1
Lovely hotel| great food at the restaurant. The staff were wonderfully helpful and cheerful! We are coming back in April and will definitely stay here again.,1
Cleanliness and service. The room was pretty big| the bathroom spacious. People behind the desk were friendly. They have a very efficient airport pickup system every twenty minutes.  I would  definitely recommend Airport Hilton and stay there in future,1
We stayed the night before a flight.  Shuttle service to and from the airport was as advertised (timing).  Reception was polite and professional‚Äîeven gave us a late checkout (sore subject as I called in a couple weeks in advance to arrange a late checkout and it was not noted in the reservation).  One of my pet peeves are hotels that use a flat sheet on the bottom (if you roll around like I do it inevitably comes untucked).  Yes| they use the flat sheets on the bottom.  The corridors are a wee bit beaten up.  But the hotel was clean.  Oh| and the in room coffee was actually rather good.  So the ultimate question-would I stay there again?  Probably.  If I get a good deal| yes.  If not no...,1
Booked a King Bedroom and once I arrived I was told that the King Rooms were sold out and given away on a first come first serve basis. I was upset as I had reserved and pre-paid for a King Bedroom and instead was given two double beds. I know it seems petty to some| but since I had specifically requested this room and then was told they were ‚Äúfirst come first serve‚Äù I was unhappy. I don't think hotels should oversell their room types so people don't get what they reserved. To top it off| the front desk associate kept talking up the double room like it was their top tier room and it was just very fake.,0
Our stay at The Hilton Newark Airport was outstanding for my wife and I 15 year anniversary! Percy| who drives one of the vans there| is awesome and customer friendly!,1
the lobby is nice with a Bar and restaurant until midnight. They have Starbucks too. The room was ok. The toilet clogged twice but they came to fix it quickly.,1
Jamillah| who worked the front desk| was incredibly kind and helpful! She went above and beyond to make sure we had a good trip. Hotel was clean and well maintained. The shuttle staff was friendly too. We used the shuttle a lot. No complaints here!!!,1
Near a freeway but thick windows so silent.  Food overpriced.  Ordered a piza and glass of milk and cost $35 and not even very good.  No nearby stores or restaurants so you are stuck with hotel food.  The food items in little gift shop pantry not good either.  All junk food. Beds were good.  You can save $50 t0 $80 by staying at one of the other chains nearby but risk more noise and less comfortable bed so I paid up.  Airport shuttle from air train stop P4 does not come on a fixed schedule and only every 25 minutes or so so if you miss it can be kind of frustrating to wait in the cold. Shuttle to airport filled up so I had to wait for the next one so be careful about this.  They don't do reservations. Allow time or be front in line. But all in all I got what I wanted.,1
I liked the accommodations| the bedding and bed were extremely comfortable. The free shuttle service was also very convenient and very speedy! The bathroom on the other hand was very slow to drain and toilet also clogged up.,1
The airport shuttle from the airport only comes at their convenience| a group of 10 had to wait over 45 minutes to be picked up.  Do not stay at this hotel if you need to rely on the airport shuttle.,0
Stayed here on route to a family wedding. Buffet breakfast was nice. It wasn't a free breakfast| but wasquite good. Rooms are clean| spacious and quiet.Beds are very comfortable. The shuttle to the airport runs every 20 minutes.,1
The Cleaness and a Very helpful staff. The hotel shuttle bus clean and the driver well dress.,1
This property is nothing compared to the Hilton brand ...,0
I didn't like that there was no refrigerator in the room. Parking should be free for guests (valet $32 or Self parking garage $24),1
Conveniently close to the airport. Good shuttle to hotel.,1
Clean rooms. The hotel was very nice looking although I had no time to take a tour. The bus took long load us at airport... maybe because it was a holiday and was really crowded.Starbucks was only open until about 11:30 or 12 pm. Would of been nice longer hours but everything was good.,1
I didn't not appreciate the check in person who simply took a man who bullied his way straight to the desk ignoring people in line| but put us two women into the wait line which was not moving because he was being avoided| no one wanted to deal with him. So I waited my turn and told him| I didn't appreciate being discriminated against as women| him having checked in the bully without comment first. the rest was human neutrality on both our parts of the conversation. He appears to be a sadist and I would prefer a polite friendly person rather than a passive aggressive one. Thank you,1
Our flight was 12 hours late but they kept our reservations and were very polite at checkin at 4am. Service was exceptional.,1
Everything was clean and nice.. Staff was also nice,1
Room is very clear|nice service.checkin and check out fast. Thanks,1
Mostly good. Could have been cleaner as there were some small stains on the bed sheets etc. The room itself needed new decorations and appeared somewhat dated.,1
Facility needs upgrades| but room wasn't bad. Food and drink we're crazy expensive.,1
As I entered into the hotel| I was amazed at the design of the hotel! It was so classy and beautiful. However| upon entering into my room| I was disappointed by the two small double beds. I have stayed at many hotels|  so I have seen a normal size full| or queen double bed| that can accommodate two people. Lastly| when it was time for me to check out| the receptionist informed me that I had to pay $18.00 for parking! Oouch! Talk about being flabbergasted. The receptionist stated that the sign is located in front of the parking lot| but once again| I have stayed at many hotels| so parking is free if you stay overnight. But other than that| I enjoyed myself.,1
Close to airport without the noise of the planes flying overhead.,1
Communication with Expedia was very poor - no response to email enquiry,1
Easy access to airport| very friendly staff 2nd time here and no complaints,1
Nice location near airport. They have a free shuttle| but we had to ride 2 different air trains at Airport to get to pick up location. Room was nice but we found leftover food from previous guests in the fridge.,1
Staff answered any question that I happened to have.Bar had Dogfish Head 60-minute (one of my faves) on-tap = BONUSBreakfast was great (French Toast) furniture in there looking a bit worn..,1
Was not up to standard i was expecting.Staff were very friendly and Breakfast was extra| expensive and not up to the quality i usually get from a Hilton Hotel.,0
This hotel is close by the airport with shuttle service,1
Convenience of an in-house restaurant| especially as we arrived after an early flight out of NYC,1
Overnight stay returning from an international flight to flight on home. Clean room| excellent room service. Staff kind and pleasant,1
The staff was wonderful and pleasant from the very beginning. Loved there was a pool. Not enough parking.,1
It was great experience all around. Online downside would've been parking| however| everything else was great and as expected.,1
It was ok! Parking could have been better and less!,1
Great stay for a layover,1
The restaurant was useless| uninviting| service staff unfriendly and slow. Furniture in the bar area was outdated and so heavy one could not move a chair for more comfort.,1
The trip was great everything when as plan.,1
Very nice property| staff in general is very nice and kind (particularly Bell and Front Desk Staff). Very conveniently located near Newark airport. Shuttle service could be better| but in general the level of service received at the property is fantastic,1
How and where the restaurant was set up was unique and pleasant.,1
My stay was fabulous only thing the hotel needs is more food options,1
The ticket gates leaving the parking lot took 20 minutes to work. The first time leaving it wouldn't accept my card. Then upon check out it took my ticket but would not let me pay. It was Avery stressful experience exiting the parking lot.,1
The staff was poorly trained and not up to Hilton Standards.  My A/C went out and the motor was putting out a gas smell.  I called and called their guest line and no one would answer.  I literally had to go down to the front desk in my pajamas to get the problem taken care of.,0
Very conveniently located with quick access to Turnpike and Newark Penn Station.,1
Close to the airport. Shuttle service was a life saver.,1
Larry was the ONLY employee in that place that delivered outstanding customer service from the moment we arrived! We really appreciate Larry so much! We had so many issues with the other staff not wanting us to give us extra water bottles|blankets| and no one being at the restaurants to assist us. Terrible experience overall. Will never book this hotel again. Larry was the only great thing about this place.,0
The room was clean and the staff was extremely helpful and accommodating.,1
Thanks. Great location if going to the airport. Clean and friendly.,1
Free shuttle to the airport... Great customer services.,1
The staff was very nice and helpful. The hotel shuttle was very convenient to and from the airport. My only problem was that i didn't have a microwave in the room.,1
Staff is rude| technically Ghetto.... They treated me with disregard and very unprofessional. Was standing in front of check in and was ignored for 15 min before they asked me how they could help me. In the morning when I went to eat breakfast I was seated and then got up to serve myself breakfast to only find out that my table was given to someone else and had to wait for staff to fix another table for me. Overall worst Hilton Ive ever stayed in. I love Hilton Hotels I always stay in them anywhere I go but I would not recommend this one particular location.,0
Very clean. Polite staff. Quiet and comfortable room. The airport shuttle was very fast.,1
Clean| up to date| nice amenities| have to pay for parking which I didn't like| and room service is a little pricey but over all good hotel.,1
The property and staff were first rate. When we arrived the hotel had no record of our expedia reservation. It took a while to sort this out but we eventually got a room and our expedia reservation and payment were honored. Staff were very good to us during our wait.,1
IIt is a old run down hotel .  can see that they are dong omething but I should have known it was going through a constiction phase.,0
This was my second time staying here| as the previous stay was brilliant.   Service|cleanliness|etc was without a fault.  Both stays were for 1 night as we used it for a stop on our way to a cruise the next day .   My only complaint was the prices in the restaurant.  The food was fantastic| and interaction with the host|waitstaff and chef was excellent.   But felt hostage to the prices in the restaurant as there was no other food options around| being without a vehicle. Nothing Available in walking distance.,1
Good Hotel| close to airport,1
The hotel is Very convenient for flights out of EWR,1
This hotel is not worthy of the Hilton label. There appears to be some reconstruction underway| however| the property is so outdated it would take a complete gutting to change it to a name worthy of Hilton. Mattress of inferior quality to todays standards.,0
Staff was friendly and helpful.  Upgraded me but to a room that obviously had a smoker in it.,0
Close to airport but a depressing property - poor condition.,0
We always stay at the Hilton Newark Airport when we travel. Staff are always so friendly. Accommodations are comfortable and always clean.,1
Room Service was excellent and the Manager| Larry was very helpful. The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable. The wifi was very good too! While there was some construction in the lobby| the property was still in good shape. There are shuttles to the airport and a parking garage steps away from the hotel| You also have the option of Valet parking. You could not be closer to the airport. I would stay again!,1
Bar downstairs was the only bright spot.,0
the room was nice and I slept well. The restaurant food was ok|,1
The hotel was a last minute decision due to cancelled flight. The room is nice. The restaurant in lobby is great. Great food and service,1
Close to airport. Shuttle service efficient| running every 20 minutes.,1
Stayed here after our flight was canceled. Great hotel. Clean with updated rooms. Very comfortable and the bar area had great service.,1
Late night checkin. Easy and fast. Free waters with my Rewards #. Grand lobby. Not loud. Could not even hear the traffic| and no airplane noise at all. Professional staff.Great TV. Great internet. Great nights sleep.,1
On a positive note| the bed was comfortable| there is a Starbucks in the hotel and it appears to be well maintained (other than the housekeeping issues).,0
Dusty rooms. Check out a day earlier because of all the dust and awful smells like humidity in the room.,0
Everything was perfect Room so clean Stuff so friendly,1
I didn't like anything about the property. No courtesy or compassion from any of the staff.  I had to park my car far away from the hotel next to a graveyard because there was no parking available. The worst experience ever.,0
Good location| security need some training to threat guests with respect when informing| rooms dirty lots of dust.,1
Stayed overnight inbetween a connecting flight. Free shuttle was quick and extremely convenient. Beds were comfortable but very small and the restaurant downstairs is very overpriced for what you receive.,1
Proximity to Newark Airport| only 7 minutes drive away!!! Service staff are very patience with guest requests. Compliments to the hotel shuttle drivers!  The hotel shuttle that I tried to board was overcrowded but my luggages and my family are already on board. The driver made the initiative to call his backup shuttle immediately to pick the remaining guests| saving us from the blizzaring cold.,1
Everything was good. The pool was nice. Should stay open later,1
great room great breakfast shuttle from the airport made it easy to get to the hotel,1
I like that the property is close to the airport| I did not like the pillows on the bed and| the expensive parking that guest has to pay|,1
Perfect ambient clean rooms super comfort bed and friendly staff,1
Good staff. Rooms could use better lighting. ............................................,1
If you don't want to pay high Manhattan hotel prices| and don't mind taking a little time to get there from Jersey| this is a great place to stay!  The free hotel shuttle runs to and from the hotel every 20 minutes 24 hours a day to the airport where you can get the train to New York Penn station.  The hotel staff is very nice and helpful.  I thought the breakfast buffet was overpriced| but it was good and the wait staff was excellent.  The only downside to this hotel is that there is NOTHING around it as far as restaurants| drug stores| markets shopping| etc.  Those are accessible by Uber| Lyft| or cab| though.,1
Great hotel| on site parking and friendly staff... Highly recommend.,1
Great stay bar| food awesome| staff friendly professional,1
Love that they have everything on the premises Starbucks| restaurants airport parking,1
The staff went above and beyond too accommodate my family for our stay. My newlywed cousins were so happy with the service and attention to details.,1
Loved it. Big clean roon. With everything you need.,1
Comfortable and convenient. One mile away from Newark Airport. Shuttle to and from the airport every twenty minutes.,1
It was average experience. Nothing special about it.,1
The property was clean the grand entrance was really nice your staff is friendly will manage. The only thing was the bathroom of room 715 you cannot open the bathroom door fully if the toilet led was down I found that strange.,1
Rooms probably need some updating but overall rooms are comfortable.,1
I cannot believe they do not have a microwave in their rooms. Also the fridge is always off so you have to turn it in before using it.,0
Convenient to airport| quick check in and out| friendly efficient staff,1
The property is clean and in good condition| and it is a good location for those flying into or out of Newark International Airport.  The staff was friendly and professional as well.,1
It was a nice hotel.   Clean and friendly staff.We missed the shuttle by 2 minute and had to wait 28 minutes for the next shuttle and it was pretty full we had to push our way to get on it.   Wished shuttle had a sign up list so those who are early get on without having to fight for a ride.    There is nothing around here to eat at and hotel food was very expensive.   Had to order out.,1
Wasn't asked about Hilton Honours or room preference. Was given room with 2 small beds instead of one larger bed.,0
The front desk staff was very professional and nice| even the housekeeping staff was very nice too.,1
Convenient location for getting in and out of NYC. Quiet and clean.,1
We stayed here for a night after our vacation and before our flight home. It was exactly what we needed. Clean| comfortable and roomy.,1
Room was dusty... No Bueno for an allergy sufferer..,1
Room was good with a comfortable bed and quiet. Hotel is fairly isolated with not much within walking distance| so you are pretty much confined there for meals. Dinner was good| but expensive. Breakfast should be part of the room price|but wasn't for us. $22 per person is too much for a typical 'free' hotel breakfast. Because of this| I would stay elsewhere the next time.,1
Service was good. Hotel was a bit old and dated. There is free shuttle to airport.,1
Curtain was one large blackout curtains so no middle line of sunlight. They allowed a late check-out.The staff were patient and courteous and the airport shuttle was prompt with beyond helpful drivers. Very happy withy stay.,1
All staff was friendly and helpful.  The room was nice and clean.  Kids loved the pool!  Food was expensive so we didn't eat on the restaurant.,1
No bellman for 10 pm check in| otherwise very nice.,1
Loved the room really nice and comfortable.  Staff was great! Loved the indoor pool,1
Great stay. Comfy clean hotel at a good price,1
Very nice hotel close to Newark airport. Rooms very nice. Looks recently remodeled. Very convenient shuttle to a/p.,1
Good would certainly stay there again.  The staff were very obliging| courteous and fun,1
Rooms| staff and restaurant Were great - friendly and clean,1
Nice place for me going on a Tour with a log of people from otter countries,1
Good location and convenient for airport commute|we always stay in this hotel when we travel to/ from Newark|shuttle bus is puncture,1
We (family of 4) stayed there after a NYC visit for an early flight the next morning. A late dinner in the hotel restaurant| the free airport shuttle in the morning and everything else was great. Would definitely do this again.,1
It's an Hilton. Everything good as usual. Good customer service,1
very conveniently located right above a subway station| just across the street from a park| a great restaurant (Pepolino)| and all of Soho: can't beat that.,1
I had a great stay. I would highly recommend.,1
nice place to stay,1
Great location. Clean rooms and friendly service.,1
HGI in Tribeca was one of the most disappointing properties I have stayed at| I have stayed at several. The staff were unfriendly| the location on the border of nice parts of SoHo and a trashy street. The TV was old and remote barely worked| the lock on the door was broken| I could even close the door half the time with out messing with the lock on the inside for several minutes. I got placed next to a noisy supply closet where workers opened| moved things around| and slammed the door. The toilet had issues flushing| the nob on the shower to control heat was also on the fritz.  I love Hilton| but not this property.,0
It's a great hotel to stay at in SoHo!,1
Staff was very helpful for directions and recommendations,1
The location is the best. Even a subway station is there,1
Desk staff was awesome!  Really went the extra mile (early check-in; late check-out).  Still recovering from Covid| so no daily room cleaning| etc.  Had to ask for linens; no coffee in the morning| but they were just coming back into normal when we left.  Great bunch of people.,1
Front desk staff was rude| shower was cold| toilet was semi functional| running for 10 mins with each flush,0
Absolutely great location for the area.  Room was updated and very comfortable.,1
Great location| good for families.,1
The stay was mostly fine and the guest services staff were pleasant| but there wasn't anything spectacular about the stay. The decor is outdated so it was tough to tell if surfaces and areas like the carpet were clean or just old.,1
Clean| comfortable room. Convenient location and friendly staff but neighborhood has deteriorated (trash| graffiti) due to DeBlasio and City Council lack of care and maintenance.,1
Rooms were clean| staff was friendly| and the location was very convenient. You can't ask for much more than that.,1
Who ever stayed in the room before us their shoes were under the bed. The toilet took a few times to flush,1
The staff at this hotel was one of the worst to date! My boyfriend stayed here for a work trip and called me immediately after checking in to fill me in in the attitude of the front desk lady. She was rude| not welcoming and aggressive. He had questions for her about his reservations and she was less than interested to answer anything. Would've much rather stay somewhere where you actually feel WELCOMED at the hotel.,0
It was a very nice hotel| very clean. It was super quiet which made for a good little get away,1
Convenient to the areaWe were visiting by walking,1
The room was big and spacious. No modern walk in shower| but it wasn't bad| tub and shower head. Due to the pandemic| the rooms haven't been used in months so you gotta wait 20 minutes for the hot water to rise. After that it was pretty smooth. They have nice mirrors. Great staff. Wonderful time.,1
Great location| secure| and free parking in surrounding streets starting at 6 p.m. on Friday nights (for the weekend).,1
Property was neat and clean. Great location as well. I would def recommend/stay there again.,1
Very clean and friendly staff. Spacious room. Thank you!,1
Most things were fine. I do wish the staff would wear masks at all times when in the common spaces of the building though. Covid is airborne| so putting on your masks only when a client walks in doesn't help nearly as much as wearing them all the time would. The maid on 5 didn't seem to have a mask at all,1
This hotel is amazing. It is so clean and sanitized. They took extreme measures to make sure their guests stayed covid free. Our room was literally sealed shut with a sticker that said it was sanitized. The front desk was helpful and quick. Will definitely stay here again,1
Great hotel with a great location!Very Clean!,1
Nice place to stay,1
Great location| near to the subway and many options for eating out but don't take it for breakfast available because you'll have a surprise when they say that They haven't offered since the pandemic began and the other negative was the mattress| very uncomfortable,0
Room was clean and comfortable| with fast WiFi. Ok,1
Very clean| very friendly| very accommodating| will be staying here again,1
Alena at the front desk was beyond great! The rooms are super duper clean. The area has lots of restaurants and the subway is right outside. I would definitely recommend this hotel.,1
Your website I suppose is not up to date with the Hilton  garden inn I had my aunt book me a reservation got off my long flight to be told I could not put down a security deposit in cash (50$) nor would they let me call in the numbers over the phone from the same card the room was payed for a reserved under so I am out 100 dollars and no hotel.,0
Great location| super friendly staff. Clean and spacious room(for New York.) My only complaint| is the fire alarm went off twice at 3:30am..so much for a good night's sleep. We did not have to vacate our room| but it was disruptive none the less.,1
Very clean hotel especially with this COVID 19.   I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice location with great service.,1
Very clean great staff pleasant welcomingQuiet rooms are big ....,1
Not too sold on the location but its very close to transportation. Other than that| I was VERY pleased.,1
This is a very nice hotel. Quiet (the doors are solid and seem to seal out ambient noise well).,1
I loved everything about it and thy also don't mind helping I love it,1
Nice place and very comfortable| near train station and different place to buy. A few minutes from wall st and Freedom Tower,1
Location and staff (friendly)Heating in room hard to control.,1
This was very accessible for a girls weekend to visit NYC| Tribeca| Battery Park| 9/11 Museum and memorial. Everything we wanted was walkable within 10-15 mins| easy cab right home in evening. Fabulous Italian restaurant directly across the street - highly recommend! The bar onsite was busy and fun| open for breakfast in the morning. Overall great stay.,1
Located in TriBeCa| with a subway station almost at the entrance. 15 mn walk from World Trade Center. Rooms are spacious but slightly older. Staff is very helpful.,1
We had a really nice view from our room| the staff is very friendly and helpful. Everyone was very kind about my service dog.,1
"The staff were absolutely wonderful and went above and beyond.  Super friendly.  I asked for a quiet room and they found one (you can have a view| or it can be quiet--again| for New York| not like you're in the country). The room was large for New York| water pressure good.  Bed was ok.Downsides: someone mentioned deferred maintenance -- that's also true though nothing was an actual problem.  The walls are that institutional beige that NYC hotels love to use and paper thin| so you will hear what's happening in the hallway.  Oh| and they throttle the ""free"" internet to try and get you to pay.  All of these complaints are very minor| but you might want to know about them.Go in with reasonable expectations and you'll have a nice stay.  I certainly did!",1
We stayed overnight for a pizza class and movie.  Staff was amazing- had room ready early and car valet was so friendly.  Hotel looked great.,1
very convenient location| close to Hudson river & subway| just below soho and above downtown. On checkin| ask for room with street view,1
It was a very nice hotel.  Good bar and grill| however disappointed that it closes so early on a Saturday night.  Otherwise everything else was great.,1
Our recent stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca was great!  The staff were all welcoming and very helpful.  The room was small which is typical for NYC but with good amenities. Would stay here again.,1
The room was clean which is most important to me. But the hotel was overbooked for rooms with king beds and I was given a room with two double beds| and not refunded the extra $7 I paid to reserve the king room (obviously not a huge deal but would've been nice). Overall was acceptable. I much prefer the Hilton Garden in Financial district| though.Also a random note.... The mattresses were pillow top but both were flipped so that the soft side was facing the floor..... sorta weird. Comfortable nonetheless.,1
Location| street view| didn't get the room expected| compensated with complimentary breakfast,1
Property is an excellent location. Easy access to trains| food| and perfect walking distance to china town or little italy. Staff was super friendly. Far enough away from the crazy commotion of NYC but trains are so easily accessed traversing the city is easy.,1
"Our rating is 5 stars plus! From the moment we arrived until we left| the front desk staff was most helpful and courteous...and were more than happy to give us directions to anywhere. The room itself was nice and clean. ""Pros"" - (too many to mention). ""Con"" - the tv (which we really didn't have much time to watch): the remote was worn out and needs replaced. Also| maybe it was only the tv in our room| but the only local channels we could watch were 2 and 13. Channels 4| 7| 9| and 11| were ""No Signal"".   The restaurant (AOA Bar and Grill) was a bit pricey (probably normal NYC prices). We ate there twice for dinner and certainly did not leave hungry. They do feed you. However| we think their breakfast prices are too high| so we suggest you walk to Tribeca Bagels which is about a block away on the south side of Canal Street. It is a small place but is our favorite NYC restaurant.    Would we stay at Hilton Garden Inn again? YES!",1
We stayed at this hotel after seeing a show in Newark| so we arrived around 11pm. The ladies at the front desk were absolutely exceptional. The room was perfect size for our family of 4| which is not always the norm for NYC hotels. The attached restaurant had a nice buffet breakfast. Everyone we encountered was very friendly. We were very comfortable and will be back.,1
Good location. Easy to get to SoHo shops. Staff was friendly and helpful in giving information and directions.,1
It was a nice stay with my family for a few nights.  They provided a pack n play as their infant bed (crib) which worked out great.  There was a subway station in the front of the hotel| a Starbucks across the street as well as a food cart with coffee/donut,1
It was definitely a nice hotel for the price and I liked the location.,1
Great location! Room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The room was a bit small. The bathroom lighting is awful and the hair dryer was broken but even if it worked it was awful. They responded quickly and provided a replacement . They text to check in on how things are going| which is nice. Staff was very friendly and professional. The free coffee was awful!! ( decaf). I would stay again in spite of the things that weren't wonderful.,1
Great business hotel. Location accessible to most of lower Manhattan by cab| easy to get. Room very comfortable| quiet| and dark. Would stay here again.,1
As a former New Yorker| I had a great time staying in this hotel. Amazing location and easy to commute by Sab or walking! overall great experience. Would go back there.,1
Fantastic hotel! Clean| well-maintained| super friendly and helpful staff| comfortable| and in a safe area. Highly recommend for either business or personal trips.,1
The receptionists were amazing and hotel was clean.,1
This hotel was great. Centrally located| close to the subway and walking distance to many attractions. Staff was lovely and helpful. Room size was good for NY and things were comfortable. Would stay again in a heartbeat.,1
Great location| efficient and welcoming staff| easy check-in| complete basic amenities| NO ‚ÄúRESORT FEE‚Äù,1
The property was so convenient to the subway and the cab service was easily available.  We were close to great dining and in walking distance to shopping and restaurants.,1
We stayed 1 night. Bar & Grill connected to hotel was nice. We are from PA so to exit the city and go home was awesome!,1
Offered me a quiet room| and it was a game-changer. Great location| clean| modern. Staff wasn't the friendliest| but that's fine.,1
room alarm kept on going off| first night went off again at 3 am and they took it away but couldn't get back to sleep,1
Staff and place its really nice and will go back again,1
the room is a little compact BUT had all amenities and I slept great! ITS REALLY CLOSE to shopping,1
Nice| close to subway lines| walking distance to many attractions.,1
Staff waa professional and accomodating. Did not liake the gact that there is no parking and valet parking is $75.00 per day.,1
This hotel is perfect if you're driving into NYC. Just a qtr mi past Holland Tunnel and offering Valet Parking. The room and service were excellent. I will definitely stay here again.,1
Convenient location| easy access to subway and Chinatown| overall a good stay,1
First room I received stunk of cigarettes,0
Is very clean I love it| nice personal they attended me very respectfully,1
The stay was amazing. Only issue was the AC but the staff was great took care of the issue and made it up to us. Great walking distance to alot of attraction. Subway is right infront of the hotel. Just amazing.,1
The location is very convenient for the subway.  The mattress and bedding were all very comfortable.,1
Hotel is in a great location and easy to walk to many restaurants| tourist sights| the river| etc.  It's not fancy but it's clean and comfortable and the staff are super friendly.,1
Great location and value for this property.  Would stay again,1
We arrived at 2:30pm and the receptionist Karelin Bruno charged my credit card for 50$ without any explanation| and asked us to wait in the lobby because ‚Äòthere won't be room ready until 3pm'. Shortly after we sit| many other people came and checked in before 3pm. I approached her again at 3pm| and she asked the last name and ID again for check in. I was very uncomfortable with her attitude.,0
My experience was good except that the room wasn't cleaned when I returned at 2:20 pm on two separate days.  The maid service was prompt once I asked.  I was told that they have until 6 pm to clean the rooms.  In fact| one maid opened the door on me during my visit to clean my room.  She apologized.  She didn't know that another maid cleaned the room for me at about 3 pm| but it wasn't a thorough cleaning.  She didn't wipe down the night tables| desk| and dressers or replace the napkins and stirrer packets.  It would be convenient to have a door sign that says the housekeeping service is requested. However| the front desk workers were friendly and helpful. I would definitely come back.,1
All went real well. I'd come back again. The bellman was awesome in providing ideas in and around Tribeca,1
Clean and quiet...away from the city crowd.Beds were too soft though and it was difficult getting in and out of the shower because of the height of the jacuzzi. Did not see much of the hotel other than the room but the staff was incredibly friendly!,1
Great hotel in Tribeca!  Had a great stay there!,1
Great location| close to downtown| soho and China town area.,1
Good location between Tribeca & Soho but room was disappointing with dated d√©cor| would suggest trying the vast selection a short walk away downtown.,0
Great,1
Everything was good but the girl at from desk was really nasty beyond professional! Her name was Krystal alleyneBecause of her I will never stay at that hotel again not recommend it.,0
Great location for our second trip to NYC.  Love the less hustle and bustle!  Would definitely stay here again!,1
We stayed two nights| extending our New York visit to over a week. The location was perfect| the staff was very friendly. The room was very comfortable and clean| with a nice view.,1
This is a very nice reasonably priced hotel in the Tribeca area with a subway entrance right next to it for easy city transport. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and plan to return.,1
Great restaurant. Very nice staff. Crazy expensive parking though. That's the only thing that would make me think twice about a return stay.,1
Great location and great service!! Staffs are very friendly.,1
The staff is very friendly and helpful. The hotel is very clean.,1
I go often it is always good and orgsnized. They are always cordial and efficient,1
Can't beat price and location| no frills but clean and we'll maintained with friendly staff. Perfect home base for NYC.,1
I had a basically good stay.  It was quiet in my room| there were two beds as requested| and the cleaning staff was helpful.  When I returned home| however| all my clothes had to be washed (as did I) and both my husband and I had coughing| sneezing| and congestion.  I think| as a dog friendly hotel| that pillows| blankets| and carpeting are not as clean as they should be in that situation.  I don't know hotel policy on this| but even pillows and blankets must be washed after a dog stays in a room.  Good vacuuming and filters are also essential.  Many people have allergies and a clean room is essential. Better room lighting would also be nice.,1
Very close to 2 main subway lines. Hotel was very clean| restaurant connected was good. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Only thing is in the lobby| they always seems to run out of coffee.,1
Needed peace and quite in a good hotel. Love Tribeca and surrounding area so this was perfect. Great overnight stay.,1
Good location close to shopping and restaurants Restraunt in hotel,1
Hotel staff was very helpful with directions as well as making recommendations for dinner. Location was convenient for where we needed to get| easy to access subway too. Hotel was clean and room was comfortable (especially for the price!),1
Expensive parking $85 bucks for 1 night,1
Location is good for my stay in New York. !!!!!!!!!!!!,0
Everything about the hotel's location| service| cleanliness| etc.| would definitely bring me back. My only issues were the one-size-fits-all breakfast buffet and the very poor wi-fi connection.,1
The staff was very friendly and the location was great. Loved the room.,1
Great location. Friendly staff. Early check in was not a problem at all. Rooms are large (by NY standards) and clean.,1
Good location with available street parking over the weekend.  Very close to the subway.  Room was nice but bedding had dirt on in when we arrived - like pet hair maybe   Bedding also did not stay on the bed.  Both nights I woke up cold and found the blankets on the floor - several times.  Very odd.,1
Very well located with a lot of places to eat around the area. Walking distance to Ground Cero. Hotel very clean and pleasant.,1
Great location!! Hotel staff very kind!! Stayed for 5 nights and no complains,1
Great experience! Front desk service was top notch. Would definitely stay here again.,1
Wonderful location. It's right on the subway line and surrounded by great restaurants but far enough away from the busy Times Square. Rooms are slightly outdated and there were a few stains on the carpet in the room but we didn't stay in the room much so it was ok. One of our bed sheet smelled bad and we had it changed without any issues. Staff are very friendly and greeted us everyone we walked in or out. Would definitely stay here again!,1
Everything was excellent except that we couldn't close the curtains to block the bright streetlights shining into the room every night.,1
Great location.  Rooms were adequately sized.  Breakfast was convenient and nicely done.,1
When we went to check in with a reservation| we were told they didnt have our king size bed with a city view room reservation that we paid extra for. when my husband said we want money back| all of a sudden they had not one room but 2. imagine that. WHY?,0
I liked the location because it was close to the places I wanted to visit.,1
Clean modern and good location for little italy and china town ...my 2nd time there !,1
Great hotel| I would definitely stay here again. Great location| friendly and helpful staff.,1
Friendly staff.  Nice restaurant/bar particularly for watching sports.  Rooms were small but clean.,1
Cleanest Hotel| can measure up against any more expensive hotels in the area.,1
location - away from the city center but right next to the subway.  Good spacious room| comfortable bed| clean.,1
Perfect location for our event and nice room!,1
The room was on fifth floor with natural light & distance from street noise.  The in-room Air Conditioning was loud even on lowest setting.  We needed to turn off to get to sleep.   I mentioned it to the front desk the first evening but unaware if anything was done (mentioned at check out also).  Near subway & Tribeca/downtown neighborhoods.,1
Nice room| had construction going on early Saturday morning outside the window,1
It was very comfortable experience| the area is a fun and walkable to many places.,1
Nice hotel centrally located in TriBeCa. Close to the Brooklyn bridge| parks| music venues. Nice restaurant next door for dinner with outdoor dining. Also for breakfast| nice breakfast buffet. The subway station is literally across the street from the hotel,1
We had been traveling for over a week and stayed in other hotels along the way. After the last one| our room in Tribeca was amazingly clean| comfy and inviting!,1
Cost of valet parking was more than advertised.,1
Walking distance to Chinatown and Italian down. Very convenient.,1
The people that work at this hotel are terrific.,1
Close to Subway and easy access to everything in that part of NYC.,1
This place was fantastic. Clean and the staff was incredible. Worth every penny. We moved to a different hotel during our stay and are paying more and get so much less. We will be back!,1
Great service. Breakfast was awesome - well prepared with great service and was a great value. The A C & E trains were actually at the door. A very cool neighborhood in tribeca with many excellent and varied style and priced  reataurants less than a 5 minute walk away. A train stop or 2 or 30 minute walk away from both Chelsea and Wall Street/911 memorial.,1
Great location and nice facility. But| the safe was locked when we got there which was an inconvenience.,1
Our stay was nice. The room was clean and orderly. We have no complaints and love staying at hilton hotels.,1
the room smelled bad,0
Great area if you like the downtown area. Staff is very nice and informative. Beds are very comfortable!!!,1
Great location| friendly and helpful staff| clean and comfortable room. Very happy with my stay.,1
Otherwise| the hotel was nice| clean and a pleasant stay for New York City.,1
Very friendly staff| clean| roomy and perfect location for our girls weekend.,1
Plenty of free on-street parking. Will definitely stay again.,1
Great location for this trip as we needed to spend time in lower Manhattan and the Times Square area. Subway lines were very convenient.,1
Liked everything about the hotel and the. location. Only complaint would be the 75 dollar parking fee per night with no options.,1
Very convenient location! Used E train at Canal Street station to go most places and walked to the rest.,1
Perfect location!  Literally right next to a major subway stop (A train).  It is a clean and quiet hotel but the heating was a bit odd...it was either super hot or super chilly| especially the bathroom in the morning.  The bed comfort was ok.  I would stay here again simply for the location and convenience of it.,1
Sorry Hilton| this is a no go.,0
The accommodations were good but could have been better.  The service was excellent,1
Super easy to get the subway,1
I came for business and stayed two days. The room and amenities were excellent. The cost is reasonable| the staff exceptional. The beds were comfortable| the room clean and warm in these winter months. I enjoyed the in room coffee maker and the microwave and fridge. One of the best elements aside from the bed and the wonderful view was the bath tub which was ample and the water hot hot hot. I will come back again and highly recommend.,1
Great service. Convenient location. Wonderful staff. No hassle sign in.,1
The staff was great. The place was sooo clean. My only negative is that my bed was warped. But overall great experience!!!,1
We had a nice stay at the Hilton Garden.  The room was larger than I expected for Manhattan.  The hotel bar is great (good food| strong beer list).  The bed in our room may have been the worst mattress I ever slept on| the toilet ran constantly| and basic re-stockings (coffee| towels| shampoo) were frequently overlooked by housekeeping.  But the room and facilities were clean| check in was easy| the the area is safe.,1
For a weekend going around NYC you can't beat the location. The subway is 20 steps from the front door and World Trade Center area is a 10 minute walk,1
It's an easy NYC stay in downtown. Right by the subway. Decent sized rooms and restaurant on site.,1
My daughter and I couldn't be more pleased with our stay at Hilton Gardens Inn Tribeca! Marcus at the front desk was an amazing resource about local| high quality restaurants and attractions.  His genuine warmth and attention to detail made our stay delightful!  Housekeeping was very understanding when we took a little extra time to collect all of our new purchases and check out.  I highly recommend HGI Tribeca for everyone - young| old or in between!,1
Hotel is right at a subway line A|C|E tracks which was good as very cold outside. Room with 2 twins for 4 people and luggage is a little tight and cramped. Bathroom is small too also. But its New York and real estate is at a premium.,1
Great room sizes| especially for NY City. The staff was friendly overall| but nothing spectacular. However| for NYC| they were really friendly.,1
Our stay was perfect from beginning to end the room was very nice and the staff beyond wonderful.  We will definitely be staying again .,1
Worst customer service I've ever seen. They steal.,0
Overall| rating a 4 as the attached AoA Grill was less than average service.  Especially| compared to the desk staff.,1
The two gentlemen who work the night shift Saturday were rude as to the point they never acknowledge me one time. Other then that I had a great stay.,1
The hotel was really nice and really clean. My only compliant was that they had recently stained the wood in the elevator and they didn't have a sign displayed and therefore I ended up with stain all over my hands.,1
Great location!  Easy to get to other points of interest. Also Feds comfortable.,1
coffee maker| fridge and micro,1
Subway is right in front of the hotel (Canal St. Station). Restaurants and shopping are within walking distance. Our room was clean and good size for NYC.,1
The hotel staff did a wonderful job ensuring that we had a room on an upper level floor (to minimize road noise| mainly honking cars) and that we could check in a little earlier than regular times so we could drop our items off in our room and get ready for a wedding. We did use their valet parking and they had our car ready for us when we requested it. I very much appreciated the Keurig coffee maker in the room!,1
We were on a low floor just over the street and could watch the nightlife and still see the stars. There were sheer curtains that gave us privacy while still allowing us to see the city. There was no noise| because we had the a/c on. We had a great time| this was a perfect spot to start the day - subway right outside the door. Beds were comfortable and plush with nice bedspreads.,1
It was a very clean and pleasant hotel. The staff could not be more friendly and courteous and helpful. Would stay there again,1
Located at Tribeca| Easy to go the NYC attractions| very clean room and kind staffs although the facility is little bit old.,1
We were happy with our stay here.  I would definitely consider staying in Tribeca again given ease of access to downtown| the Village| the Lower East Side and mid-town.  If you are willing to walk 5-10 blocks you don't even have to take cabs to get to some great restaurants.  Avoid the crowds of Times Square and other more obvious places to stay.,1
Very clean and cozy. I have stayed in several hotels in NYC and this hotel is certainly one of the best price to quality ratio.,1
Fantastic hotel with large rooms for New York located next to a subway station only criticism is the roadworks going on when I stayed for a week,1
Housekeeping and front desk staff were awesome.  Esperenza and Mark,1
Enjoyed my trip. Stayed with my dad. The rooms were spacious | clean and affordable. Hotel is close to Canal St subway. Leave you car at home! Took the train to see the 4th of July fireworks. No travel stress. Near Wall St.,1
Would definitely stay there again.,1
Clean comfortable and close to my event parking was surprisingly reasonable for NYC,1
This was an ideal base for a great holiday. Hotel rooms were big with all amenities. Good breakfasts available plus free coffee on the go. Location was excellent| easy walking distance to Hudson River| Little Italy| World Trade Centre and a huge choice of restaurants. Highly recommended.,1
Wonderful hotel  in Tribeca.  The staff were welcoming and helpful|  and allowed us to check in at 2 PM after a long morning of travel.  The rooms were clean and quiet|  and spacious by New York standards.  I would definitely stay here again and and highly recommend this hotel.,1
Great place to stay.  Friendly| helpful staff| clean room| and close to the subway.  Would stay there again.,1
Go to other Hilton Garden Inn in Manhattan if you can!,0
Wonderful!  Great stay in NYC.  Quiet.  Clean. Comfortable. Excellent staff.,1
We only stayed one night| but it was great. The location was perfect| the hotel bar was really fun and the service at the front desk was great. The room was very small| but it is NY.  Would definitely stay again.,1
Good location|  comfortable room. Staff was very helpful.,1
Messed up my room but nice quiet and clean hotel,1
Great location for restaurants| things to do and best of all| the subway. Staff was friendly and the room was comfortable and clean. Awesome value for NYC!,1
Most comfortable bed and sheets I've experienced in a while in a medium priced room.,1
Everything was great except on Satruday night |the guests next door were having  a very loud altercation. They finally settled down after 11:30. We were just about to alert the front desk| but it calmed down.,1
Great hotel for the price. Terrific location,1
Great staff Joe and German friendly and full of recommendations for local places to eat and visit. Our tv didn't work | we reported it fixed promptly| only needed it to keep track of March Madness| coffe in lobby GREAT| should he kept out longer|,1
Beautiful room and such a nice space. Initially| I was concerned as the room is right next to the elevator but we did not hear a thing. The Hilton is our go to hotel when we stay in the SoHo area. The only thing I don't like about this hotel is the hair dryer. It is attached to the wall. The location is fantastic being close to the Subway exit and all of the shops and restaurants in SoHo.,1
Nice hotel in a great location.,1
Edwin was a fantastic concierge,1
Very CLEAN! If your looking for a place to stay nothing fancy this is your place,1
The bed I slept on was not that great| I sank into a big hole.,1
The location is very central to very many attractions. The staff went above and beyond to accommodate our experience. The gave us an early check-in and put out hot chocolate instead of coffee for our little ones. They were very personal and remembered our names. If you have noisy neighbors you will be able to hear them but that only happened one of the 4 nights we were there and we were so tired from all the things we got to do that day we fell right asleep. For the price| excellent experience.,1
"Great location with subway station right outside the door. Staff was very friendly and helpful| especially the concierge. Although once we tried to get room service and they never answered the phone (but I think that was actually the restaurant downstairs). Room was comfortable but it could have used a new shower head| or better pressure. The ""pantry"" downstairs had basic snacks but not as extensive as some I've seen| and no beer or wine (but bar/restaurant in the building). Overall happy with our stay| a great affordable option.",1
Would definitely stay again.,1
This was a nice hotel| and pleasant experience.  The only negative was our room was noisy.  The heat/air unit was loud| and we heard the conversation of any person walking in the hall.,1
it was really bad| we pay for a suite| but they just put 2 beds in a room and charge much more.,0
Overall good. We have stayed here before| so this was a deliberate choice and based on room size. All staff were friendly and obliging. Some details need attention. Over the holiday period the house keeping staff appeared really pushed. Restocking the beverages seemed a fairly random process| but this is nothing in the scale of things. More important was that the rest rooms in the reception area shared with the AOA restaurant were in a poor condition - not a good impression to create.,1
Great location| right above a subway that brought you into and out of uptown and all the major areas. 10/10 will stay here again when we come back| can't recommend it enough.,1
Cons: They seem do not provide free toothbrush and toothpaste for travelers who forgot to bring their own. No free bottle water in room.,1
The hotel was nice and location was great for our stay. The subway entrance was right outside the hotel which was great. Staff at front desk were wonderful and very helpful. One problem we did have was that our room was not restocked daily with coffee or these items. Overall I would recommend this hotel for a stay.,1
Clean rooms great service,1
Great time seeing the sites of NYC. Great restraunts walking distance. Chelsea market great.,1
I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this hotel.  The front desk workers were friendly and genuinely concerned.  I loved my spacious and clean room.  The bed was very comfortable.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.  I loved how close it was to Soho| Chinatown| and Little Italy.  Highly recommended!,1
The location was great-our daughter lives nearby. Canal St. station 1-2-3 very close by.. Staff was awesome.  Not luxury| but very clean and convenient.  We will stay again!,1
We thought the hotel was just okay. But the staff was really nice and very accommodating. When we announced that it was our anniversary| they comped us a bottle of wine.,1
Cool area. Friendly front desk staff and a big help with parking.  Enjoyable stay,1
Very nice place to stay in Lower Manhattan. Easy access to restaurants| shops and sights. Walking distance to park on Hudson River.,1
Good location| clean and friendly staff. Stay there often and have always enjoyed the experience.,1
Good location in The lower west side. Would stay there again.,1
Check in was quick| and the receptionist even went out of her way to help us with finding street parking| which we did!  Location is right inside the Holland tunnel| and walking distance to a ton of great restaurants and shopping within SoHo.  Hotel is also right next to the subway as well.  Will definitely be staying here again.,1
Great location.  Super-friendly and helpful front desk.,1
Hotel amenities are limited but adequate. This is not a location to stay in anyway. Highly recommended.,1
We loved the hotel. We stayed for 3 nights.  The only thing we didn't like was how firm the beds were but everything else was great.,1
Everything was great about our stay except the pillows were terrible. They were extremely flat and I have a sensitive neck. I had a terrible sleep and haven't been able to move my neck in 2 days. I even requested better pillows but they were just as flat.,1
Only stayed on night with our teenage grand-daughters.  Plenty of room for four in the room.,1
Joe| Vinny| Edwin.....what a team. They truly give your company 110 percent.,1
This Hotel is not necessarily in the middle of everything but it is so easy to get a cab or take the subway. It was comfortable and staff was so kind. As a young woman traveling alone| I felt safe at all times. I suggest this hotel for any woman or solo travelers.,1
Convenient location| good prices and reasonably sized rooms for Manhattan make this a very good choice in terms of cost/benefit.However| our stay was marred by very poor housekeeping (among other things| we had to ask twice| on two separate occasions| to have the room's trash bins emptied - were it not for Mr. Julius| on the night staff| who immediately took matters into his own hands| we'd still be waiting...)A formal complaint to the front desk about this| and the general sub-par cleaning| went nowhere.,1
Great service and very comfortable beds. Rooms and interior a bit outdated.,1
No thrills| older building| good location| on the subway station. Rooms are fine. Very friendly staff. Would recommend it!,1
Unluckily| the construction was going on during my stay| so a little bit noisy. The staff are almost ok. Very convenient for traffic. The roomkey didn't work once and had to come down to front desk to make it work again.( That happened when I stayed here before| so this was second time.),1
Location is excellent and many of the best restaurants in the neighborhood.  Also good location for shops at Broadway.  Rooms were fine| some of them rather small but with all facilities needed.  The service of the staff was very good and they were helpful.  The restaurant| the bar and breakfast was good.  Would suggest this hotel to friends| both for location and standard of the hotel.,1
It's a terrible hotel| they cancel my reservation and didn't contact me. The manager was rude and mean| and you can imagine how the staff will be. 0 customer service. Don't go their guys.,0
We found everything to be quite nice| clean| and peaceful.The staff there were very professional and took the time to listened  to my questions.  I felt very much at home there.,1
The shuttle service was great,1
This property is not as advertised. There is no free parking| required $25   a day valet. The pool is closed and has been for over a year. I paid for a room and breakfast every morning and they did not see that at the desk and I spent half a day on the phone with orbitz trying to get that fixed. When I did| the lady at the front desk still gave me attitude about it| except Crystal- she is wonderful! The room was less than clean and someone had set our room alarm to 4:20am and we have two exhausted children (I'm all for a 4:20 joke but COME ON). There was a ‚ÄúJesus fish‚Äù painted in wax or crayon on our bathroom mirror that was super creepy| sheets had a stain| curtains stained and found old Cheerios and pills around the beds. ALSO even though I paid in full for our stay I was required to put a $400 deposit on my room ($100 a night) which I was not aware of before check in. Do yourself a favor and stay at the Marriott next door!,0
Everything was good except they did not answer the phone for the shuttle.,1
They advertise a pool as an amenity and when we arrived| the staff said the pool is closed indefinitely.  They advertise free parking| and when we arrived| they are charging $25 a day plus tax. We had to park on the street. This was not a pleasant stay and we will never ever stay at this property again.,0
Clean room| fair price| courteous staff| and appreciated the frequent airport shuttle service.,1
Hotel was as expected. Excellent airport shuttle service.  Room was fine| but perfume smell and ac was noisy.,1
Run down rooms and hallways,1
It was clean and the staff were great,1
It's Convenience if you only staying for one night and traveling,0
The staff here is super friendly and helpful! Check in and out is quick! This property is very quiet and you can get lots of rest and relaxation here!,1
The hotel it's a little old,1
This property is very convenient due to its proximity to JKF airport.,1
We understand that due to the pandemic and though the food personnel was great| clean and friendly| there were very few choices on the menu.,1
Stay was short due to a flight but it was comfortable. Only negative was the AC unit was noisy but otherwise a pleasant stay.,1
The housekeeping staff was extremely nice,1
We were told that he shuttle to the airport is 30 minutes and arrived 5:20am for 5:30pm bus| waited until 5:40 for a shuttle to come but was told it's for the airline crew| the second one arrived shortly afterwards but it was an unpleasant experience to have to wait almost 20 minutes in the early morning with young kids.And the air conditioner in our room is very very LOUD!,1
Super old and dirty,0
Perfect,1
Friendly staff. Excellent food in bar. Quiet and clean.,1
Every day did not cleaning my room.,1
It was very clean it should been more towels,1
Very Nice Clean close to highway easy access,1
The staff made my stay all the more better,1
The most disappointing thing about this hotel is that for almost $200 a night they can't even give you a free cup of coffee,0
I like the building| not too big of a hotel. The room size was good too.  It was adequately clean in rooms and hallways.  Dislikes:  No microwaves in rooms. Had to go all the way down to lobby restaurant to use one very small cheap microwave. The refrigerator was not plugged in as we thought and our food spoiled overnight.  The air conditioners are Very Very Loud and I'm not a light sleep.  One desk person couldn't find my reservations under Travelocity and had to wait for another person to figure it out.  The meals in the Restaurant is over priced and not tasteful. Better to eat out or use Uber Eats.  Travelocity did not mention the $100 deductible per night as I recall.  This you had to pay on checking in.  Its Valet Parking Only!  Wasn't aware of that also.,1
All the amenities were available,1
Staff was awesome!  Wanda made the check in process a pleasure.,1
Very nice| spacious| would go back,1
Satisfying,1
The worse services and bad costumer services i had to much problem with bad costumer services not profecional at sll its so frustrated,0
I was promise free parkin with my stay that wasn't true I had to pay $90 for 3 days 3 nights,1
room was smelling wet mold on pillow and bed sheets,0
THE BED WAS BEYONDD COMFYYY OMG,1
I ABSOLUTELY enjoyed my stay at the HILTON..From the staff|  to the rooms|  to the food and hospitality.. Everything was EXCELLENT.. I just wished I could've stayed longerüòÉ,1
We really enjoyed our stay at the hotel. It was right off the expressway and easy to get into the city. The hotel and room was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful.,1
I stayed here two nights prior to my departure from JFK airport.  I specifically chose the Hilton JFK because of its proximity to JFK| and the fact it was a Hilton and I felt there would be a higher level of service. The staff were all very friendly and the first night was great.  The second night was a different story.  I woke up about 1:30 in the morning chocking.  I was coughing heavily and realized that my room was filled with a strong odor. I realized that the smell was coming from the venting system|  Moreover| the smell was clearly the smell of marijuana. Now| what someone does in their room is their business| but when it affects me in my room| then it becomes mine.  I called the front desk clerk and he was very apologetic and offered to send me an air freshener| which he admitted would do little but otherwise there was nothing he said he could do. He said that the smell could be coming from anywhere on the floor and that more than likely the occupants were smoking in their and blowing the smoke into the vent.  He did not offer to change rooms but said he would speak with his manager in the morning and make note in their system. I opened the window as much as I could and tried to go back to sleep. The next day I woke up with a searing head and feeling sick.  I spoke to the desk clerk who was again apologetic and who said she would speak to the manager.  I also emailed the manager and have not received the courtesy of even a response almost a week later.,0
The hotel was very nice quiet after hours.,1
Really nice| felt comfortable in this hotel. Superb experience.,1
TV in room was not working well. Missed NBA game last night. Called for help and no one came.,1
The staff was exceptional. I was a little disappointed in the quality of  how hotel was maintained. I expected better quality from Hilton.,1
I love everything about this hotel,1
Everything about this property is great. I am from Jamaica and it is easy for me to get to my family in the area or head to Brooklyn.,1
This hotel is great and convenient. I always stay here.,1
The hotel was easy to locate| very clean| nice size rooms and very comfy beds. Lobby area closes at 10 am so not food or drink| parking is valet only 27.00 per day. Had a very early flight so could not partake of breaksfast that was paid for in price.,1
We liked the shower| the shower head was powerful!,1
Clean and well decorated.,1
The front desk staff especially Ms. Griffin kept me from having a total melt down during my stay.  I was completely stressed and they made sure I was ok and had everything I needed.,1
I have stayed here every few weeks as I fly in to see my girlfriend. I cannot believe that you have to pay to park at a hotel you are paying for anyway. Additionally| the past two times| the hallway smelled like marijuana (very strong odor) and the A/C unit sounded like it was rumbling out of the wall. I'm not one to complain| but I don't think I would want to stay there as I keep flying back to NY every few weeks.,0
Diamond at the front desk was very pleasant. She is always so nice and friendly every time we stay their.,1
It was an all round great stay. Water and masks always available no charge and very friendly staff.,1
No microvave in the room and no drinking water | one toilet paper in the room for four persons during our stay.,1
I waited for one hour for the van to come pick me up at federal there were seven of us we are business people we would've taken a cab had we known that we would had to wait that long we found out once we got to the hotel that the van and it was only two were picking up airline crew members come on Hilton we know that they have a contract but you should want to haveThe business travel back the people at the hotel were wonderful but you're only sending them up for failure they heard complaint after complaint after complaint that is not fair you need more ground transportation JFK airport is too busy for two Vance you need a third on,1
Lovely inside but area is a bit rough looking. Overall| a good value.,1
The first room the air condition unit was above the door and when it came on it sound like a loud dump truck engine running.  Also| when we flushed the to toilet| it continue to run| we tried shaking the handle and it didn't stop. We arrived after midnight and was too tired to  call the front desk that night and decided we would just shut the bathroom door and deal with it| needless to say| didn't get any rest all night.  When the air came on it was loud and when it shut off the sound of the water running from the toilet.  The TV had to be played at a loud volume in order to hear it while the air condition was running and when it shut off the TV would be too loud | finally I just left the volume low and listened when the air shut off.  Thenext morning we complained| they did change our room. The bathroom situation was fixed | however the loud air condition was still there.,0
Positives: Great service| clean room| free basic Wifi in room| free airport shuttle| bar and restaurant on lobby level is convenient (but expensive).Negatives: No breakfast included for basic room (not sure if more expensive rooms have breakfast included)| not enough (or any) wall outlets in the room| the outlets in the lamps seemed slow to charge my cell phones and battery packs.,1
What I like about the property it was nice and clean and it wasn't too busy. I would like if they had the pool up and running because it was very hot and also the room should have a microwave because when you're traveling with kids you need to warm stuff up for the kids.,1
Staff was very personal & helpful. I had a lot of problems using my executive floor key in one of the elevators. & I didn't know the pool wasn't accessible. But| i enjoyed my stay. I didn't expect to have to pay $25 a night for parking though. That was unfair. Finding that out during checkin. Considering all the deposits daily & the $16 dollars a day for breakfast. Never experience so many extra fee added on checkin. For a trip I already paid for months in advance.,1
The hotel is conveniently located.  The staff is very gracious.  The rooms and the general areas are very clean and the bed was super comfortable. In spite of the large number of guests it was quiet.   The only thing that was unfortunate cannot be the hotel's fault.  They had a lovely bar and restaurant area but| due to NYC rules| they were open ONLY for take-out and the menu was limited.  This was a family event and we could not gather as we wished.  We truly hope NYC begins to allow the hotels to do what the do best!,1
Booked a suite was told by Valet it was $50 per car but to ‚Äúgive him‚Äù $30 got to the room and it was dirty garbage left in the can and a rotten apple left in the table. Was then told by housekeeping they could offer me an already free breakfast or 15% off the bill,0
the facilities were good| as was the service.  I give them four stars,1
Just  pleasant and clean,1
Run down property .. nothing works | cockroach in the room,0
We used this hotel as an overnight place to stay for airport service.  It was close and convenient to JFK.  Rooms were clean and beds were very comfortable.  Parking was tight and we used on street parking about a block away.,1
Easy to find and quick check in. Front desk staff were very helpful with check in.,1
For it's size and Name I was disappointed parking wasn't available on site,1
It was very clean.,1
The staff was rude except for shuttle driver who was a breath of fresh air.There was a mechanical system noise that kept us up all night!,0
It was amazing and very useful  to get at time to the airport .,1
The gentleman who checked us in was very helpful and accommodating.,1
The hotel was really nice check in was quick the staff did practice very good social distancing hand sanitizer throughout the hotel etc. However Parking was a nightmare!!!! at the evening hours i had to circle the hotel parking lot and outside around the hotel almost an hour before someone pulled out of space that definitely needs to be addressed it was horrible I was exhausted all i wanted to do was go to my room but you couldn't due to the parking situation.,1
Even tho they have free parking but it's never enough so if you come park and take ubers because after hours you'll be looking for parking for hours ...then they have There shuttle buses block and three parking spots where the guess could have parked so annoying but everyone was nice,1
Near airport| heater is too loud| not so great neighborhood,1
The hotels was very dirty. Stain in the blanket| hair in the towel. Ppl hanging out outside the lobby all night. Its is not peaceful at all. With kids donot stay their. Ppl are weird noises. Just don't stay here at all.,0
DONT NOT STAY HERE!!! They over charge you and try to take more of your money I never had a issue we Expedia this hotel is Horrible,0
Beautiful clean hotel.   Employees are very courteous and helpful.,1
Everything was great especially the food and staff,1
Thank you everything was good except your bath top drain was bad when taking shower was not draining super slow asa you finish showering the water reach above 15 inch,1
Decent room. Clean. They put stickers over the door after a room is sanitized so you know no one else has been there. The main issue was the hvac unit. Incredibly loud to the point it woke us up every time it turned on| every 1-2 hours. I usually sleep through anything - planes| traffic| usual NY city sounds but this woke me up. Turning it off and the room got too hot.,1
This is a great hotel. I really enjoyed my stay . This was the first hotel I stayed at that parking was free on site . I hope to come back very soon .,1
It was nice and clean| staff at the front desk wasn't too attentive to the line for check in but once was helped they were nice and fast,1
The property is ideally situated for easy access to Airport and highway.,1
Enjoyed our stay for Valentine's weekend| the place was clean and comfortable!!,1
The hotel is very convenient location to JFK and the shuttle system works well.  The rooms are clean and relatively modern.  The lobby restaurant is good for breakfast (take out only due to COVID).  We were happy with the Hilton and the price was reasonable for a superior hotel in NY.,1
I liked the room.  cleanliness| cosiness and comfort.  Nice staff.  Good service.  Excellent shuttle drivers.,1
Clean safe  staff are drivers of shuttles are helpful & friendly,1
Check in was fast| easy| and friendly.  Hotel clean and free parking.,1
Nothing it was horrible The woman at the front desk was very rude and unhelpful worst experience ever,0
Very convenient to JFK. THe shuttle runs frequently. Staff is pleasant and accommodating.,1
I checked out within a hour of being there it was filthy,0
Always A Pleasant Stay Whenever I Visit,1
Great service and rooms are nice| grounds are nice,1
Website said it had a pool| got there and they said sorry it's closed. I ask about a discount since my kids were going to be disappointed now and the desk clerk said no and ask if I wanted to stay at another hotel? The room was alright but not very clean| sheets had stains on them| just not what I expected from a Hilton.,0
It was really wonderful staying at the Hilton. I'll definitely do it again.,1
Great layover near the airport.,1
I went to this hotel during the coronavirus and I couldn't have been happier.,1
Rooms were clean and comfortable... Bed was amazing...very spacious,1
Excellent Staff . Very Professional| Courteous| and Accommodating . It was a Pleasure ...,1
Everything was perfect and organized well clean and set properly,1
What I did like was it was quiet what I didn't like was that I had to go to the front desk to get my room cleaned it was 2 housekeepers on my floor I asked them both if they had my room and they both said no so the next day one of the housekeepers was on my floor I asked did she have my room she said no so I had to go to the front desk to ask to have my room cleaned I checked n that Thursday and I didn't get room service until that Saturday...,0
Professional | Courteous and Very Accommodating ..!,1
I didn't go becuase I wasn't feeling well. I was still charged,0
Accommodations where good as always. Still brought my Lysol. Was surprised the hotel was full,1
Covid cancelled room service booo. Really enjoy room service when staying at hilton,1
Convenient to JFK airport nice services and friendly staff,1
Great customer service.  No issues with check in process.  Room was spacious and clean.Only issue was that front desk did not ask if I was a Hilton member which I was.Other than that it was a good experience.,1
The stay was great| but the room we booked was not accurately described in hotels.com app causing us to have to buck sn extra room at the time of check-in. The description ssid that the room accommodates up to 3 children snd that there is a sofa or rollaway bed available.  When we reached the hotel they said none of their rooms have that availability.,1
Pool closed which is reason it was booked and it's proximity to airport.,1
The heating unit in the room was so loud and vibrating erratically that we were concerned it might explode. Room smelled and they attempted to conceal with air freshener.,0
Like the professionalism of the staff. They were all nice and willing to help and answer any questions I had. The bus service was also a huge help to the airport.,1
Hotel was good. The only thing is the $25 dollar a day for parking is a joke !!! And not fair at all.,1
The location of the hotel was what we needed to late checkin and early departure.   The free facility of the courtesy bus made the transfer easy,1
Staff is very helpful. Current construction makes access difficult,1
The hotel looks good from outside but the room was not made up at all and after calling the front desk they had an issue in getting it cleaned So after a little argument they gave us another room nd such a pain going to another room after driving for 10 hrs.  Never had an issue like this at any Hilton but this time it was really bad,0
It had everything i needed during my trip. Food| drink| etc.,1
The overall experience was very pleasant.  The typical Hilton standards,1
Everything one needs is on the property.  Nice Restaurant| bar| Convenient store| business center. The rooms are clean and spacious and they offer a complimentary| reliable airport shuttle.,1
Speedy staff and clean room - just what I needed for my night.,1
Nice hotel clean friendly staff ... overall good.,1
Got the room for a layover before taking a flight to Miami. I didn't really get to sleep in room but it turned out as a great spot to gather in order to catch the next flight.,1
Noise from elevator was unbelievable terrible.Room looks like a cheap motel.This for USD 300 per night.Worst Hilton in the world,0
Easy to get to.  Close to airport.  Great staff. Excellent experience.,1
The staff was very friendly. From the valet| to the shuttle| to house keeping| and room service. All were friendly| and caring. Even the associates running the gift shop that is in the hilton| but not a part of the hilton was very friendly. Everything is nice and clean| very comfortable beds and bedding| nice shampoo| body was| soap| and conditioner. If you call the front desk and ask for more| they do not bring just one more| they bring you quite a bit| enough to meet your needs. The free shuttle to the airport runs 24/7. Every 30 minutes. Its a beautiful hotel in a quiet area. Very nice. I would definitely stay again. We stayed for 9 days| so we were able to stay long enough to be able to give a fair review.,1
There's was food and underwear under the beds. Seems like they never cleaned underneath. The bathrooms as well. Finger prints on the Mirrors and dirty carpets. The power outlet in the walls two of them where hanging out of the socket.,0
The manager said you guys will give me back my money being awake all night with noise,0
Kept up all night with noise from dodgy pipework. Not impressed... would have slept better in the airport terminal!,0
It was fine. The rooms are spacious. I would stay there again,1
We always stay ar Hilton Jamaica| JFK Airport.Friendly service minded staff and clean rooms a good restaurant and close to Airport we find this the best option when traveliling thru New York.,1
Friendly staff; outdated property; decent breakfast,1
The rooms and gym equipment are pretty old. Time for an update. But the staff were wonderful and the airport shuttle was perfect!,1
It was close to many places of interest but a building is being constructed next to it so it is a little inconvenient.,1
Good propertyBut no bathrobes or minibar in the room,1
Great hotel for spending one night before travelling through JFK only thing we called to check check in policy as it seemed not clear what was latest check in time with no extra fee and were told from 4 to 8 pm so make sure you make it there within this time frame. There is a parking vallet fee of 25$. We dined in it was nice did not try breakfast at restaurant. We did not use the pool but seemed nice. .,1
Everything was nice. We did have to leave the pool because of chlorine levels not being up and were asked to come back in an hour we did and the pool was open,1
The hotel staff are great and location for airport too. However neither myself or my young family were able to get any sleep after arriving at midnight following a long flight. The air conditioning unit was ridiculously loud. Sounded more like an industrial generator. Shame as everything else was good.,0
Although we were only staying for a total of 5 hours i decided to book the Hilton as we normally have reasonable comfort in the brand's accommodation. Unfortunately this hotel was overpriced| had a room that someone had been smoking in perviously| an air conditioner that had an angry mind of its own and airport shuttle didn't arrive on its designated scheduled time. Had we had the time to complain or relocate we would have. Unfortunate as i normally am an advocate for Hilton.,0
The service at check in and check out was super friendly.,1
The carpets were dirty but overall very comfortable and easy access to jfk airport.,1
AC is so loud we couldn't sleep at nightWe had to turn it off and sweat all night. The smell in the room is very bad and moldy|We move to another room but still the same You smell it as soon as you go into the room. Not recommended not a good place to stay.,0
Very efficient and accommodating front desk good rooms| beds,1
This is the perfect place to rest between flights or on your way to another adventure. The location is convenient to the airport only. There is really nothing around but residential. We really enjoyed our stay to reenergize in the pool and the executive lounge between Europe and California. Rooms and service were wonderful!!,1
Clean spacious. friendly| good bathroom products| complementary water and fruit,1
We booked our stay at this hotel as we THOUGHT it was the best option at JFK. We arrived at 2:30am exhausted from our flight. The room| 617| had LOUD air fan sounds!  The AC worked fine| but the loud fan noise was the worst!  I literally took a sound video to prove it to the front desk but we had no time to stop as we had to catch our next flight. No one slept! Worst experience ever-terrible start to our trip. The good news is that things can only get better. Booooooooo,0
The worst hotel I have stayed in ever,0
Good facility near airport for short staying| big and clean room| basic restaurant - for 1 night staying is very good.,1
Reception area was nice| but the rest of the decor was outdated. That doesn't matter too much| there were a few things wrong with my experience. The heating system was so loud that it woke me up literally every time it kicked on. It sounded like an industrial dryer was next to my head| and ensured that I only got 3 hours of sleep. The door to the bathroom was peeling at the bottom because of dampness| the sink drained incredibly slowly| and it was impossible to shower in anything other than freezing or boiling water. Also| after a long day of traveling| I wanted to get some food. The room service was not worth the money. I paid $66 for terrible| dry mashed potatoes| limp and cold asparagus| a mediocre steak| and a disappointing dessert. I'm not expecting perfection from room service| but I had better food on the plane that day. For the price| at least put something other than dry| bad potatoes in my mashed potatoes.,0
Very clean. All the staff were very helpful and pleasant.   Very convenient for a overnight before getting on the plane the following day.,1
Great for overnight stay however old building needs renovation.,1
Clean and close to airport. Pillows quite firm and not comfortable. Toiletries limited. WiFi easy to access and consistent|,1
Great hotel very clean and very polite staff only problem I had was the fact that it wasn't mentioned that the pool is only seasonal,1
AC/Fan in room was extremely loud and kept me up all night. I was overnighting for one night only after flying for over 16 hours and was up all night due to noises everytime the AC fan came one. I told the receptionist in the morning and she said sorry to hear that. Was not the response i was expecting.,0
Nice place to spend a night and get rest between flights,1
Very good service and very helpful. Clean and pleasant  stay,1
Excellent stay for a night of layover - highly recommended,1
The room and the seating areas everything was clean,1
The building looks like it needs a complete refurbishment. Stuck in a time warp. Air con unit in Room very noisy.Lift nearby made high pitched sound.Had an adjoining room which wasn't requested and meant we could hear everything going on next door.Great staff though.,0
Not very good for being a Hilton. Heaters in the room sounds like a plane taking off every time it would kick on| TV reception was all blurry| The tub drain was broken| would like fill the tub| and once it did close it would not stay open again. And finally the property states it has an indoor pool. Well the indoor pool is closed from November until May. At the property they say it's an indoor/outdoor pool with just glass enclosure around it,0
The hotel is what it is for a one night stay to catch a plane. It clearly gets hard use.,1
The lady at the front desk| an African American lady| very professional and knows her job.,1
Outstanding friendly and attentive staff from shuttle| check-in| restaurant| to house-keeping.,1
I will stay again....................................,1
The indoor pool was closed for the season.? Very disappointed 12 year old.,1
Very friendly staff| and good service. Shuttle to airport was frequent with excellent service.Would stay again .,1
The air conditioning was VERY loud!! Other than that great room| very comfortable| would stay again.,1
the only problem was a lot of noise in the construction of the side| very loud,1
This was my 4th or 5th stay at this location.The stay was generally excellent (as always). However| on this particular occasion| there was construction taking place on an adjacent parcel of real estate. Unfortunately| I was awakened by the sounds and vibrations caused by the foundation work that was being undertaken next door. The sensation that was caused was disconcerting. While I understand that Hilton has no control over suchconstruction| I would have appreciated being informed of the possibility of such. I did bring this to the attention of an employee at the front desk. Much to my chagrin| he did not offer any accommodation. His reaction was less than ideal. I do intend to come back.,1
Wonderful hotel. Professional staff| clean and comfortable. The only problem I encountered was issues with certain cable channels. I called for the issue to be fixed| and they switched the cables which cleared certain channels but others still didn't work. However| the servicemen stated that the issue was with the cable company. This issue should be addressed promptly due to the amount of money patrons spend daily to stay at the Hilton.,1
I like this Hilton NY JFK airport hotel because It is good location and quite place for staying,1
Its was a terrible experience for me. We didnt even stay we had to lodge in another hotel close by. Hampton. It was a sad story and i must get my refund back ....,0
The room accommodation  was excellent as well as the room service. The staff were very courteous and helpful.  My only complaint was the breakfast buffet. Not very tasty.  Overall a good experience.,1
The employees made this hotel stay incredible.  Cant say enough about the great service we received.,1
Lovely and caring staff| who helped us check in early. The hotel is great. The only issue was vey loud construction in the area| day and night. The noise was a bit annoying.,1
So 4 stars for appointment| 1 star for service| 1 star for amenities that should have been included in room charge (parking| breakfast) or functioning properly (HVAC).,0
Great location close to the airport| with restaurant and Statbucks.  Shuttle service from/to airport included!,1
My be was amazingly comfy| best sleep ever and the price was amazing.Just had breakfast at the restaurant and it is a reasonable pice and delicious.,1
Welcoming front desk staff| attentive bartender| and on time early morning shuttle to JFK. Perfect for a late checkin and early morning flight.,1
I have stay there in the past and had been pleased,1
The room was clean| people were pleasant I would definitely recommend this hotel| I've stayed at many hotels in New York and this is the best one I've stayed at so far.,1
Very convenient location and shuttle service to the airport.,1
The aircon was noisy. Other than that| everything else was fine.,1
Near JFK| very comfortable|  big room and very kind personnel,1
The check in agent was pleasant and I asked for a room with an airport view which I got. Other than that everything was horrible. The shower let water all over the floor no matter how u aimed the shower head. The restaurant was super busy and I guess that is why the service was horrible. It was so bad that the manager had to take my order after asking me twice if I've been helped. The food wasn't good at all how can you mess up buffalo wings? But they did give you free bottle water. The shuttle was a carnival with way too many people trying to ride. You would think someone would take note of how many people requested a shuttle the night before. So I just took an Uber. Honestly| for the service given | the dated room| etc. Hilton should not be charging a premium. The price for this property should be motel 6. Oh and forget about watching tv| their provider which I expect is dish sucked. Most of the channels didn't work and those that did were always freezing and reloading.,0
TO OLD...PICTURES OF THE WEB ARE NOT THE SAME...THEY OFFERED BATHTUB....ONLY SHOWER IN MY ROOM,1
Nice| convenient hotel to stay at when flying out of JFK.,1
It was a nice respite on our return trip from Europe.   Clean| comfortable| and quiet.,1
very convenient to JFK| onsite restaurant a plus| fast check-in| convenient shuttle service,1
The young man at the front desk upon checking in was VERY RUDE!  And even when I told how I felt he was not apologetic.,0
Convenience to airport and public transportation. Well assisted from staff for any services requested,1
Shuttle to the airport was free and got us to check in well before our time,1
Friendly staff.  Efficient check in.  Nice restaurant.,1
Very nice and convenient to the airport. Not many dining options but except the hotel dining room.,1
Nice hotel convenient to JFK airport. A great restaurant / bar with staff who went above and beyond.,1
Decent| older hotel very close to JFK airport. But not too close that you hear the planes. Love having the airport shuttle. Not too far away from a subway (Jamaica Van Wyck station) but must uber/lyft to it as it's about 3-4 miles away. Hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. Hotel was clean| but can tell it needs a renovation soon. Beds are comfortable. Air conditioner is kinda loud| but works. Thankfully tho it didn't keep us up at night.,1
We needed a room for the night between flights.  The hotel was great!  Had dinner and cocktails in the bar where the food and service were excellent.  Not my first choice if I were there to sightsee| but for what we needed it was perfect.,1
I used the hotel as I had to overnight close to JFK in order to catch a 07.55am flight.  However| I was pleasantly surprised by the overall quality of the staff| the room and| especially| the food and beverage service.  Dining alone in a busy restaurant was even a please.  The reception staff and the airport shuttle driver were particularly helpful and generous of spirit.   Restored my faith in airport hotels!,1
The staff is pleasant| friendly and helpful. The rooms and facilities are dated. Not a great bargain for the price.,1
Over all the hotel does a good job| lobby| restaurant and there are many guests staying every night. It is a good hotel and it is close to the airport.,1
The staff was extremely gracious - even when we arrived at 2am - they had the shuttle for us right after we called. The room was comfortable and quiet (considering we were in NY) - We stayed on our trip out of the country and another night when we returned. The second night the rooms AC was extremely noisy - they moved us without a question. Would recommend to all!,1
It was our first time stay at Hilton. What a pleasant experience we had. Location was convenient located nearby airport| all the staffs from the front desk to shuttle service staffs are wonderful. We arrived late around 9:30pm. Front desk a lady named Justin helped us to check in. She made checking in so smoothly for family with little ones and elderly. She is the bestüòä,1
Location and 24 hr shuttleCleanNice barNice restaurant,1
Very good hotel| close to the airport| a bus to the airport every 30 minuets.,1
Something was biting me in the night| I think it was bedbugs,0
Great hotel with reasonable price| staff was very friendly and helpful. Food in restaurant was so delicious that my daughter said it was probably the best food she had ever tried.,1
Location from airport which easy to reach by shuttle,1
Efficiency in handling large groups with lots of luggage,1
Hotel staff were disinterested|lazy and rude. This from front desk to restaurant to housekeeping. The property itself is old and dated. The HVAC system in the room was so loud that it made it difficult to hear the television|communicate with other people in the same room and/or even sleep. I will never stay at this hotel again.,0
I had a really nice stay! Room was comfortable and quiet!,1
Tired run down and smelly.  There is a damp musty smell in the hallways and the room.  The pool light is laying on the deck of the pool with the wire disappearing down into the murky water.,0
Only stayed one night before my flight - food was average but all in all comfortable enough.,1
AC and fan were incredibly loud. Bed was comfy though.,1
I spent very good time with nice and good hotel.,1
We took an Uber to the Hilton from JFK. We just needed a place to stay overnight that was close to the car rental company so we could start our trip to the Hamptons the next day. This is a very basic hotel but does the trick. There is a shuttle back and forth but it involved waiting.,1
Close to expressway| shopping and beaches,1
Good for an overnight at airport. Close location to airport and shuttle to and from hotel was very prompt| Hotel is older but in good condition. Clean. Bed was a bit old and tired and saggy.,1
After getting in later than we wanted after flying in and picking up our van at the long term parking| tired| hungry and weary from the trip the front desk checked us in in no time and gave us a menu for a 24HR always open restaurant that delivers to the hotel room for our hungry kids.,1
Bath towels smelt damp and stale.  Everything else was great.,1
We called 4 times to the front desk without any luck.,1
The room service was great| as was the cleanliness and comfort of the room.,1
Free shuttle bus,1
the shower did not work good,1
Good location near the JFK airport.,1
HOTEL MUY VIEJO| SUCIO| EL VALET NI SIQUIERA LE IMPORTO CUANDO LLEGAMOS TUVE QUE IR A BUSCARLO PARA QUE ME RECIBIERA LA CAMIONETA| EL BEL BOY NI SUS LUCES YO TUVE QUE BAJAR TODO EL EQUIPAJE.,0
transportation  service is good.,1
Good location w plenty of dining options within a short walk. Front desk was very responsive| room was a good size & in-room coffee maker was a homerun. Business office also came in handy.,1
"Room pictures are nothing like advertised.  Also| beware of the city view option when selecting a room| we never did get one and when we asked for the room the answer was| ""it is what it is"".  Kudos Hilton!",0
Everything was fine just a broken light and we had an ADA room bc I'm wheelchair bound but there was no roll in shower. Everyone was nice and pleasant. Thanks!,1
Staff very friendly.,1
It was a great hotel. Very friendly staff. Make sure that you ask for the parking coupon for the garage| otherwise you will be charged full price.,1
Room and hallway desperately needed to be vacuumed. Handles on furniture falling off. Sliding bathroom door was off track. Outside of hotel had garbage smell,1
Location.,1
Friendly staff/ Rooms were clean but just average. Requested city view but had view of what appeared to be a fashion warehouse building. The staff was great and moved us to a higher floor when rooms were available. However still had no city view. The move did get my family all on the same floor. The first two nights we were on 3 different floors.,1
Paid for view but didn't have the view at all.,0
I stayed only for one night although i was booked for two nights. I thought i will see the city view as advertised. But i was placed on the 6th floor even though I requested for a higher floor.,0
Hotel was nice overall and I would come back. Parking garage attached to the hotel is not affiliated and the one they are affiliated with is 1.5 blocks away (advertised on site parking). Staff was friendly and hotel was clean and in a good location. There were no drink vending machines| so come prepared!,1
The place were very clean| and near to everything.,1
Great place!,1
Truly lousy room location within building| under sidewalk shed and looking at outdoor tables. No light and loud in am.  Hotel was not full| I asked.  Should be the absolute last room sold.,0
Although I went to the front desk every day asking for somebody to clean my room and change the towels | they never went.they are so disorganized in terms of room service and guest simple request. I stay for three nights and never received not even an apology for not cleaning mu room.,0
I had an inconvenient with front desk employee| no courtesy at all.Next day another employee fixed the situation.,0
A nice hotel in a great location! Close to restaurants| subway| and it's in walking distance of several landmarks. Although the room was small| (if you're used to NYC hotel rooms| it wouldn't phase you) it had everything we needed| and it was clean. I would definitely stay here again!,1
The enterance key pad wasnt charged which cause a problem getting in the roomfrom returning from evening outing .,1
I liked that you need your room key to access building and elevator.  Search for parking before hand.,1
It was in the perfect location for our purpose in the city. The room was very clean| great city view and covid guidelines carried out throughout the hotel.,1
Close to 34 St.| public transportation| dining| and major tourist spots.  This hotel follows COVID-19 protocol| and has polite customer service.  I even got a city view with my room| which was beautiful to look at night.  Only thing that sucked was that their restaurant was closed| but hey| New York is a food hub all over.,1
Fairly well located. Rooms were small but the price was very good.,1
Overall great and fantastic location next to Korea town and Curry Hill. Staff is fantastic - great service.,1
It was a great hotel. I highly recommend it and would stay again. Off street parking was nearby| but cost almost as much as the hotel.,1
The hotel staff Ck-in and Ck-out was fantastic!! My Husband encounter a dislikes from one staff..Other then that the stay was pleasant| Hotel a little out dated...Parking is a nightmare..Housekeeping was amazing and fast with sheets and towels on request!! The hotel had spectacular views of Manhattan a night...Refrigerator and microwave was a plus.....Price! was great! for New York..midtown Manhattan.....safety with key..super plus too....‚≠êÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è,1
It was good. The bed sheet could be a little bit cleaner though,1
Very convenient location| close to Empire State| Koreatown| and Bryant Park. Helpful staff. However| I can smell the next room guests smoking cigarettes and weed.,1
Dark dingy room. Uncomfortable,0
It was a great stay!!! The room was extremely comfortable and room service/customer service were wonderful!! Would definitely come again!!,1
The hotel was nice.  Rooms were basic but functional.  There was some food remnants and trash under the bed from the previous guests| and the coffee machine was broken| but I wasn't bothered by that.  In a perfect world they wouldn't charge $75 for a late check-out when the hotel was almost empty because of Covid; but I understand it is policy.  I woud stay again if I needed to be in the area and the price was right.,1
stayed here one night & couldn't have asked for better| fast & efficient service! patrick ( I think that was his name?) at the front desk was very kind & made check in and check out a breeze for me & made sure we had what we needed so thank you! definitely would stay again :),1
Terrible.  AC turms off in the middle of the night.  Do not go here.,0
Terrible.  AC turms off in tue middle of the night.  Do not go here.,0
The hotel was very clean and spacious| in a perfect area of Manhattan. The staff were very polite. I had a great stay with my wife.,1
This hotel is awesome| the staff is great. Front desk service is very helpful during this time of COVID-19,1
Value for the Location. Clean room and convenience for the business traveler.,1
Everything was great.  Perfect location. Great staff.,1
good location| but the card keys were wonky and didn't read all the time.,1
The hotel was modern and clean and the location was excellent. The rooms were also larger than I expected with all of the amenities that you could need. Staff were always very friendly and helpful should you need them!,1
It's the fourth time that I am coming back to this hotel and I think it says it allGREAT HOTEL,1
the hotel is really good | the service and the amenities | please check that the hotel dosent have a full city view because all other buildings around are taller | expedia sells the rooms with city view wich we cant have and charge more money | I am so mad and dessapointed about this | even when the manager moved me from floor 16 to 21 still only had a parcial view to some buildings . all I saw was windows from the other buildings across from the street .location is good,0
Location!The surrounding area seemed like it was constant construction,1
Liked: Good room| very clean| good breakfest. Everyone very nice and helpful!Didn't like: Small beds. Location is not bad| but could be better. Should have chosen the other Hilton Garden Inn.,1
Location is great| subway stop just steps away. Room and hotel extremely clean. Complimentary cookies and coffee every day at reception.,1
The location was excellent.  The downtown number 6 subway is right outside the door!  It was much quieter than other properties and we stayed during a very busy time!  Breakfast was excellent and the mattress was nice and the feather pillows were amazing.  I don't have a single complaint!  We will stay here again on our next visit.,1
Fabulous. Great location and very restful. Close to the subway and attractions.,1
Amazing location and staff! Will definitely be staying here again!,1
It was great,1
We arrived in the hotel at about 4 pm. I washed up| and to my surprise| the sink would not drain|.or very slowly. I tried to call the front desk| and realized that the cord for the phone was broken| at the clip. I called them up| and I them about the problem| and they said that done within the hour. Since I was leaving| to go out| I said okay. After four hour They fixed the sink but the phone,1
Staff was very responsive and took care of us! The hotel was in a great location for midtown| right by Koreatown so lots of delicious food nearby.,1
Good location| clean rooms | not too happy about the $250 dollar charge to my card though when I had no intention of purchasing any extras | I've now to wait a week to have money returned to card | it may not even be the same amount due to exchange rate . Totally in necessary and never experienced at any other hotel I've stopped at .,1
I liked the efficient design of the room and bathroom| seemed to be recently updated| though room somewhat small. It was helpful to have the microwave and small refrigerator| but the coffeemaker definitely did not work after several tries. Room was very quiet and pleasant. Staff was excellent. Location allowed walking to many midtown attractions. I will probably stay there again.,1
Very spacious and clean.Very helpful and courteous staff,1
Great location| good staff and clean rooms.  Don't buy the daily breakfast option.  Food was subpar.  Everything else was great,1
Excellent hotel with convenient location| friendly and efficient staff| comfortable accommodations at a competitive price.,1
When we checked in| they said that the ‚Äúcity view‚Äù double room we booked didn't exist. They said that none of their double rooms have views due to a tall building on that side of the hotel and that the website was wrong. OK| fine| nothing they can do about that but at least update the incorrect website so that people know what they're booking. Housekeeping skipped us the second day so we requested new towels and wash cloths.  We had to call and ask twice before a staff member brought us a stack of literally wadded up towels.  The room was tiny. It looked clean but did not smell fresh.  The location is very convenient. Still| would never choose this hotel again.,0
Very helpful great location,1
The room is in need of new compact on the wall| heating and air conditioning unit. We we're woken up to the on/off fan notices and rattling. The unit really takes up a lot of space.,1
Conveient| comfortable| very pleasant desk staff,1
Nice hotel for NYC.Small room| but clean.Housekeeping pounded in door at 8:30am and walked right in while we were sleeping! Not happy about that!!!,1
Staff was helpful for any and all requests. Nice room| delicious breakfast| good location.,1
Clean room| friendly| helpful staff. Overall a great experience.,1
Great location to subway and sights. Really clean and stuff was nice. This was our second time staying here.,1
Nice small quiet hotel Very cleanConvenient to everything Subway with in walking distance I'll book again,1
"Overall| we had a very pleasant stay here. The pros: the staff were all wonderful. They were very accommodating| and helpful without any sense of being put out. The coffee (in the morning) and tea & ice water (in the afternoon) is a nice add on for a lobby with very limited space. The rooms are nice enough - our TV was a good size (though never used) and it was nice to have a fridge and microwave| though we also never used them. We needed to switch rooms| and the request was accommodated by Agnes without the slightest sense that I was making anything harder for the staff. We brought down our bags the next morning| and by the next afternoon| we got keys to our room and the staff had already deposited our baggage. Housekeeping was impeccable. The cons: Our first night| we were in a room right next to the elevator| and basically everything was wrong with it. While it was larger than our subsequent room| the air conditioning didn't work (and windows obviously don't open on the 27th floor)| the wallpaper seemed haphazardly painted on| there was a tiny television with a very odd dresser setup| and while I'm fine with a small room| my side of the bed was nearly impossible to get in and out of. I guess I wouldn't know whether those rooms are representative of the whole hotel| but I'd advise not accepting a room ending in ""00"" - they seem to have different setups. The A/C situation wasn't great throughout the stay| and I just expect decent climate control for the amount paid.",1
Great location. Clean. Updated. Friendly staff.Room was small but efficient.,1
Great location. Very friendly and helpful staff. We would definitely visit again.,1
Great location| clean and decent size rooms for NYC,1
Very user friendly and clean. Near all in NYC and easily accessible,1
Nice hotel in great location. The room was nice and a good size too. Unfortunately the plumbing was terrible! While the hotel responded quickly to requests to fix things| a big hotel like that should have better plumbing/water pressure. The heat makes terrible noises too so sleeping was quite difficult. The staff was very nice though and tried to address things quickly.,0
Very clean if smallish rooms. We had booked two rooms as we were a family of two. One room had a spacious bathroom with an overhead shower and a mobile/ hand held shower.The other room had a very small bathroom with just the overhead shower. Both bathrooms were spotlessly clean though with more than enough towels and toiletries. I had forgotten my toothbrush and this was provided to me upon calling reception. Even though we had booked the rooms days ahead| we were not given rooms high up. We were given rooms on 3rd and 5th floors respectively as such not on the same floor even though I asked them to do this as we were a family and wanted to stay together. The hotel is about a kilometre from Penn station. I'd give the whole experience a 4 out of 5.,1
Great location! Very clean Very friendly helpful staff,1
Very friendly and helpful staff.  The rooms were clean and modern. Shopping and restaurants are nearby and within walking distance. The only downturn was that there is no business center where you can print documents. The only way to print is to email it to the hotel and they will print it for you.,1
It was a good hotel not fancy but fancy with every you need to expend three nights at New York.,1
Hotel was very clean. comfortable for stay.Staff was very kind.recommend for NY trip,1
very loud noise starting at 7:00 with street construction after jus 3 hours of sleep. The hotel should have known about schedule construction work on the street early morning and not book rooms on that side . Or| at lest notify  guests .,0
Small room but very clean! I will take cleanliness over everything else. Thank you|,1
Great location| friendly staff. Had a fantastic stay in the City. The location can't be beat. We walked everywhere. The room was very neat and tidy and plenty of space for the three of us.,1
This property in central located of everything Friendly staff most helpful very clean.,1
Very friendly service.  Very clean.  Spectacular location.,1
Great location! Spent most of my time away from the hotel as a result of exploring the city but the little time I did spend was great.,1
Nice place to stay. Convenient to subway and other parts of newyork city.,1
This is very convenient to Mid town and a long walk to Soho. Definitely would stay again and it's  a bargain for Manhattan.,1
Excellent check in staff.  Room was very nice.  Breakfast was excellent.,1
Room was a bit on the small size for two - even in New York - but the staff was polite and professional| room was fresh and clean and price was excellent.  I'd go back in a minute.,1
Had to request a different room due to the smell inside. Moved rooms and safe didn't work| hotel said they had fixed it but it didn't work. On checkout no one asked how my stay was and couldn't be bothered to pass the time of day. No questions about Hilton Honours membership of which I am but found the room cheaper vis Hotels.com At $200 a night you expect more.,0
Hotel located in a quite area and yet it's very close to Times Square and all tourist spot in mid city which is full of people. It's a small building with small rooms but the staff is very accommodating.,1
liked the spacious room and bathroom. didn't like how outdated the bathroom was.,1
It was nice and convenient and a great place to do everything,1
Great location| modern| clean| great price| friendly staff.,1
Lobby was small.  Rooms ere pleasant.  Wsit times for elevators were acceptable.  The check in and check out were prompt.  The lobby was small however and felt at times fairly crowded.,1
The hotel was very clean| and the staff was spot on!  However| we found the location to be extremely loud.,1
everything was great. cleanliness good| breakfast was awesome. staff very responsive and solve all my issues. : bad things: our room view was horrible. when I look at outside from 6 floor| I just saw very old and nasty view of our old apartment fust in front of us|second issue was about laundry that I have to pay!!!!!! it is not I expected . it has to be free  while booking a room. lobby was small. the rest of Hilton garden inn was great. I enjoyed a lot,1
Great hotel!  Exceptional breakfast!,1
Staff was soooo friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The area was perfect. Would definitely stay again.,1
Outstanding service and value.  Spacious rooms and bathrooms.,1
It was great.,1
The rooms were comfortable. Noise level was not too bad. Location is great to get around city.,1
Need  variety on breakfast food,1
We were given room on 2nd floor with No view.,0
The property was in a great location| close to everything we wanted to do. Only downside was our water in the room stopped working for a few hours| but it did get fixed and we didn't have to change rooms.,1
Hotel is great but rooms are very small.,1
Room was clean.  City view was of fire escapes next door.  If you want a view go higher than 6 th floor.  Breakfast was ok.  Location is great for getting around city.,1
Like the Hotel and staff. Dislike restaurant staff.,1
Great location| 20 mins. walking distance to Times Square and safe and quiet area| there is a Subway entrance right across the street| no doubt I will book this hotel on my next visit.,1
Great. Hotel was excellent. Staff very polite| food good. Lovely atmosphere,1
The location was very convenient and the price great| too.,1
Overall| we had a good stay. Room was smaller than we anticipated| but it was really just a place to sleep. Key cards kept giving us issues and there wasn't a lot of space in general to put anything. Microwave and refrigerator was a plus. You get what you pay for| there are comparable hotels in terms of price around the area that are much more spacious however.  We could have been more comfortable| but service was top tier.,1
Nice and clean and reasonably priced.,1
Very nice room ... very clean and well maintained... would recommend for anyone ... will definitely use the Hilton properties for future travel !!,1
It was an excellent room and the staff was amazing.,1
The Hotel Staff were all very helpful!!!,1
It was Great|went to two twins vs Yankees games,1
I enjoyed my stay at the Hilton Garden Inn New York/ Midtown Park Ave.,1
Comfortable room. Clean and well located.,1
I booked the room for my adult granddaughter to fill a one-night gap between AirBNBs.  It was more than we can usually afford for one night| but very reasonable compared to others in that area.  We were happy that she was safe and comfortable there.  I had 2 occasions to phone the front desk staff| who were both very| very professional and helpful.,1
Great location. The only thing I would ask is that they pro-rate the parking beyond 24 hours.,1
Good location; attached restaurant very good; convenient parking.,1
Convenient location. Clean rooms. Quiet. Friendly staff.,1
We were celebrating our 24th wedding anniversary. The hotel staff were very nice. The hotel is Beautiful! We will definitely be coming back for another stay.,1
Great location| steps away from many nice Korean restaurants. Clean but really tiny room.,1
It was quiet| clean and location was everything walking distance to timesquare and subways,1
Room is smaller than I expected. Housekeeping is not very well| they didn't throw the garbage and clean mirror.,1
The front desk staff were so friendly and efficient. They made the experience that much better. They also suggested a brunch spot across the street Spoon Table & Bar and it was incredible! Also| Gregory's Coffee across the street was excellent.,1
I stayed in Hilton garden Inn for two nights!!! I reserved a double room with view and I have to say that everything was perfect!!!!! The room was spacious with huge bathroom and all the needed amenities!!!!I stayed on the 26 floor and the view was amazing!!!!!  I am working also in a big hotel in Athens so I have to say that everything was perfect!!! The hotel is located in a central position 3 minutes away from empire state building and 15 minutes from times Square!!! I will stay again in Hilton garden Inn on my next trip in NYC!! Thank you team for the amazing experience!!,1
Great location| quick check in. Friendly staff| free tea and coffee for guest at reception is great| especially in winter,1
Nice location- convenient to many areas- which is why we chose to stay here. Average hotel for the area. Staff was rude| particularly Jon Schorr| as well as the lady who checked us in at the front desk. Otherwise| decent stay.,1
enjoyed stay but beds was small,1
Great hotel that is located with in walking distance to everything and if you need to ride the subway it is right beside it. Quiet room and great customer service from the staff. Perfect for our weekend getaway.,1
Customer service was excellent; not happy about paying to hold kids bags a couple of hours on checkout day.  Restaurant there not kid friendly.,1
Room was very comfortable| clean | and quiet.  Great location!,1
Room was clean and well maintained.,1
Excellent location| nice staff| good breakfast. I will stay again.,1
Excellent location to most everything! Good sized guest room (for N.Y. standards). Convenient having a restaurant right next door.,1
We found some used bandages in the sheets of one of the beds when we first checked in. It felt very tight in the room. That said| the staff was great| helpful| professional| and friendly. The location was nice| not too far from the action. Very quiet neighborhood and hotel. We would stay there again.,1
Smiling| friendly| exceptionally helpful staff.  Clean| well-appointed room.  The fridge and microwave are helpful.  Good Keurig coffeemaker.  The heater unit made a series of small clicking noises after shutting off| as well as the fire sensor flashing occasional lights.  Floor 7| street side is very quiet.  Room with king bed is quite spacious.  Doesn't have a bath| but a large walk-in shower.  Overall very roomy bathroom.  Room with two double beds is very tight quarters for a family of four.  You have to manually turn TVs on/off| but remote works for everything else.  Any trouble we had was insignificant enough not to have complained.  We really enjoyed the location| walkability to Macy's| Korea Town| main artery of 34th street and half-block to 6 train.,1
This hotel is in a great location and the staff is very nice. The elevators are a bit slow - plan accordingly when checking out| etc.,1
Perfect location with excellent staff.,1
The bedroom was really good| the bed was a king size and its great for 2 adults and one infant.,1
Nice hotel close to major shopping areas| Empire State Building (which was right out our window)| Macy's parade route within 3 blocks and a subway station!  Everyone on staff wanted our stay to be the very best it could possibly be! Clean| caring and close! The motto for this hotel!,1
Very friendly staff.  Good location close to Macy's and other shopping.,1
Nice hotel| exceptional location.  Excellent service| functional hotel without being extravagant.,1
Very friendly staff. Always willing to help. Gave us directions to nearby restaurants and shops.,1
We had just came in from a 16 hr flight from China so needless to say we where tired....the lady at tbe front desk| i dont remember her name| but she sounds like she is from Jamaica.....she took great care of us.The cookies where out of this world.,1
It was great experience.  Staff went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and then some!,1
The location was very good.  We were placed on the 6th floor| 4 floors above the open air bar the evening of the McGreggor fight.  The bar was very loud until around 12:30 AM or so.  Hilton needs to determine which must be sacrificed| the bar| or the rooms that face the bar.  I am an architect and have never seen anything quite like this.  We arrived at the hotel at 3:10| but our reservation for a two-bed room could not be accommodated without a 40 min delay as they readied a room.   The problem was our son was being married in Brooklyn (a 4:30 PM wedding)... a small affair| but that delay| and a major accident on the highway coming to NYC| made us 10 minutes late for the wedding.  We had called in advance to advise them of the critical nature of the timing| but it was lost on the staff. That being said| the desk attendant did all she could to try to make this bad experience right| gave us free breakfast| but ultimately we were late for the wedding and| upon return| were up until around 1:00 AM| or so| because of the noisy lounge.  Although she was great| a male manager (her superior) looked on totally indifferent to our plight| shrugged his shoulders and said they will need to wait for the room.  We needed the room in order for my wife and daughter to freshen-up before the wedding. Even though the accident-caused traffic delay was not their fault| had the room been ready when we arrived| we would have made the wedding with one-half hour to spare.,0
The hotel was fine and in a great location. However| the room was small and both the rug and the bed spread had stains on them which was disheartening. The air conditioner worked well| shower was great| bed and sheets were comfy| and the complimentary coffee in the lobby in the morning was delicious.  I wish there had been at least 2 complimentary water bottles in the room.,1
The a/c unit acted up a bit| and it was difficult to keep the room at a comfortable level.  Also| the elevators were noisy at night (our room was adjacent to the elevator bank),1
nice hotel. excellent location. just a few minutes walking from the empire state building. the only problem was the air conditioner made noise at night,1
Pleasant stay. Small room| but all was fine. Very attentive staff.,1
It was a great location with many restaurants to eat within walking distance. Service was great and the cookies| cold water and cold tea at the lobby was a great detail.,1
Kudos to the friendly and helpful staff and management at this Garden Inn.  My room was super clean| spacious| and had a lovely view of the city. The front desk and manager were very accommodating when I had to make a last minute change to my length of stay due to Hurricane Florence. I will definitely stay here again when I return and would highly recommend to anyone wanting a hotel with great staff| service| and a fantastic location.,1
Good hotel| clean room| good location,1
It was my first time in Manhattan| NY. I liked how it had a restaurant/Bar attached to the hotel (Aintsworth) my Girlfriend has an allergy to feathers and when she told the front desk she needed an alternative option they switched it out promptly. Rooms were a little small but whatever. I would stay again. Close to the subway. Check in was fast and smooth. Great first time experience.,1
Great air conditioning.  Nice gym.  A senior could use it.,1
Great location|  everything great !Close to metro| to restaurants|  walking distance to broadway to central park| to time square.,1
Great location| good stuff and nice facilities.. drawback: forgot to do the room... you have to buy umbrellas from them,1
Nice hotel| convenient. Clean and comfortable. Complimentary Coffee was delicious.,1
Thank you! We had a great time in the Big Apple!  Bed was comfy| but not the pillows,1
I complained about the room being freezing the first day.  I was offed to move to a different room but was informed that all the rooms had the same issue.   I did not sleep well due to the cold. I was told that they were unable to shut off the air.  When I came back from a long day's work| upon opening the door| I found dirty towels strewn in in front of the main door| coffee not replaced| used coffee items put back as if unused. When I said I wanted to find a new hotel| I had to move at 11:45 in the evening and fight to have this awful stay comped only to find out from expedia that it was denied and they charged me for the first night| after the manager went into the computer and then told me I did not owe anything.,0
Closeness to trains excellent customer service. Rooms were clean and comfortable,1
It was wonderful!,1
Excellent staff| good comfortable room| but expensive breakfast.,1
The beds were very uncomfortable. The staff at check in were very nice.,1
Stayed here several times recently but this time the room had a faulty AC.  Would only cool to 74 or 75 then start expelling warm air.....room would get to 79 or 80 I would wake up and reset and the process would start allover again,0
Comfort stay with great location & reasonable price. Slightly too long queue waiting for an elevator.,1
Close to visitors attractions and public transportation,1
I was very happy with my stay here. My room was clean and seemed newly renovated. The staff was very nice. I'll definitely be back if I need to stay in this neighborhood again.,1
Our stay was ok. Room was very small but clean & comfortable. I found the front desk staff quite nonchalant. Location is very good,1
Nice hotel centrally located in mid town. Close to shops and restaurants. Very close to Empire State Building and a 20 minute walk to Times Square. Subway is right at the corner. Complimentary water| iced tea| coffee and cookies in the lobby. Clean facility and friendly staff. Would stay here again.,1
This hotel works extremely well for us and we try to stay here whenever we're in the city. Rooms are clean and comfortable and proximity to the 6 train makes getting around easy. Staff always welcoming and friendly.,1
The air conditioner did not get the room cold and kept shutting off. When is started back up it made a really loud clicking sound that jolted me awake every time. It was a TERRIBLE night of sleep. Other than that| everything was great.,0
Weekend stay for sightseeing. Easy walk to Empire State building and right at 6 train. Clean and new room| nice fixtures in bathroom. Ended up walking to/from Penn Station--bit of a hike| seemed too close to take a cab but there isn't an easy subway route. A block away from a decent diner. Friendly and helpful staff. But: I understand it's tradition not to have floor #13| but this hotel had no floor #4| #14| or #24 either. Puzzling.,1
Hotel was great| very well maintained| nice ice tea daily| not too bad coffee. We didn't like the noisy restaurant| and the poor sound room insulation in street facing room (for those of us that are sound sensitive). We stayed for 6 nights| good location| if possible stay on higher floors.,1
It  was fine. Proximity to everything. On my next visit to NYC| i'll seek accommodations here.,1
Rooms smell like dirty socks| ongoing construction,0
Would definetly recommend booking this hotel! After a long day of walking and sightseeing all you want to do is get to the hotel and take a nice shower and good rest. Everything is so clean and the staff is great! Plus| the metro stop is across the street.,1
first time in the big apple| this hotel was in a perfect location to explore. right next to the subway| walking distance to Madison sq garden| and time square. rooms were clean| and updated. Also had a great restaurant and bar attached. close to food and everything needed. Will definitely stay here again.,1
The location is great and close to all major points for meetings. It was great coming into the room and finding it comfortable| clean and it feels new. It's small| but it's perfect. The shower is great after a long day of travel and meetings. It was also less of a worry knowing thing had breakfast as of 6am. This way I didn't have to look for a place to eat could come back to my hotel room to work a bit before heading out. This is definitely where I'm staying for future trips.,1
This hotel was in a nice location.  Close to various restaurants and the subway.,1
Nice clean| spacious rooms.  Pleasant staff and informative| would stay again,1
Clean hotel with nicely appointed lobby. Room was clean and consistently kept each day of our stay.,1
This Hilton Garden Inn was located in midtown| two blocks from the Empire State Building and within walking distance of Macy's and Times Square.  The hotel was nice| but the room was very small.  We appreciated that the room was ready when we arrived quite early in the afternoon.  I was surprised that there was so little noise from the street.  My biggest complaint was the charge for parking.  I believe a rate of $65 a day was quoted.  When we checked in| we were charged $80 per day since the vehicle was ‚Äúoversized.‚Äù  It is a Honda Accord!!  I felt this was a poor business practice| since once you have paid for your room and arrived at the hotel| what are your other parking options?,1
Great hotel. Very clean and quiet on 9th floor.Small room but very comfortable. Great A/C! Good location for NYC. Nice restaurant & bar downstairs,1
The staff was great and the room was clean. When I booked the room| the booking denoted it was a suite but there is no way that room was a suite because it was very small.,1
Nice hotel. Good touch w the drink happy hour of waters and tea w cookies.,1
Hotel room was clean| shower water pressure was great and so was the room heater.   The negatives are the double beds are more like twin beds and the closet is extremely small even for NY standards. We enjoyed the lemon water they provided in the evening along with some type of tea we didn't taste. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful.,1
Check in was super easy| room was very clean and comfortable....great mid town location...i will definitely stay there again...,1
 Grand central,1
Great business hotel in a very convenient location.,1
I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a comfortable stay at a decent price.,1
Very good value for the location we needed.  Clean rooms| friendly staff.,1
Very solid NYC hotel. Staff was notably warm and friendly.,1
Our trip was fantastic| the hotel was in a perfect spot and was very clean.,1
We stayed over the weekend and from the minute we walked in the experience was amazing. Very convenient location| access to subway around the corner. Walking distance to all the main sites in Manhattan. Will be staying there again. Thank you.,1
Our room was in perfect order. The bed was so very comfortable for me and my wife. The television worked fine. The bathroom and the shower within it was beautiful and immaculate. I look forward to staying there as one of my son's lives on Park Avenue 2 blocks away and we prefer to stay overnight at a hotel| your hotel. In the recent past we stayed at the 206 East 52rd street Hilton Garden Inn| a block from MSKH chemotherapy center on 53rd street| and we loved the Hilton Inn each of the 5 times we were there overnight..,1
Great location. Empire State Building 3 blocksaway. Subway stop at corner. Plenty of places to eat,1
Always appreciate the good coffee| comfortable beds| and updated rooms,1
Great location! Close to Metro.,1
We traveled with another family on a mother and son trip| and the hotel was conveniently located to all landmarks| Empire State Building only 0.3 miles away!  There is a restaurant located inside the hotel as well as a quaint coffee shop across the street that was amazing! The staff was so amazing! They helped us with all the questions we had and were eager to help!  The rooms were very comfortable and clean. We will definitely be returning!  Thanks for a trip we will never forget!,1
Staff was very friendly & helpful. The room was small but comfortable bed & pillows.,1
The hotel is centrally located so that it is easy to walk to many attractions. The staff were great.,1
Great hotel in a brilliant location. Subway station is just around the corner,1
First| I was placed in an adjoining room where I could hear everything next door with the baby crying.  I explained this to the front desk and was quickly relocated to another room.  Thank you to Moe who was very helpful.,1
Execellent stay! was only for one night but it was comfortable| easy & convienent. Would Recommend,1
There was a station with coffee and tea in the morning and iced tea and lemon flavored water in the afternoon/evening| however the stations were often empty of the things I was looking for: Hot water| green tea| or the lemon water.,1
We stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn as it was near NYU School of Medicine| where our son was interviewing.  Rooms were not very large| but were comfortable and had lots of towels and sundries.  The rooms were quiet and we got a good night sleep.  Very nice pillows!,1
Hotel staff was incredibly friendly and helpful! Nice coffee shop conveniently located across the street and steps away from the subway and Empire State Building.,1
Room was nice| but there is a subway underneath so you can hear a train going by constantly. Try to request a room high up,1
Good! Room is clean and quiet.,1
Convenient location. I'm staying the same hotel in San Francisco and they will offer free bottle water. But in New York| they don't have any water or kettle provided.,1
It was a nice stay. The staff was nice. We were disturbed the 2nd night because of another guest who smoked in the bathroom (no smoking hotel!) and the firefighters showing at 1-2 am. We didn't really sleep after that. The hotel paid our parking for the stay.,1
location is pretty central and close to the lively heart of Manhattan. Hotel is nice. Rooms are not very big but neat and clean. Unfortunately we did not have breakfast included in our fare.,1
The hotel is perfectly located. In front of the hotel you can park your car free of charge over the weekend (starting on Friday at 6pm). What I also did. But I do not understand why the hotel staff was sending me to a park house for ... 56 USD / day ! The room is not big. It was enough for me| but I expected something a bit bigger. I am Hilton Honors member and the hotel did not recognize my membership because I booked through hotels.com...,1
Perfect !!!!!!,1
This hotel was dirty and very outdated and the air conditioning hardly worked. For the price you pay you could get much more. Our first room had throw up on the floor that didn't even look like was attempted to be cleaned| luckily we were able to get a new room when we complained about it| the front desk staff didn't even seem surprised.,0
Rooms were a bit smaller than I thought| blankets were a bit outdated but overall it was a good stay,1
Very conveniently located closer to airport and to LMU. Friendly staff,1
Great location and facility is clean and safe.,1
Cacey at the reception was awesome! Rooms were small but clean. Which that the hotel bar could have been open. Overall excellent!,1
It is located in a really nice area. Very accessible.,1
I didn't like the fact that my room was right next to the house keeping closet. I heard them gathering their items throughout the day.,1
Location| beautiful room and cleanliness,1
The location was perfect for walking| subway and bus use.  The desk workers were very helpful!,1
The unique thing that I don't like Is the room deposit that in the information say no deposit in the check in and we think that was true. For or lucky we have money extra but I dont know if we don't what'll happend in that case. Everything else was super!,1
It was very close to the metro station. Big rooms.,1
Small room & trash everywhere,0
It clearly states in the description that they offer valet peeking service which they do not.,1
Like the size of beds| and room. The view from my room floor 26. Quiet zone.One of the elevator was out of service so was uncomfortable to wait a lot for the elevator. Twice we used the stairs.,1
stayed for almost 2 weeks. The staff are so great especially the manager Rani. will stay again in the future. the only down side is one elevator working during my stay .,1
Great location| comfortable beds and nice shower pressure...great customer service from Managers on Duty!!,1
Stayed there over July 4th weekend. Very busy. Elevator was broken leaving only one in use. Waited 1/2 hour for elevator and check out line was a nightmare. Between broken elevator and long checkout line it took an hour to check out. Also there are only a couple luggage carts to bring your things downstairs. Need more carts.,1
Our experience was extremely disappointing. Elevators went out f service then only 1 was restored to service. The car was extremely slow and extremely small. Climate control in the room was inadequate. The staff was inattentive and gruff. The room was poorly laid out  We will not be booking this location,0
As is often the case in Manhattan| check in is a bit stressful. You have to park kind of illegally near the hotel entrance and quickly run inside to check in. The parking is not very close and is on a different street. The first place I went to was not the right one but the nice attendant seemed used to people making the same mistake. The right one was about 100 yards (or meters) further. The GPS becomes less reliable among the tall buildings. Eventually ot worked out fine.No in and out privileges but a car can be more of a hassle in Manhattan.The staff took care of our few needs.One of two elevators broke. Another classic big city occurrence but other than few extra minutes of waiting| it was not too bad. I think the hotel| just like the rest of NYC| was significantly less crowded than prepandemic still.The breakfast was not the usual continental buffet. It was a nice change and quite pleasant. We had booked the room with breakfast included which probably was a good move.,1
They let me check in at 9 a.m.!!!! They're located in a really safe area| less than a block away from a really nice Subway station| which is definitely uncommon. There's always someone available to help and there's a sushi restaurante open until 2 a.m. right next door. Can't get a better hotel in Manhattan| honestly.,1
I love everything except for the room. We booked a premium room with city views. The views were ok but the room is small. There's 3 people and we can barely walk in the room. Come here with small suitcases or else nothing will fit. But I love how clean and attentive the staff are. The area is safe. There's a Japanese restaurant next which is a plus.,1
Room are cleans,1
Very clean| great service and good location! Highly recommend and will stay there again.,1
I love the area where this hotel is located. It is super convenient to the subway| easy to get across town| and lots of dining options within walking distance. I also feel very safe in this neighborhood. A very cold room is very important to me and this one did not disappoint! The shower had great water pressure. The bed was very comfortable and the room was very clean. The only downside was the location of my room. It was on the 2nd floor over the hotel entrance. The view was not good| but to be fair to the hotel...I was a late arrival| I did not request a high floor and I did not complain about it at the property. I travel to NYC frequently| so the view was not that important to me. I would definitely recommend this property!,1
As all New York hotel rooms are small| it was clean | comfy enough space for 2 and 4 bags| very close to fifth avenue| around the block  a parking underground  ICON for 24 hours for $45 and some for $60| park on the street for free BUT move the car before 7 am!,1
The staff was friendly and helpful| the room clean and comfortable. With daily service in rooms suspended| the hotel provides no way to dispose of trash. Everyone takes their trash down to the lobby| kind of disgusting,1
No room cleaning unless requested due to Covid. I appreciated this because it was my first hotel stay since the outbreak and didn't want anyone entering my room.  Staff was super helpful and added little touches such as remembering and greeting me by name.  Will stay there again next time in nyc considering all the Airbnbs seem to have disappeared in nyc. Convenient location to launc both up and downtown.  Took Covid precautions seriously and no noise,1
Couldn't find my reservation I made a month out | So I was charged a different rate than what my reservation stated . I even gave reservations number showed the gentleman at the front desk and he still charged my card a higher rate. So I'm not happy with Hilton or Hotels.com. Have to use other companies,0
Donny| at the front desk was friendly and helpful. he helped make my stay very enjoyable,1
I chose this location as it lists having Valet Parking. This is not accurate. The hotel no longer offers valet parking. You can unload outside the hotel and check in| receive a voucher to park your car 5-5 blocks away.,1
Good location| we needed to be close to a hospital. Rony in the front desk was very helpful and kind.,1
Great stay,1
Poor maintenance| room was not cleaned in a dailly basis|Trash i the room was not pickup daily.  I pay for a supposed breakfast buffet| but it was a single plate serving| anything extra was not covered.  Prices at the local store were very high compare to other stores in the neighborhood,0
Location is far from everything. For a Hilton hotel I expected more it was old fashioned with tiny rooms. Housekeeping also took a pair of gucci socks from my bed and ‚Äúlost them‚Äù. Ronny the manager finally got back to me 8 days later and was rude on the phone. Definitely will not be coming back here ever.,0
Awesome located just blocks away from Times Square 5th ave in love üíúüíúüíú,1
Very clean| great staff and  customer service,1
Our stay was great.  The room was exceptionally clean and the front desk service was great.,1
The worst hotel that I stayed in since I've been a member hotel.com,0
I have been here several times before.  It is now my first choice in NYC,1
The stuff location view service the very best!!It is a lucky hotelBrings you  a good luckThe best hilton in nycEnjoy ur stayOh mattress pillows ectrimily comfortable.To all the stuffThank you for ur kindness help.,1
Pleasant stay. Sizable space for rooms. Enjoyed the ample desk space to work. Overall good experience. Front desk was helpful and the staff was on top of things.,1
Great service very clean BUT my room bed was not to sturdy definitely needed a new mattress,1
We have stayed at many hotels in the city in the last few years and this Hilton is one of the cleanest| well maintained and organized Hiltons. This is our preferred hotel when we need to stay in New York city.,1
Clean| safe and walking distance to many attractions. I am a native to NYC and visit often. I am impressed by this hotel. I highly recommend. Has cheap/close parking| walking distance to Rockefeller Center/Nintendo/American Girl/LEGO/etc.| an AMAZING Paris Bakery| Starbucks and restaurants/bars. Hotel is quite| staff is polite| helpful| Covid-Compliant and will go above and beyond to make sure your stay is a happy one. A truly top notch hotel.,1
Clean |and very friendly staff . Good location |walking distance to shopping and local landmarks .,1
It was a very pleasant stay..the only tough thing is the parking which is a bit of a walk.  Might be helpful to add valet parking option to your guests. Overall we were happy with the stay.,1
Staff were polite and welcoming. Room was clean which was one of my biggest concerns,1
The front desk staff couldn't have been,1
Stayed for a few hours sleep and a shower in-between shifts,1
Great location| walking distance to most attractions as well as eateries. Only issue I had was the shower didn't drain properly but I didn't want to change rooms or have anyone inside to fix it.,1
It was a great experience I will definitely stay over again. Customer service was great  and nice location. What made it even better is that we had a balcony to ourselves.,1
The staff was very pleasant and helpful. Lisbeth and the 2 gentlemen. Sorry I don't remember either of their names. My daughter loss her first child and she was New York Presbyterian 68th and  York| This hotel was five minutes away. The hospital allowed on support because I drove her I was able to stay until her boyfriend arrived. I was able to sit in the hotel and watch her give birth on FaceTime and cheer her on despite she would not be able to bring her daughter Hasina home. I explained to the staff as they inquired our stay. They offered up condolences and sentiments. Thank you üôè,1
The woman at the front desk was great. Very helpful and super friendly.,1
We could hear the people in the room next to us. The walls are paper thin. The shower door would not close properly so water ran all over the floor| toilet paper arm was hanging off the wall| space was tight| elevators were slow.,0
The staff at this hotel were amazing. Friendly and helpful for us out-of-towners that were a little overwhelmed by the city. We weren't able to check in early but they stored our bags and we were off to explore. The room was clean but super small. I would definitely stay here again!,1
Nice clean rooms| reasonably priced| lovely staff - overall we really enjoyed our stay. Only downside is the elevators| they can be quite slow. But if you don't mind waiting an extra few minutes it's quite fine.,1
Very comfortable stay.  The only hiccup was that no one cleaned my room despite telling the front desk twice.  I received a breakfast voucher instead. Otherwise I would stay here again.  Hilton Garden Inn also doesn't charge facilities fees like other NYC hotels do...,1
Very friendly| accommodating staff| clean room!,1
Small room| but it's a perfect location. Easy access to everywhere and it's right by the train station.,1
Everything is good| except that the day we would be leaving| a staff knocked at our door to ask what time we would be leaving which is a quite rude.,1
Room was nice and enjoyed the stay. However| after I checked out| I was charged for a breakfast I did not eat. I called and they did not believe me despite the signature on the receipt not matching my signature. We did not eat in the restaurant during our stay. It took multiple phone calls to get resolved. Totally unacceptable to not disclose these charges at checkout or to not believe me when I initially called. Zandra from billing was very unprofessional during the phone call and was more accusatory than apologetic.,0
excellent location. good staffs. fine restaurants are nearby. clean and well managed. only problem was noise from the neighboring room.,1
Super loud| you can hear your neighbors behind the wall and the elevator running up and down. TV would turn off every 5 min or so.,0
The room was excellent - nicely renovated and very clean and excellent housekeeping staff.,1
Proximity to interesting section of 2nd Ave. Efficient| clean| friendly.,1
Excellent!! Clean!!! Close to everything!!!,1
the Hilton Garden Inn was close to so many sites | so we walked everywhere . We took a Via car from Laguardia for a good deal . Staff at the hotel were friendly . The room was smallish | but clean and comfortable | and we didn't spend much time there anyway .,1
Great location with proximity to many places of interest| Whole Foods| parking.,1
Really love the location. Front desk staff very friendly!!,1
My reservation was moved from a Hilton Garden to a Holiday Inn Express ... which is a huge down grade as far as I am concerned.  I was never contacted prior to my arrival at Hilton Garden and after walking 2 miles to get there| we had to walk again to another hotel.  The Holiday Inn Express is not as nice as a Hilton Garden Inn.  I am a Hilton Honors member and lost earning points by being moved.,0
Nice place close to midtown..,1
Great stay with the family| had nice help from the front desk with our luggage. Rooms not as spacious to walk around in| but the whole area was clean and comfortable to rest in.,1
Toilet was running and the heat didn't adjust but then we saw the thermostat on the wall the next day. So our night was a little warm. The room had nice amenities and was pretty clean. Front desk personnel were excellent!,1
Great location. Very clean and staff was beyond great. Coffee service every morning a big plus.,1
Hilton Garden Inn was excellentBrilliant location| great service.Older style rooms but immaculately clean and perfectly fine,1
I loved the fact they had parking. Expensive and your not supposed to use your car the entire duration of your stay| however we got lucky and were able to use our car to travel to see the statue of liberty! Great trip! Wish we had more time there! Will definitely be going back in the near future!,1
This location is close to Central Park and the Subway Terminal.,1
friendly staff at receptionsometimes long wait for elevator,1
Clean rooms and quick check in. Located in a central location with cute bars.,1
The location is great. LOTS of great restaurants. Not far from St. Patrick's Cathedral and the Madison Ave. high fashion stores.,1
It had everything one needed|  neatly packed within a room.,1
A parcel was left at reception by a relative. When I asked at checkout I was told no parcel was delivered. As delivery was confirmed by my relative some 30 minutes earlier| this just points to total incompetence by desk staff.,1
Clean and neat and inviting. Staff was VERY friendly,1
Modern| clean and good mid-town location. Rooms good size. Breakfast decent| with excellent service in contrast  to reception.,1
Everything was great| only fault was noise from city came in through windows.,1
Excellent customer service and CLEAN which is very important to me - only thing that was bad was there was only 2 elevators and guests and staff had to wait forever to use them - but other than that it was a great stay!,1
The bed design is terrible!  Base sticks out further than matters and kept hitting it with shin.  Bathroom door swings out and is awkward getting shower ready.,1
The hotel rooms are very comfortable and the location in midtown East is great. Staff very accommodating. Breakfast is standard mid-level hotel fare at $15 for a continental and $22 for a full breakfast.,1
Pros: Hotel is modern and very clean with good-sized rooms. Location is great for Grand Central| UN| midtown offices. Cons: Wardrobe is smaller than a regular closet. Hallway design puts door close to each other| and when a neighbor's door opens/closes during the night it sounds like your own door is being opened. Elevators are fast but there are only two servicing 20+ floors‚Äîand one was shut off every night of my stay| so guests would have to line up and wait in the lobby to get to their rooms for 2-5 minutes at 11PM or 1AM.,1
Great location| the staff is super friendly| have stayed here many times and would stay again and again,1
We enjoyed the fact that it was very close to the attractions of NYC.- Times Square| Rockefeller Center| Empire State Building| Chrysler Building| Macy's| Central Park| etc. Located on a quiet street and reasonably priced.  Would return.,1
We were greeted by the best front desk person with a great personality. Unfortunately| I cannot remember her name. She demonstrated the BEST costumer service I have experienced!,1
Great little upper east side hotel. Would definitely recommend,1
Infused water available in the lobby. Umbrellas available to borrow,1
Location was ideal. We were within walking distance to all the places we needed to be!,1
Everyone was so helpful and thoughtful.   I would come back to this hotel my next visit to nyc.   Perfect location.,1
Location is superb| which is why I chose it (short walk to Bloomingdale's| Fifth Ave).  Two minor problems| elevators are so slow and shower did not have enough power| despite being on 4th floor,1
Great hotel with friendly| helpful staff.  Everything was clean and neat.  They did an excellent job of servicing our room each day.  I'll definitely plan to stay here again.,1
Very nice staff and good location. Comfortable rooms and quiet.,1
I wish that the faucet for the bathroom sink wasn't so hard to turn on and off.  It was like the faucet handle was stuck or something.  Other than everything was fantastic.,1
Clean decent size rooms for city nice bar only issueRoom in front and fairly loud street noise at night,1
Great staff. Easy check in. Great location walking distance to Central Park,1
Very noisy as walls so thin,0
LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION! Convenient to anywhere of Manhattan.,1
Jacqueline was amazing!!! She made my stay!,1
The location is excellent and I love the coffee in the AM and the ice water in the afternoons.,1
Double rooms with comfy QUEEN beds which is a huge plus!  All staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was excellent. Decent location in east midtown| very walkable to many spots. Will stay again!,1
Completely fraudulent and deceptive pictures and room size descriptions on line. This is NOT a normal HGI room - it is like sleeping in a closet you can barely walk in if you have a suitcase. Staff is unfriendly and hostile if you complain about getting a decent size room.,0
Amazing time in New York. Great location,1
Loved the hotel and restaurant| very convenient to Sloan Kettering Hospital. The beds were so comfortable and the room was amazing! We were on the top floor (28) with a beautiful city view. From check in to check out this hotel was great. We booked last minute the morning of our trip| with a wonderful hotels.com member rate.,1
Everyone was so nice and accommodating.  Even the housekeepers were so sweet| gave me a water bottle because it was so hot on my way to check out.,1
Loved this place. We walked to most attractions from the hotel.,1
It was a little dated but very comfortable.  Bed was comfy and hotel was clean,1
I'd like the place is in the middle of everything | a one block is the metro station # 6 which connected with any metro in the area and down there was a mini shopping centerEvery morning we had coffee and chocolate and after that cold water whit fruit anytime of the day| everything was set in the Lobby|  very convenient .,1
We really enjoyed the location in midtown east.  Walkable to so much and subway access a few blocks away! It was clean and neat. Always a friendly staff willing to give us ideas/suggestions anytime we asked.,1
Ice machine broken. We called down for ice multiple times| but they never actually came up. Tv also didnt work,0
Great location! Close to everything| especially the subway.,1
The staff was very nice and pleased| ready to help and almost all of them were perfect fit for the job. It just had one very rude old lady on the front desk that didn't care about treating us nice| she speaks Spanish| I don't remember her name| besides that| we had no problems.,1
It was noisy outside due to construction and traffic.   Woke up few times at night.  Other than that| it was a good place.,1
What can I say other than it was wonderful. We got there early and where given an early check-in at no extra charge. The people where friendly no matter the time of day. And I must say those where some of the fastest elevators we've ever been in. The ice machine on our floor was not working but there was a sign posted with the location of the next available one. All in all 5stars. We can't wait to visit again. Thank u,1
Downtown but not right in the centre of things. Easy access to everything via subway. Lots of restaurants near by.,1
Jackie | who checked us in| went out of way on our behalf.  She never forgot our names the enire 3 da ys we were there.  The staff overall was excellent.,1
breakfast cooked food was so so and i regretted ordering and paying extra for the hot food items,1
Liked having coffee/tea or water in the lobby.  Staff pleasant.  Great location.,1
Very close restaurants and not too crowded as the Times Sqare area.,1
$100 for early check in| $10 for package handling. That's on top of the $380 room rate. Do yourself a favor and stay elsewhere.,0
Great location| helpful friendly staff and nice restaurant,1
The restaurant served food that was exceptionally good. This was unexpected. The staff was nice and very helpful,1
Its near the train station one minute walk| near one of the best Bagel ESSA Bagel / Panda Express/ CVS Pharmacy. Staff is customer oriented. We have few demands And so nice to give it to us. Is a small hotel so definitely all you needs will be attended.  And the place is near the police station so it is very very safe.,1
The beds were very comfortable and the shower was great! I wish the restaurant would have stayed open later.,1
Easy check in!  Nice property.  Admittedly| a little far from major tourist spots with 3 small kids in tow.,1
Price and proximity to all main sites in midtown/manhattan. Great restaurant..great waitresses. Lobby is beautiful. Fire place to stay warm. Rooms had everything we needed. And beds were sooo comfortable.,1
Nice place! Smaller than expected but we had a great stay!,1
Bathrooms not properly cleaned| carpets are old and dated.,1
I liked the location| but didn't like that the elevator was right off of my room and had to listen to it all night.  I suspect this is the case for many of their rooms due to how the hotel was constructed.,1
Reserved a double Queen and they said it was not guaranteed and they would normally have to charge me extra.   They ended up not charging extra.  Frustrating to even have to discuss it when on expedia the option chosen was double queen.,0
Nice to have two queen beds in Manhattan for me and my family sharing one room!,1
Staff was so friendly and very helpful with information about New York.oue son was in the solan letting hospital and the staff was great at changing our rooms at time thank you,1
The room was very comfortable. They didn't have included breakfast,1
Gorgeous| fully equipped rooms. No detail left unimagined. Great value for money.,1
Excellent option for people that would not spend much time in the room.,1
The rooms were clean| sleek and felt luxurious.  The staff were incredibly friendly| helpful and response!  I will definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone| especially with the great price we booked through Expedia.,1
Good place good service,1
Ms. Jacqueline was AMAZING! All of the staff was friendly and spoke anytime they saw a guest. They were on top of clean new towels and sheets and even gave extras. It was one of the best stays I've ever had in a hotel and I travel a good amount a year!,1
Was very impressed with the customer service. Had an issue with the microwave in our room and they immediately came and took care of it. Front desk employees were accommodating| helpful and friendly. We had no complaints at all. Thank you,1
Very convienent location for us. Clean room| friendly staff and a restaurant on site made this a pleasant stay.,1
The staff was very friendly. Room was nice and comfortable with enough amenities to make staying comfortable,1
I had to move to another room because there was no tub in my original room. Not happy i had to pay more for another room,0
Great hotel with all amenities except full biz center. Well trained friendly staff with few exceptions.,1
Bed was nasty with hair and bottle waters $3.00 and bathroom no heat very cold,0
The key room never worked we coudn't leave the hotel cause each key we get dosn't work,0
Room was very clean| including the bathroom. Bed was clean and well made| if a little hard for my taste.  Pillows were plump and clean. Entire staff was friendly and helpful. Would stay there again.,1
Great location between 2 very useful subway stations.  Rooms are clean| comfortable| and large by NYC standards.  The afternoon cookies are a nice touch too.,1
This told me that my room was paid in full and then added an additional charge on my bill. I did not use any items that were in the room and no damage was done so i should not have had any additional charges. I called in about it and i was hung up on. I will not be reccommending this location.,0
Front desk people friendly and helpful. Always smiling and very attentive!,1
Very close to public transportation| full service restaurant downstairs plus a mini store for soft drinks and snacks. My room was clean| temperature control was great on a very cold NY evening| staff was professional.  I will definitely use this hotel again.,1
It.  Was.  Beautiful. Customer. Service  was. Great. And. Quite   rested. Real. Good,1
Great location and great value. Great amenities too.,1
"We found exactly what we were looking for for a four-night stay in Manhattan| one adult with two teenagers. The two-queen room was sufficient in size| the mini-fridge and microwave a plus for a quick breakfast ""in"". The beds were comfortable. The bathroom was good and well-maintained. And it was amazingly quiet at night. The only thing to keep in mind is that there are only two elevators for this smallish hotel with 28 floors| so there can be a wait during ""rush hours"".",1
After a nice night out| came into a friendly staff that got me check-in to my room. The room was clean and the beds where actually nice. I actually check-in really late so the staff gave me a late check-out as well. Will come back to this hotel when i visit NY again,1
Great service and clean!,1
It was good under the location of midtown. If have a bathtab| will be much great!,1
Great location| easy check in. Quiet rooms and well located,1
Place was amazing I would strongly recommend staying here.  Quick walk tk everything;,1
You get what you pay for. Room was nice and location was ideal to the activities we planned to do. Staff were amazing and very helpful.,1
While the hotel did not have a grand lobby like other midtown eastside hotels| it did have free coffee and cookies daily and was very welcoming. The rooms were well appointed with Mini fridge| microwave and coffee maker.,1
Management was great,1
our room you can here all the noise outside day and night but the staff are very helpfull & housekeeping are great.,1
Small room but 2 queen beds are a plus! Good midtown location.,1
Everyone was great. The staff was very friendly and the room was clean.,1
We actually really enjoyed the room and cocktails down in the bar. But having only one operating elevator for 28 floors is unacceptable. It was such a long wait that we missed our train and the elevator my sister was on was awful due to a fight that ensued because of the delays. I wouldn't stay there again just because of that. I understand that things happen but they knew the day before that it was broken and it should have been addressed then.,0
Its a tiny hotel but overall it was nice| and its not as far as I though it will be.,1
Great location| very friendly staff. Very fast check in,1
Hotel staff was very helpful and courteous. Great place to stay.,1
Room was really clean| and everything was laid out well.  Desk was a good size| and good access to plugs.  Solid wifi connectivity.  Comfortable bed.  Bathroom was a good size.  And very friendly staff.  Everyone was so nice| from the front desk staff to everyone working the floors and rooms.,1
short walk to subway| beautiful view of skyscrapers| 16 th floor|? clean room.  nice pillows| hot water| I highly recommend this hotel.  approx $250 per night including tax,1
We would definitely stay again.  Very clean room and Friendystaff,1
We will stay again when we come up to visit family.,1
Nice hotel very close to subway| a lot of museums and shops and restaurants. Very clean and best of all| very quiet!! Didn't hear any neighbors or elevators while sleeping. Parking is a lot so we parked elsewhere.,1
Great location. Very accommodating and helpful. The guy in the lobby even hailed a cab for us. The only negative was $75 a night to park your car and $3 bottled water. The hotel was clean and safe. Free coffee| water and cookies in the lobby. I would definitely return.,1
Good overall experience. However| it would be nice if the hotel informed in advance that the 2 bottles of water during house keeping required additional charges. I wouldn't mind paying for the water but at least let the customer know what they are getting.,1
We had a great stay at the Hilton Garden Inn.  I was impressed with the friendliness of the staff and the cleanliness of the hotel.,1
Great hotel right by the subway and a 24 hour Duane Reade.,1
The room was nice but difficult to adjust the room temperature.,1
Great mid-town location. Really helpful and friendly staff.,1
Excellent staff! Very helpful and thoughtful. Excellent food! Dinner is out of this world! Very clean. Had a wonderful stay.,1
Hotel was clean and staff was very friendly.  Location was great close to Central Park| Rockefeller etc.,1
Clean rooms| lovely staff| relatively quiet location.,1
Staff lovely but room was tiny and a little noisy.  Good location and very clean,1
Nice hotel with excellent staff. Very accommodating!,1
This hotel was really quiet and room was of a decent size for being in NYC,1
Good size room| clean and nice| quiet location midtown.,1
Room sevice was on point| staff was very friendly. Room was small but that's common in Manhattan. Decent hair dryer. Great view. Love the local area| lot's of places to get food nearby. The valet even packed my luggage into my car for me while I was getting breakfast.,1
Everyone was very kind and welcoming,1
Great location - very quiet.  Rooms small. Breakfast much too expensive but overall a good choice,1
excellent location| all staff from front desk to cleaning and maintenance extremely friendly and courteous,1
Very helpful Terri. All the ladies at front desk are great!!!Wonderful experienceüòò,1
We enjoyed the proximity to a number of attractions| stores and restaurants. The staff and lobby were always welcoming!,1
Great location if you are a first time visitor to NYC.  Easy to get to all the major sites in Manhattan by walking or subway.  Staff was very helpful with subway directions.  If you are coming from LaGuardia| take a cab.  We took their recommended SuperShuttle to the hotel and a cab back to the airport.  The cab was much faster and about $10 cheaper.,1
"In all honesty| we thought we had booked the Hilton Garden 8th Ave.  We were distraught at the unfeeling clerk who told us it happens a thousand times every day| ""see ya 'round"".  Then my daughter discovered that the E train leads right from Time Square to the Hilton at 2nd/52nd.  This hotel was the best we've ever used in dozens of trips to New York.  Quiet| clean| spacious| convenient & 10 minute subway to theatre district.  We will never stay anywhere else.",1
Comfortable beds| nice view| great location. Super clean.,1
Hotel is under construction. No mention of it prior to check in. The road in front was under construction| loud noises inside and outside of building. Also elevators didn't work for a lot of the stay. Very disappointed in a Hilton quality hotel,0
The hotel was very clean and extremely well maintained. the location was also quite and safe. The staff were exceptionally  professional| friendly and considerate-they made our stay really worthwhile.,1
I loved everything about the hotel except the resturant| i thought the standards were not fit for a Hilton hotel. The service was not up to swatch. Otherwise i enjoyed my stay overall.,1
Great location | clean| good neighbourhood|  close to great food and lots to do. Only reason not 5 stars| no pool $65.00 for parking a day| and no free complimentary water.,1
Nice| clean rooms. Great service,1
Very nice hotel| room was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful.  Only complaint was the elevators were tough to get| especially during busy times.  However not that big a deal.,1
Cool place but if you take the bottle water they place in the room you will be charged for it lol. It's not free lol,1
Typical midtown Manhattan mid-level hotel.  Nothing special| nothing bad.  I did not take advantage of any of the amenities. Used the wi-fi| slept in the bed| showered and left the next morning.,1
Excellent location! Really comfy queen size beds (rare to find in NYC) and great pillows!  Nice staff! Clean!!!   Room was ready at NOON!,1
My daughter and her friends stayed here after Governor's Ball 2018,1
Chose this hotel specifically because of the queen beds. One review said they weren't queen; they are 60 inches wide so they are. Clean| comfortable beds| quiet| close to the Lex/53rd stop. Small rooms but that's what you get in Manhattan unless you spend big bucks. Had a city view which was very nice so I can't speak to the other views.,1
Hilton Garden Inn Midtown East is a no frills hotel| but it has the basics in  a superb centrally located midtown area at an affordable price.  The rooms are clean albeit small.  For the value conscious traveler| it is a good choice.,1
Needed a place to stay overnight and this place was located in a convienient place for us.,1
There were holes in the towels. Really disappointing considering I paid $500 to stay here to find that the towels were cheap| small and had holes in them.,1
We had a wonderful stay in April--despite the fact that it felt more like November!  The staff was very pleasant and accommodating.  We arrived in the city several hours before our room would be ready| but we were able to leave our luggage there while we began our sightseeing.  We were able to store them again after we checked out since we had most of the day to explore before our train would arrive.  The hotel is close enough to walk to Rockefeller Center and Times Square| but is away from the hubbub so is not too noisy.  The room was clean and comfortable for our family of 4.  Overall| it was a great place to stay and we will be back!,1
Front desk need some welcoming training....,0
Hotel is clean and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this spot. Good locale and nice little gym too.,1
Staff was friendly| rooms were neat| view was good| & security was tighter with keyed elevators.,1
THe staff was very nice and location of hotel very convenient.  Room was a little dated.,1
Our one night stay in a 2 Queen bed Room was quiet and cozy. The room was clean| but small. It had a mini fridge| microwave| and complimentary WiFi. The 2 elevators were small and slow getting people up and down. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful.,1
We had a great experience| location is great | 300 feet from closest underground | banks are close | dining is close | great hotel,1
Overnight birthday stay.  Stay was good| room was comfy and clean.,1
Clean room. Not far from Rockefeller center. Quiet at night.,1
Great location. Close to subway entrance. Always felt welcome.  When one elevator was not working for a couple of days| the manager personally made it up to us. Great shower with good water pressure and hot water. Comfy bed. Clean room.,1
Nice| well-equipped room with comfortable bed and clean bathroom. Had King size bed| fridge micro and Keurig. Too small to have a sitting area if that's important to you. I was very pleasantly surprised given the low winter weekend rate.,1
Clean| wonderful pillows and very nice staff at front desk.,1
One elevator was down and they have only two. Imagine the chaos! But everything else was good.,1
I did not use the restaurant but I heard it was good.  Worth a try next time I visit New York City.,1
No return in time,0
Great... The stay has been nothing short of amazing. I would recommend the hotel to my friends and family,1
Everything was great. Location is good too. I just want to point out that the bottle water in the room is free for certain members so be aware of it before drinking it.,1
The hotel is in an excellent location. Some of the staff are very helpful and courteous. A couple of the staff at the desk act as if they don't see you. But the other staff members and maintenance workers are nice. There are restaurants in the immediate area; some pricey but you do have places in which to go if not interested in going to restaurant on premises. We had a hard time closing the bathroom door; had to force closure because floor was warped and door couldn't get over warped area. The bathroom shower would back up each time you took a shower; drain did not properly work so a little pond would form in shower.  I did give them a list of things wrong before I left. I hope they fix them. Also the refrigerator needed to be defrosted.We're so anxious to get out we're accepting anything. Let's get our money's worth.  The business have raised their prices Let's not lower our standards.,1
I didn't like that Expedia failed to alert the hotel of my change of itinerary. I await the refund that is owed me. Afterword: received my full refund to cover any errors made. And Expedia needs to get over the fact that I mentioned their error here. I will not otherwise alter this review.,0
Good location.,1
Good location for the budget. Clean and safe.,1
By far the worst customer service ever!! Never ever gotten that poor customer service! When we arrived we were given a room that was covered in hair everywhere restrooms| beds just plain nasty when I went downstairs to inform the front desk (with pictures) I was told that the was the only room with 2 beds available for the weekend and ended having to pay for a separate room just to accommodate my family üò°üò°üò°!!,0
liked location| and room sizeToo much wait for elevators| weak annoying internet connection| not enough towels changes,1
This hotel is very nice located between Times Square and Central Park. The rooms were spacious for NYC and had a nice shower. Convenient to MTA metro line E that brings you to JFK or La Guardia Airport.,1
WELL they have 3 tiny elevators for the whole hotel‚Ä¶. Only 1 of which worked. So it was not uncommon to have to wait 10/15minutes for an elevator - Often times when it finally came it was already full so you had to wait ANOTHER 10/15minutes. My boyfriend ended up routinely taking the stairs up and down‚Ä¶ we were on the 22nd floor. The front desk staff is extremely understaffed. No one ever answers when I called from the in room. Made several requests for towels and never got any. Every time I needed to go to the front desk it was an extremely long wait even if there weren't many people waiting in line. The rooms were nice though and clean| but everything else is a hot mess and really frustrating to the point where I wouldn't stay here again‚Ä¶. If not for the elevator situation alone. What you get For the money you pay for these rooms isn't worth it. I'd be willing to pay more money to stay in the same area but at a different hotel. And I'm pretty easy going.,0
Convenient to walk to other places great location clean outside environment,1
Our stay at the Hilton Garden Inn was fantastic. The room was just right. The air conditioning was cold| shower was roomy and great pressure| and refrigerator was perfect for our snacks. The location was exactly what we wanted| close to everything. Would stay here again!,1
Good location. However| one of the elevators was not working all the time causing unnecessary delays during rush hours. Many gusts do not wear masks despite the spike up in delta variant cases of Covid 19.,1
We reserved two rooms. My wife could not use room key| two consecutive days. There was no clear explanation why this happened and luck of professional hospitality.,0
The front desk staff dont answer the phone when you call with a question or request.  The tv in our room didnt work| so we called down for help‚Ä¶multiple times| no answer.  Finally my husband went down to the front desk where he was ignored while waiting for the front desk person to acknowledge him| even though he was the only person in the lobby. I was calling down to the front desk at the same time| and he said the guy just went back to playing with his cell phone and ignoring my calls in addition to my husband who was standing right in front of him.Eventually he was forced to acknowledge my husband| and said someone would be up to fix the tv| but 45 minutes later still no one had showed.I went down there to give him a piece of my mind and the front desk staff was totally ambivalent about the fact that we were not being taken care of.  I had to stand there at the front desk and wait until my husband upstairs texted me that the repair guy had stopped by.And then even after all that- the next time we turned the tv on| it was broken again.Totally would NOT recommend.,0
Great location. Easy to get to everything New York!,1
It was stinky and very poor service,0
Good location. Need to improve the work service,1
When we came back on our second night| our key didn't work. The receptionist said Expedia only booked us in for one night but we were staying for 2 and paid for 2 already. He said it was Expedia's fault and he had to charge us for a second night if we wanted to stay another night| but somehow our stuff was still in the same room? Then he ‚Äúcoincidentally‚Äù found my name under a ‚Äúdifferent hotel room number‚Äù and it was booked wrong on the second night| after I argued we were paid for 2 nights.,0
No towels and bed was not changed or room cleaned. When called to request towels they said in 15 minutes despite calling multiple times did not get until next day Elevators did not work half the time. Hotel and rugs in room were filthy. Hilton shame on you!!!,0
The elevator was very slow to open. At times we had We called guest service several times to get some towels and toilet paper but never received it.,0
Did not get the room (2 dbl beds) we reserved at check in. This was resolved the next day thankfully. Rooms are not cleaned daily. Didn't know that. When we asked for extra towels| they were never delivered. We found housekeeping carts and got towels that way.Garbage piled up in the room since it was cleaned for three days.,0
I really really recommended for this hotel it's very convenient to go 'cause it's near metro and they have many restaurants nearby.its close to central park | time square and many famous place in NY.‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê,1
I liked the hotel very much. It was very well located from one point to central park and other to times square. We stayed for 3 nights and we didn't get the room cleaned but because of covid it is understandable. Room was just like pictured.,1
Staff was not helpful. They say they are going to do something and don't come through.,0
Very good location| near by a lot of attractions,1
It was a bad experience,0
Staff was helpful and friendly! Great area| close to everything.,1
The room was dirty. There was spilled coffee coffee on the TV table and on the carpet. I wouldn't stay here again,0
Our room was not clean. There were no bags in the trash bins. Our TV remote was missing and when we finally received one| the TV did not work. There were no washcloths and barely any toilet paper and tissues left. Worst part was not having a working AC our entire trip. When we initially advised the front desk staff| he claimed he will send a tech up within 15 mins. It was over 78 degrees in the room and after waiting over an hour| we decided to wait in the lobby. It was around 12am and we did not get an answer about the status of the AC till 1:30am. It was working when we went back up to our room and stopped working in the middle of the night. We advised the front staff again| before leaving for the day| and came back to a hot room again. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone| especially for the price per night. I was very disappointed with my experience here and will not be returning.,0
Staff was friendly| helpful and nice!,1
"I had one of the worst experiences in a hotel I have had in many years of traveling around the world and it was even more frustrating because it was in a ""recognized"" hotel chain like Hilton.Starting with the size of the rooms| we book a double double room to accommodate 4 people| I have to say that the room was so small that placing 2 double beds there was an effort and off course that is not what you see in the pictures.Next thing| when I requested to have my room cleaned I was informed that their policy ""because of COVID"" is to clean the room every 5 days which was not mentioned in any part during my reservation| if I would have known I would have chosen other hotel. But that may be my mistake| the work part was that even after 5 days (I stay 7 days) I requested no less than 3 times to have my room cleaned but never happen during my 7 days stay.To continue with the experience| in a room for 4 people they placed 2 towels and off course we requested another 4 towels| they brought 2 towels again and every time we needed the towels changed we needed to wait long time in the line. Similar with shampoo| toilet paper and any other thing we may need. It was like being in a cheap AB&B but paying full hotel prices.Laundry without soap available| useless business center but even all those problems would be forgivable if there were at least the intention to serve. What was more annoying was the general attitude from the hotel staff of ""it is not my problem"" stop bothering.",0
If there was an option to rate below terrible for staff friendliness and cleanliness then I would preferably select that. My 6 nights in New York has been a sore disappointment because of this hotel. The door of the room was jammed| it could only be opened with force. In case of an emergency I could never get that door to open my self. The knob of the bathroom sliding door would come out every time you would slide the door. The carpet had patches of dirt and weird smell. The bedsheets had hair on them. To top it off they would only clean your room on the fifth day of your stay regardless of how many times you request for it. Their staff will miscommunication hotel policy and say anything to get you off the phone or away from the front desk. When you try to address these issues to a supervisor| the Assistant Manager would say ‚Äúsure| I'll be‚Äù when you ask if he is the General Manager. They are extremely disrespectful and dismissive to their guest. I had to wait for 40 minutes to be given a room even though I went at the check-in time. If you want to have a good time in New York| avoid going to this hotel. It is not worth the money and stress!,0
We always enjoy staying at this hotel because of the location (right between Times Square and Central Park!). During this stay| our room was clean and comfortable with a nice street view. However| the customer service was a little disappointing this time around ‚Äî the staff members that checked us in and out were not very friendly. Overall we had a good stay| though.,1
Newer property with great location. However| it's being worn badly in high traffic areas and the rooms aren't being maintained well.,1
Room was very clean. Loved the bathroom. Check in was fast! They held our bags afterwards. Would definitely recommend!! 10/10! I'll be back to stay again,1
We enjoyed our stay immensely and didn't want to leave!,1
The location of this hotel is extraordinary| with easy access to theaters| transportation| and Central Park.Unfortunately| this hotel is very poorly managed. They have very few cleaning staff| who have tremendous turnover. We couldn't check in at 4:00 pm because they did not have a clean room; for our entire stay they did not have cleaning staff for daily service for our room (8 days). We had to ask the front desk for towels| soap| and trash bags. The carpets are filthy throughout the building. The washing machines| dryers| coffee machine keep breaking down. At times| there is no hot water. College students are using the hotel as a dorm| so it feels like a hostel and not like a Hilton. We witnessed job interviews of cleaning staff hiring| where the interviewee was offered a job to start right away after she stated that she did not have prior experience and did not know how to clean a hotel room. The room safes were too small to hold laptop computers and we had serious concerns for the safety of our devices with the hotel's off-the-street hiring practice and staff turnover.The hotel has very little common space for sitting| eating| or socializing. Our room had two queen beds| but only one office chair to sit. The only place to sit in the room was the beds. The bedsheets did not fit and the sheets and mattress covers kept coming off the mattresses. Nothing in this hotel is as it should be at a Hilton Garden Inn. They should take off the logo.,0
The rug that led into the living was soaked. The room smelled like mildew. The fridge defrosted and was leaking onto the rug.,0
Was charged $60 more than the reservation cost on Expedia!,0
Great time.. Beautiful room!!!,1
The hotel was centrally located with easy access to public transportation.  Very nice staff and rooms are a decent size for NYC.  Very happy with our stay and would recommend to anyone looking for a mid-town hotel!,1
We went to the hotel at 4:57 pm and the room was still not ready while the checkin time was 3:00pm. They did not even give any discounts and moreover it said breakfast buffet but there was no hot breakfast they only had frozen sandwiches. Would not stay here agian.,0
When I entered the building and saw it had a D energy rating I almost backed out but I registered anyway. They then informed me that they were not cleaning rooms even though Covid restrictions are lifted. The room was made up when I entered but the carpet had stains from I hope spilled coffee. Next morning they informed me that the Coffee machine was broken and the breakfast was nothing at all. They did give me a coffee pod for the room but no cream or sugar. The bed was not comfortable and the internet was crappy. Not sure I have ever stayed in a worse hotel.,0
The room was ok|  however the AC unit was super loud and couldn't get a comfort sleep.  I also asked for additional tower and it never arrived,1
Excellent option for staying in NY close to every place of interest. I will give five stars if the room was bigger and spacious for two persons. If it was for me alone would be ideal and receive 5 stars,1
The room was not clean and service was bad| We had to wait 2 hours and call 3 times to get a towel.The room was as small as the bed and was not cleaned before we checked it. We hardly slept that night and left the next morning.,0
breakfast was not warm breakfast| it conisted of banana muffins and coffee. Not bad just not what I expected.,1
Two TOTAL elevators for 34 story building| with a third that was non operational. Both were shared as service elevators as well. Staff= worst service ever| after you wait 30 mins or more to ask a question. Need something?  Try waiting for 2-3 hours for a towel to be sent to your room. We stayed 5 nights and were unable to get any face towel replacements because they ‚Äúdidn't have any‚Äù.  Forget about the so called breakfast. It's a waste. Off brand frozen breakfast sandwich and cut-rate awful bite-size pastry. I wouldn't feed the homeless with that crap. Coffee machine was always broken or out of supplies. Except for the location| this place was the worst.,0
the location is excellent| not that centric but close to everything and the metro is like 3-4 blocks away,1
The property is ok for the weekend if you need to stay in the City| is small| and the room is clean,1
Room floor was wet probably moldy. They didn't offer a discount and said the hotel was fully booked therefore we couldn't get another room. Worse place ever.,0
Service was no good. To many kids running thru the halls at night. Tv didnt work. Had to move rooms on the first night. Not enoug workers.. i didnt recieve my points,0
Awesome location! With-in walking of everything you'd want to see and more. Free umbrellas to use for when ever it's raining. Staff was awesome. Clean rooms.,1
Room was very clean but the mattress was terrible. No support and made a lot of noises every time you movef,1
The hotel have a great location looks new or renovated rooms are comfortable beds and all inside are really good. I need to come back often and I will stay again definitely.,1
One elevator out of two not working| i was charged by hotel after check out and im still trying to find out why,0
Staff not ready to help. There is no customer service on front desk| because Staff not prepared to listen| they just don't want to understand the problem and find a solution. Very limited to their procedures without understand how it works.,0
The hotel needs a lot of maintanance! Furniture broken,0
Location is unbelievably on point with restaurants all arround.. subway transit minutes away. Minutes to Time square| top of the rock and central park. Loved it.,1
great location! great view!  nice size room,1
The only complaint is that the refrigerator wasn't working. However we were giving a new one that worked... everything was great,1
I stayed 2 nights| arrived Friday evening and left sunday morning. No one showed up to clean the room on Saturday| even to collect the trash| nothing. Sunday by 9am the housekeeper knocked the door. Really?! Very desorganized!,1
"Called front dest because the mini fridge wasn't working. Was told that it wasn't a fridge| its a ""cooler"" and I can go down to the restaurant to get ice to put it in and that should keep the ""cooler"" at a low temp. The room was supposed to have a mini fridge. It was clearly a fridge that was broken. Instead of dealing with the problem| they threw this ridiculous lie at me. Was too tired to deal. Make sure your MINI FRIDGE works!",1
There was only ONE PERSON doing the check in at 3pm. Very disappointing.,0
Hi| everyone was so accommodating I was staying overnight for a hospital stay and the night before anything I asked for was brought to my room. Peter the young man who brought me more towels and so on was a wonder.  He made sure I had everything I needed and took good care and the staff on the front desk were wonderful.,1
It was nothing less than great place to stay!!! I enjoyed my night and so did my kids and husband. We will book again,1
Great hotel loved everything about the staff and room beautiful,1
Bed was old and sunken in| bedding was thin and uncomfortable| pillows were old and used| and room was FREEZING! I set temperature to 70 and I didn't rise above 67 all night on the thermometer.,0
Close to my work location. Very convenient when I'm working long hours,1
Hotel was extremely  comfortable. I originally stayed two nights due to weather because of the work. I ended up staying an extra night.Only thing is my fridge wasn't working.,1
Nice room| comfortable bed| great shower. Enjoyed the flat screen TV and coffeemaker. There was a problem with the heat in the room and a technician came up right away to fix it. Room service menus were good and so was the food. Could have had a couple more House Blend coffee pods. Overall great stay.,1
Stay was ok. Room was a little tight I was expecting more space but it wasn't a deal breaker. Elevators are slow| but they have signs posted letting you know peak times which are during the week. However on a Saturday and with less people traveling it was still busy. Check in was easy and quick.,1
Due to Covid elevators allowed only 2 per elevator or per group. Lines were long elevators took forever. Other than that our stay was great!,1
Great location!,1
This property was very clean and the staff was extremely friendly.,1
Selected the property for convenient location and price point.,1
The Keurig did not work and the cold water in the sink did not either.   Overall lovely hotel.  We did not say anything about it as we did not want anyone in the room during our stay.  When we checked in they explained that during the current pandemic there would not be usual room cleaning and if we needed something specific to let them know.  We were fine with that.,1
I booked a room with a terrace but when I got there they told me that the rooms with the terrace were limited and only on the 2nd floors The room that they gave me was on the 24th floor which I didn't request. I think the room info on Orbitz was wrong because I booked a smoking room with a terrace and a city view. The desk agent told me this was a non smoking property so I was confused. Overall my stay was okay it was in a great location near pretty much everything you would need for a Manhattan stay. I would stay here again.,1
Great place to stay in Manhattan. Conveniently located between Central Park and Time Square!,1
Great location| central to Time Square| Central Park and the subway.  Great restaurant located within the hotel as well| amazing food!,1
Clean room| cozy bed| great price. Had an issue with the toilet in the room but the manager switched our room promptly and fixed it. Not our favorite ny neighborhood/location but was close to our friends and the park so worked well for this particular trip!,1
Empty hotel ! No wait for elevators ! Clean rooms and coffee cups. Extra towels. Free food.,1
Friendly staff & great location! No hassle!,1
Everything was fine except there was no hot water in the shower. Staff was friendly and room was clean.,1
It's located right around the theater district and the staff is really nice,1
The hotel was clean and comfortable. The staff was very helpful. It's a great location for Midtown Manhattan.As with other reviews I have read the parking was very expensive. There are garages all over that part of town I certainly would encourage anyone to search out their own parking | however it was convenient to have the valet deal with my vehicle for the weekend! Sometimes you need to treat yourself.,1
Location great| bed comfortable| hotel staff very friendly,1
Great location| clean and pretty room.  I had a king bed| large room given it's NYC| 28th floor.  Elevator is slow and the line is long.  Front desk could use another person at check-in.  Coffee downstairs in the morning.  Empire Steakhouse is in house and offers room service with a 20% markuo and $6.50 and delivery fee.  I think that's ridiculous.  I did eat there - unimpressed.,1
Everything was awesome - only negative was wait time for elevators so we frequently walked the stairs up to the 15th floor.,1
Convinient lacation | just few minutes from Time Square  | 5th Ave. | Central Park...,1
Foremost| the staff is exceptionally nice and accomodating. The double bed hotel room itself is very clean and comfy yet a bit cramped. As most everyone will attest| the elevators are not sufficient for amount of rooms and service staff also must use them to get around so patience needed. Bottom line...really good midtown location. Accessible to so many nyc attractions. We were in town to be out and about enjoying and not spending much time in hotel so could overlook tight space...Reminds me of small nyc apartment I lived in for many years as a young new yorker years ago. Honestly| I do recommend this hotel for a few days stay but if longer look for more spacious accomodations.,1
The location is perfect| central but not too close to Time Square.  Lots of great bars and restaurants in the Hells Kitchen area.Lovely touch to have coffee| tea and cookies in reception.Although the cookies had all gone one day. And the coffee in the morning| no milk or stirrers.The staff were very helpful from booking our taxi to the airport| helping with queries or just general hello in the morning.I had booked a room with a street view...it wasn't really.  More of a small street view with a view of many buildings| but it was fine.  The room was a great size| lovely bathroom and huge shower.The only thing which wasn't good in the hotel..the lifts. A nightmare. With 34 floors. Stopping at many| it took so long to go up and down.  If this can be sorted| then it would be perfect all round.,1
Great location to explore nyc| steps from Time square. The rooms are new and exceptionally clean. Staff is very welcoming and helpful at all times. We checked in late and exhausted after long delays at the airport. We accidentally forgot a gift bag in the lobby; the staff found us and safely delivered the bag. Losing the Lego in it would have been a huge disappointment for my 4-year old nephew. Thank  you!,1
I paid for a king room and was given two bed. I shouldve been told about this by either the hotel or expedia,0
Excellent in every way!!,1
Good location| clean rooms... small elevators made it difficult with large crowds getting to the room,1
The staff at Hilton Garden Inn were lovely. Someone greeted me whenever I came in and out| and the room was spacious for Manhattan. This is a great hotel in the middle of everything but far enough away from Times Square to be quiet (at least on the 23rd floor). I couldn't have asked for a better experience.,1
I had to pay a 'deposit' alongside paying for my stay at check in. At checkout I was reassured that the deposit would be refunded right after. Instead of getting the refund back Hilton deducted the entire amount of the stay another time. So I payed the whole amount twice| and no one at Hilton seems to bother to even answer my message| let alone refund me..,0
Room size was good and staff were very friendly. Amenities and everything were great too. Hotel was also relatively quiet| which I wasn't expecting - my room was right next to the elevator and I slept like a baby.,1
Clean room| good shower| nice coffee bar in the morning in the lobby.  Nice staff and great location to everything.  Would definitely stay there again!,1
Excellent location. Rooms are clean and just enough space for NYC. The only down was the elevators and I was able to hear everything in the room besides mine. I was out most of the time so that was not a big issue.,1
Amazing location. The room is very clean and fairly spacious for NYC. We had two queen beds which was key. We were very close to Central Park| Broadway| Times Square| you name it. I'm a Hilton honors member| but because I booked through Expedia we weren't allowed free bottle of water. But turned out to be not such a big thing as they had the most delicious raspberry water available in the lobby every day. I would absolutely stay here again.,1
Perfect and central location to the events we were scheduled to attend.  On the last day/night we heard this annoying buzzing sound like a cell phone which wouldn't stop.  Had we stayed an additional night we would have notified the front desk.  The staff was very pleasant and helpful.  Will definitely be returning during future visits to New York.,1
Amazing if ever in New York best place to stay at !,1
There was no basic items such as tooth brush and tooth paste. Furthermore| there was no blanket!!!! Is it possible?I don't know that this hotel is worth as the price.,0
Everything was great except the heating system because of the cold room that never warmed up all night.,1
The room was small but comfortable.  Mid-town location was excellent!  Coffee in the lobby was hot and delicious.  Our only complaint was that the elevators were not able to handle the volume of patrons| resulting in long waits.,1
The hotel is in a great location near Central Park| Times Square & Rockefeller Center.  We walked everywhere.  We ended up with a two queen room that was big enough for us| I wish it had an area wide enough for a small twin blow up mattress but it did not.  The room was clean & nice. Parking is pricey at most hotels| this one had $70 or $75 valet parking.  We ended up reserving parking at a nearby garage via the web.  That worked out well| just $35 but we had to walk to and from it.,1
Overall very pleased with the hotel| everything in great condition| brilliant location| very comfy bed and all mod cons| was especially handy having a fridge and microwave in the room| the shower was always piping hot and the room was cleaned daily with toiletries replenished daily| our room was behind an elevator shaft and was suprisingly peaceful. Only small criticism was it was not clear what things in the room were free to use (aside from the bottles of water that were labelled as 3 dollars each if used) the coffee machine had no instructions on how to use either or if the sachets of tea and coffee were chargeable. Reception had flavoured water and cookies on offer for free in the afternoons but limited supply| but in the mornings were weren't sure if the tea and coffee items left out were free either| better signage and info needed really. Also the towels were not very large for using in the shower. Staff friendly and useful bag check area for when we arrived before check-in and left the bags with them on our last day.,1
The hotel is a little worn but in a great location| and the staff was very accommodating. The restaurant that adjoins the hotel and serves the complimentary breakfast is not owned by Hilton and is not the same quality. The breakfast ‚Äòmanager' was quite rude and there were limited health food choices.,1
This was my very first time staying at the Hilton Garden Inn/Central Park. I normally stay at the Millennium Hilton in the business district but they were booked. Although the room was nice| the mini refrigerator did not function properly and was not up to code as far as the proper  temperature for a refrigerator| our sink was constantly leaking around the faucet area and my room was very close to the maintenance closet so I would hear constant shutting of the door but at a reasonable time of the morning hours. Also the Elevators were very slow. The best things about this Hilton are having access to a variety of restaurants| your within walking distance to Time Square| Columbus Circle which has an indoor mall and Whole Foods and of course your not too far from Central Park. I still would give it a go and stay again!,1
Room wasn't ready!!Coffee maker was broke| shower cover was off and safe wouldn't work!They did give us some free breakfast for the inconvenience! But it was run down a little and Libby very crowded!,0
Downgrade without any compensation nor information Room not ready at 5pm. Average waiting time for a lift above 20 Minutes. Staff rude and not professional. The worst experience of the decade!,0
Rhis is an exceptionsl.place for friends and family,1
Love the location.Slow elevator availability during peak times are inconvenient.,1
Clean property and location is excellent . Walking distance to time square . Staff are helpful and friendly . Definitely would stay again .,1
The location was great| but it was a little pricey.,1
room very comfortable| spotless bathroom (shower only)| nice staff. surprise complimentary snacks in lobby one afternoon. Complimentary tea/coffee in mornings in lobby. Elevators are a problem. On 2 occasions had to walk down 9 floors as elevator never came.  Getting a bit older to go down so many flights. Location is very good.,1
There was a huge wait at check in around 3 pm.  The desk staff was nice...but| the scent in the lobby was so strong...at first I thought it was a guest...but| it is everywhere in the hotel...public spaces...not in our room. A fake plug-in type smell .  really horrible.elevators were so slow...more than a 15 minute wait and not at the peak times noted by the elevators...had to take the stairs several times,0
The fridge had to be pulled out completely to turn it on (it was off and heavy)| the tv had a horrible lower dim to it so we couldn't watch anything| water pressure was bad and took 10 minutes with water running to finally heat up| heater was set to 80 to feel any sort of heat and it was still cold in room (wasn't even that cold outside)| elevators were small and kept going out of service in a hotel that has nearly 40 floors. Overall bad experience for my girlfriends 21st birthday celebration. A refund should be issued for this kind of experience. Wouldn't give this a hotel another chance otherwise,0
The room was comfortable. The location excellent. But| most remarkable| was the friendliness and efficiency of the staff. Everyone we encountered from check in to check out was superb. We'll be back!,1
I was assigned to the 34th floor| which had a great view and was above most of the street noise.  That was a plus.  On the other hand| if you tried the elevators during a busy time| they would stop at many floors and that slowed things down.  Not much to complain about though.  The staff were extra friendly and helpful| the room was clean and comfortable -- all in it was a wonderful stay!,1
Standard was excellent and position in NY was amazing.,1
Stayed here so we could walk to Trey Anastasio at Carnegie Hall. Did not disappoint. Didn't impress| but didn't disappoint. We got exactly what I expected. Very reasonably priced.  If you don't listen to Phish| you should.,1
Great staff| very friendly and helpful.  Super location and walking distance to major attractions. Felt safe in and outside hotel.  Room felt cramped between desk and bed so we didn't have a spacious room| but it was adequate.  Comfortable bed and great to have AC.,1
Excellent location| walk to Central Park| Times| Square| Columbus Circle| etc.  Had a room with outdoor terrace| not hotel's fault but extremely noisy with roof-top air conditioners directly beside.  Only hotel complaint was the mattress was uncomfortable| however that is always subjective.,1
This is a excellent location. Walking distance to the time square. Great location and clean. I would stay again.,1
The wait for the elevators was unacceptable. Period! Very inconvenient.,1
For the life of me I can't understand why this hotel gets so many positive ratings.  My reservation was screwed up| even though I had paid in advance.  The rooms are tiny| and it is nearly impossible to work with a laptop at the narrow desk.  The bathroom was only so-so clean| and there was abundant hair on the floor.  Th elevators are grossly inadequate for the number of rooms| and there is frequently a 5-10 minute wait -- or longer -- for the elevator to arrive.  The location is fine if you have to be in the northern Times Square neighborhood| but there are so many other choices in the area.,0
We loved this hotel!! The room was comfortable and clean. The location is perfect- close to everything| yet not too noisy. And above all| the service was impeccable! Very professional and always with a smile.,1
The location could not be better. Free coffee every morning in the lobby. Flavoured water free in the lobby everyday all day. Close to a multitude of restaurants and subway stations. The staff were very friendly.,1
Location was great as close to all things that we wanted to see,1
About what I would expect from a 3 star hotel. I had limited need but in general the staff was nice and friendly. Hotel was a little run down in general but clean and in a good location. I was| however| disappointed with their concierge service| specifically with my transportation to the airport. It was more money than Uber or Lyft but decided to use it as I expected a decent car| as opposed to not knowing with the other services. I was wrong.  The car was clean but small and not better than the other services. The person barely spoke English but managed to tell me 3 times| including showing me on the payments slip| that the tip was not included on the overpriced ride. Won't use their service ever again. Not a great last impression. Overall the hotel was okay. Not great but not bad either.,1
The location is great| the rooms are clean but the hallways need a refresh they are very old and need new flooring. Preferably not carpet!,1
Really nice stay,1
Desk staff very helpful.....elevators TERRIBLY SLOW!!!!!   Good location for everything we did each day,1
The location of the hotel is subpar because the  street is dirty and ugly.  I wont stay there again.,0
Stay was good. Location worked out well for whatI did.,1
Location was awesome! Most of the staff was friendly and helpful,1
Check in was very busy. Took a long time seemed understaffed,1
Great location| friendly/helpful staff| sometimes slow elevator service.,1
Staff are welcoming and kind. The room was spacious and clean.  Thanks for a great stay,1
Enjoyed the location and service| would stay here again.,1
Friendly staff| comfortable| nice amenities. Everything as expected,1
"My daughter and I went to NYC to visit the consulate for a visa. An important document arrived just minutes before our appointment. The routers in the business center were not working so we went to the front desk for help printing out our documents. The staff went above and beyond to assist us and get us out the door on time. We arrived in a heat wave and they had provided a ""cooling station"" of ice water|  complimentary Italian ice and a fridge full of chilled hand towels- very thoughtful. The location and room were great. Dinner next door at PepperSteak was delicious! The breakfast that was included far exceeded my expectations! Overall- excellent experience.",1
Awesome Service Excellent Very good Will be back,1
Location is amazing. Friendly staff.  Two queen beds were great.  Hotel very quiet.,1
Location was great. Staff eager to assist. First trip for 15 yr old daughter and my 49 ye old boyfriend great overall!!,1
During peak times| the elevators are very slow in arriving.  Close to subway and things we wanted to walk to.,1
Everything was very pleasant| no complaints at all.,1
Clean| comfortable room!,1
This was a nice place with easy access to most of the attractions.  Getting information about the city was almost nonexistent.  But the staff was pleasant enough. Overall pretty decent place.,1
We had a wonderful first time in NYC experience and this hotel was a big part of it. Perfect location as it is close enough to get to everything and just out of the mix enough to be just out of it. A few blocks to times square one way and a couple blocks to Central Park the other way and the subway station is also right there. We found our favorite deli for breakfast or lunch (Premiere Deli) being right near this location and our favorite local bar to watch a game too (Faces and Names). LOVED both of them| repeatedly. The bar and restaurant located inside the hotel was fine| we just opted to have our NYC food experience outside of the hotel. We are already planning on our return visit and would like to stay here again. The staff was outstanding and the room/service was great.,1
Great location. Friendly staff and reasonable sized room for NYC.Pleasant decor in room but minimal extras- paper cups no glasses.Very slow lift.,1
All the stall were very nice. The room was very clean. However| when I plugged in my phone charger| the outlet sparked and the other one didn't work.,1
Hotel staff was very friendly.  Rooms were small but very clean and comfortable.  Location was 5-10 minute walk to Times Square.,1
Ok location| small rooms| terrible customer service. Not worth paying over 300 for one night,0
location| fruit water and treats| coffee in the lobby| friendly staff!Decent gym:),1
Good overall. Clean| updated|and Modern. Room was small but comfortable. Location was great| just a few short blocks from Times Square. My only complaint was the noise. Someone close to our room had a baby that literally cried nonstop all night.,1
Good location if you are interested in the Times Square area or Central Park.  Clean rooms.  Decent number of elevators.  Small lobby,1
The front desk staff were excellent| friendly| efficient| professional ... same for the restaurant staff ... really great!,1
Great hotel and great location.  Very clean!  Staff pleasant and helpful.I will be back :-),1
The hotel is in a great location| just far enough away from Times Square to offer a little bit of quiet. You can walk to Times Square within 8 minutes. The hotel and staff are great. Only negative is the wait for the elevators is pretty long| no matter the time of day.,1
The gal at the front desk is why I didn't give this a great rating.  She was really unwelcoming and made me feel bad upon checking in... more like a robot.  The rooms are a bit small but it is NY so expected it.  The rest was good.,1
The room was very spacious and clean feeling. All the usual amenities (refrigerator| microwave| safe| etc) were organized in a way that made the room feel cozy and more likes studio apartment than a hotel room. The hotel is in a convenient location- walking distance to many NYC sites.,1
Two out of the three elevators were not working and the third was having difficulty. Staff did not compensate us for any inconvenience,0
Everything went very smoothly. The staff was exceedingly attentive and polite.  We felt very welcomed.,1
A brand new and well maintained hotel with exquisite staff at all e to levels| truly concern for our comfort ‚ÄòTwas a specially prosessional in addressing the not functioning the heater problem and resolved in minutesConfortable super. Clean close,1
Great location   Long wait for elevators.  Clean room,1
Great location & service was outstanding. Very professional,1
Excellent hotel - highly recommended: lovely| friendly staff comfortable well appointed room . received a very warm and inviting greeting upon my very late  arrival  after challenging travel - all of which was just what I needed. Will would return happy !,1
The rooms are spacious for 2 people. it was comfortable.  would have liked clean sheet every day but that would be my only complaint.  it was a nice location with good staff.  loved the coffee every morning in the lobby.  the creamers are a great touch!  would highly recommend this hotel.,1
Other than that| this was a nice hotel and I would stay again.,1
Good location.  Elevators take a long time so plan accordingly if you need to be somewhere on time.,1
Great service| great location and price. Will definitely stay again.,1
Room wasn't ready; room was extremely small with hardly any walking space; elevators were very slow.,0
The room was very clean| house keeping staff also very friendly and obliging. Location excellent| bed very comfortable| room updated| aircon which worked really well,1
Great| central location with superb city skyline views.  Easy walks to subway lines| Central Park| Times Square.  Bars| restaurants and shopping are all nearby as well.  Excellent business center and helpful staff. Great base for a trip to NYC.,1
Lovely hotel in a perfect location! Very comfy modern rooms| big king bed and super friendly staff! We were a 5 minute walk from Times Square and Central Park and 2 minutes from a subway station| it was ideal for getting around the city. I would definitely stay here again!,1
It's a nice room and we got upgraded to a kind bed| but the shower door didn't close. It seemed the door was too big and wasn't constructed properly. Also the elevator took over 15 minutes. On our last morning| there was an extremely loud steam-like whistle coming from the walls. Someone came very promptly to check it out though| which I appreciated. Overall 3.5/5,1
great location and good value.  Have to wait a long time for elevators.,1
"We had to move rooms 3 times due to noise. The first was because we had an ajoining room and our neighbors were up all night. They moved us to a ""quieter room"" only to be woken uo by a construction worker on the other side of our walling drilling and hammering in the early morning. We moved once more and ended up in another ajoining room which was just as loud as the first. Staff (except for one loveky girl) are apathetic. Ammenities are minimal. Restaurant is sub par. Would not recommended. Theres much better in NYC for a similar price.",0
Good central location to shops| restaurants.Small space| lobby area. Elevator wait time was appalling!  5-8 minutes each time for elevator.,0
Quick stay for work. Nice bar/restaurant with good food and service,1
Great location and clean rooms with comfortable beds. Long waits for elevator and loud staff.,1
Rooms a little on the small side.  Elevator service can be very slow.  Common areas need a little updating.,1
Great location| friendly staff.  Our room was the smallest hotel room we've ever had| despite being Hilton Honors member and requesting upgrade.,1
Not enough water to drink. Only 3 elevator.  It took so long waiting on the elevator.  A complimentary breakfast would be nice.,1
Very active area| but so nice to be close to so many subway stops| easy to get around!  Very clean room.,1
I really liked the location of the building. The friendly staff made me feel welcomed. My vacation was worthwhile by living in this location. Thanks,1
I was very pleased with our stay here. Great location| room and staff. I recommend.,1
It's very clean| spacious| and comfortable accommodation. If I go to NY next time| I want to stay here.,1
.great location| quiet and nice staff  would definitely return,1
Room was clean and quiet.,1
The elevators kept breaking down. Very annoying to stand in small lobby with large crowd waiting for an elevator,1
The close proximity to Central Park and restaurants,1
Great location for access to Central Park| Broadway and Times Square. Room very comfortable| but most do not have a bathtub. Staff very polite and helpful. Elevators become very busy at times.,1
The employees were very kind| helpful and always very courteous. The location was great and very close to the places I wanted to visit.,1
Extremely Friendly staff without being annoying.  Clean rooms and fitness center.  Good size room by N.Y. standards. Nice restaurant next door. Convenient to Times Square and Central Park. I would Definitely come back.,1
We chose the hotel for its location and it did not disappoint!  We will be back!,1
Loved the location and staff was super friendly. Everything was very clean. The only small thing we didn't like was the beds were fairly uncomfortable.,1
A good lodging.  Staff helpful.  Good location. Good rates.,1
Location was convenient; staff was helpful; elevators were fast,1
Extremely rude and inattentive staff. The only good experience was my check in experience. After that the staff were terrible,0
This is great hotel close to many New York must sees. The rooms are small but well appointed. Having a microwave and refrigerator was really handy. The restaurant and lounge had great service and food. Friendly staff on all levels at this location. We were close to metro stops and a ton of restaurant options. Broadway was our neighbour. I would certainly recommend this hotel and I will stay here again,1
Darren at the front desk was great!  Very helpful and accommodating. Also very knowledgeable| his suggestions made our stay memorable.,1
Nice hotel....very clean. Small| but it's NYC. Staff was good| elevator wait was not long. Would stay there again.,1
I recently stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn for a 5 day stay in NYC. It was the perfect base for sight-seeing and had all the comforts of home. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful with any questions we had. The check in and check out processes were seamless and fast. They even had water| coffee and snacks in the lobby each day. The room was a great size for two people with plenty of room for luggage and moving about. The fridge| microwave and coffee maker in the room were a great bonus! The bed was very comfortable which was great after a long day of walking around! The hotel is conveniently located to major attractions such as Times Square and Central Park. There is a subway stop close by to get to further locations. Some great restaurants and coffee shops nearby as well! Overall| this was an excellent hotel and I would definitely stay here again.,1
The staff went above and beyond to make us feel important and welcomed to the hotel! This happened each and every time we left or entered the building. If you met a staff member in the elevator| lobby or hallway they greeted you with a hello and have a great day! Superb interaction with everyone! We certainly would highly recommend this hotel to everyone and we will definitely return! Thank you for making us feel at home! Even better!!,1
The stay was great and the staff was friendly. I woulddefinitely consider staying again because it is in a such a good location that it made it easier to visit many locations in NYC.,1
The room was very clean and comfortable| I did not miss my bed at all! The location is great. Staff were friendly and helpful. The ice water in the lobby with fruit was a nice welcome when returning from walkabouts. We enjoyed our stay.,1
Hotel is quite compact. Rooms are small - little room around bed. Staff were great and helpful. Advertised as free wifi| but it would not work on my phone. Front desk gave me a free upgrade normally only available to their club member guests. Appears this happens quite often - why have two different levels of wifi?,1
Great Place to stay in the heart of all action,1
The hotel itself was nice.  The staff was friendly.  However| the room was awful. There was a huge gnat problem in our room.  There were a lot of gnats on the shower walls.  Some one from the maintenance crew came to clean the shower drain| after which the gnats started coming into the room.  The next morning the shower walls  had more gnats.  We will NEVER stay at that location again.,0
The pressure of cold water was too low and thus the water temperature was high.  The bed was so squeaky whenever I changed my position.,1
Great location.  Easy walk to local sites and subway.  Staff were very friendly and worked to make gou stay ennjoyable,1
Very very bad costumer service,0
Perfect location|clean| good| sanitized| good option| New York is thirsty of tourism,1
They charged for the water I did not take and another small amount is also charged. I do not get why such a small mistake of fraud happens.  I am now asking for refunds and seeing how it goes.,0
Location is excellent. The room is clean and comfortable. A great place for stay.,1
Very good hotel. Great location and clean. The lobby tends to get very crowded| and elevators as well.,1
Everything great! Location| state of renovation etc.,1
we loved it !!,1
It was a great stay,1
Good value and location near midtown Manhattan and great for a short visit.,1
Everything was nice and clean ! Only the parking it to expensive for a day 57 dollars that's a robbery.,1
Stayed here for 4 nights.  The beds were really comfy | rooms cleaned every day.  The bathroom was a good size .  I didn't eat any meals here as I ate out every day.  But the location is just excellent and as a base I would highly rate this hotel. The subway is so close and the view of the Empire State is spectacular. You also had a fridge and microwave in your room!   It's not luxury but if your looking to explore New York and want somewhere central that's great value well then I highly recommend the Hilton garden inn west 35th!!The staff are super helpful and friendly !,1
Very clean. Spacious room. Centrally locates; walling distance to everything midtown has to offer. Efficient and courteous staff. Refrigerator microwave coffee maker. Nice sitting lobby. Wifi no problem. 100% will stay here again.,1
They made everything super easy and we had a wonderful stay.,1
The location is perfect for msg events. There are plenty of restaurants and bars nearby,1
Tameika at the front desk is the best!! She was beyond helpful and friendly and very professional.She made my stay there perfect!!Perfect location-steps to bus stop| subway| Macy's| Manhattan Mall| Zara| H&M!!! Tameika gave some great suggestions and the best was Mew 2 doors down...great cocktails| vibe| sushi. Don't let the outside fool you.  Walking is easy and good.  Easy walk to Best Bagel and Coffee Shop| Paris Baguette| Empire State Bldg.| You will not regret staying here.  Room small but very comfortable. Water pressure in shower is great!!Highly recommend.Ask for Tam Tamü§ó,1
Great location and price. Very helpful staff. Quiet room.,1
Very clean| excellent location- centrally located and has a subway entrance rite outside the entrance to hotel! Staff are very friendly and accommodating,1
Friendly staff|  good location. However a bit noisy at night,1
Very pleasant staff. Rooms clean and have always had wonderful stay here. It is my go to hotel in NYC.,1
They property was amazingly clean and the staff was super friendly.,1
Awesome stay and in the middle of everything. We walked everywhere| time square is about a 5 min walk and Around the corner from the Empire State building.,1
Super comfy beds| great location and friendly staff,1
Perfect location and excellent service. I will use this hotel in the future.,1
Great value! Very quick check| even though we arrived early. Location was perfect. Comfortable bed. Our room| with the head of the bed| was right against the elevators| so that was a little uncomfortable. Better breakfast options would have been nice. But it was still an excellent option for the price.,1
Very good hotel.... is recomended.,1
Pam at the front desk was great,1
I liked the location of the property and the price.  I did not like that it didn't have valet and I was told the self park was around the block which I never did  find.,1
Everything was great during our stay in New York.,1
Really great overnight stay. Great location for MSG. Skip the breakfast. Not worth it. But restaurant across the street was very good.,1
Everybody was very helpful...i enjoyed my night stay before i moved on to my parents house.,1
It was clean| affordable| and conveniently located.,1
Great location| easy access to many subway lines and an easy walking distance to many attractions (Macy's| Empire State Building). Friendly staff and clean rooms. Simple| nothing fancy. My only issue was they charged my credit card for the full amount as a deposit and due to the exchange rate I lost $30 on the refund.,1
Great location and clean and quiet but nothing fancy,1
Great city views| comfortable.,1
Was a good experience,1
Great location. helpful staff. LOVE how they will allow you to leave your bags so you can explore the city. We used that service before we checked in and we checked out. Things were clean. Great safety with the keyed elevator. GREAT overall.,1
Refused me I was there,0
"This is a great little hotel.  It's just a few metres from Herald Square| Penn Station| Koreatown| and a million other things.  I've stayed at this location and few times and find it to be very well managed| friendly| and clean.  While Hilton Garden is pretty good in general| there is just something ""special"" about this particular location.  I always look forward to staying there.",1
The hilton Garden Inn was very clean and spacious.  The front desk staff was friendly.  I would definitely stay here again.,1
Great hotel for the price!  We got two nights over New Years Eve very last minute.  The rooms were clean| comfy| and very spacious for a NYC hotel. It was conveniently located near MSG and we had a really great view of the Empire State Building!  I would definitely stay here again.,1
Great location - Right next to a subway station| easy access to all scenic spots.,1
I enjoyed my short stay for the holidays. The room was small| hard to get in out of closet . Pillows way too soft. The room overall was cozy| comfortable and clean. The gym was good for a quick workout. Loved the dining area although they did not have any bacon. Loved the Kwanzaa arrangement displayed in front of the elevators. I would definitely stay again. Close to everything| Macy's| dining restaurants. It was a very positive experience. Had everything you need- microwave| refrigerator| safe. Very nice.,1
Great staff and great hotel location.Room size was not smaller than we thought,1
Only issue was the parking garage. People not very friendly at all. No hellos or thank you.,1
The location was excellent for me to be able to go back and forth to my meetings at Penn station. Lots of food. Safe area.,1
Close to lots- Time Square| Macy's| Bryant Park| Broadway| Rockefeller Center!,1
The staff was wonderful and very accommodating to any needs. The room we had was a very good size given it's location in downtown Manhattan.  Location was perfect! There were some issues.  Tub wouldn't drain properly and would flood when showering.  We were only there for one night so not too much of an issue but if we were there longer and were taking more showers it would be a big problem. Another issue was the elevators.  On our arrival day| one elevator was out of service the entire time. This left just 2 to service 20+ floors.  Once nighttime rolled around| a second elevator was out of service.  Now there was one single elevator to service 20+ floors at a time when many were coming back from dinners| shows| and late night outings.  At any given moment due to the first| then the second elevator being out| you would wait over 15 minutes for an elevator to come. By the time we got up and out our second day| all three elevators were working but still took about 7-8 minutes for one to come to you.  But again staff was wonderful and space was nice and that's all I can really ask for!,1
I did NOT like that the breakfast was not including as it was one of the reasons I choose this place.,0
The location was nice. Two bottles of water offered at check in after a long day of travel was nice,1
Male desk clerk was not welcoming| offered no info re breakfast options or any other hotel services. I had noted this trip was to celebrate my husbands birthday| but this was not even acknowledged in any way.Room was very shabby and in dire need of a refurbishment. Previous breakfast option has been replaced with a greatly inferior offering. Only plus point is the hotel's location. Even so I believe I will go elsewhere on my next visit to NYC,0
Service| location| room and view were all great. I would visit here again.,1
Very old looking bedrooms. Poor interior design. The lobby is very good. Bedroom size and furniture layout feels too small too. But the view is magnificent. I'd prefer a nice chair to enjoy the view. Thanks.,1
I was able to get an excellent rate at this hotel and had read the reviews which were positive overall.  I was happy to see that the reviews were accurate.  The staff were very friendly and welcoming.  The amenities were nice: fresh water bottles| coffee and tea in the room| wifi.  Parking garages were nearby but the affiliated garage was full.  I found a better garage (M parking) just up the block with a better rate which worked out well.  The room we were given was on the 31st floor and had amazing views.  Just what I had hoped for.  The only downside is that everything is a little worn around the edges and the sound barrier between the elevators and other guest rooms isn't great.  But it was manageable given the positives.,1
LOCATIONGREAT PLACENEAR THE SUBWAYGOOD SERVICE,1
We loved everything about this hotel although the size of the room was ridiculously small. We felt like we were shoehorned into the Hilton's smallest room.,1
The hotel was comfortable| the beds and shower are amazing| the staff were the best! The down side| the location to the ACE (blue) and 123 (red) Subway is a walk to Times Square| not so convenient| so plan for extra walking time. Another| I DO NOT recommend taking their car shuttle to the airport| even though the desk clerk told me and my husband it is cheaper than a cab (cost $50) it was MORE expensive| $65 a rip off~~did not see that coming!,1
Good service| great location| steps away from 34th Street Station. We'll be back.,1
Check-in was easy and brief| multiple elevators with quick service| the room was clean and no allergies triggered from our stay. The only odd detail was the fitted sheets were too small for the mattress (but the sheets felt freshly washed). Quick walk to Times Square where we were seeing a show.,1
I'm unclear as to which hotel the other reviewers stayed in because it can't have been the one we experienced. Aloof staff on reception| dated and poorly kept decor| damaged dirty rooms and sheets. The real kicker was a real problem with extreme static electricity in the bedding - visible sparks and couldn't sleep without sharp shocks waking us. In the end we had to strip the bedding ourselves and make do. Fortunately we only had one night and moved to The Langham (which is amazing). This hotel is really really poor value for money.,0
Everyone was friendly and helpfull.  They were able to get a handicapped taxi or u each time.,1
Location is amazing!!! Very close to metroRooms are small... especially if you're taking 2 beds. The 3 elevators can't cope with the amount of guests especially in the morning. Service is good very attentive,1
The bed kept making a sound. Even just by sitting on it. The people next door in the adjoining room kept trying to come through the door. And the walls were super thin. We could hear the tv next door.,0
Thank you,1
Very helpful at service desk|room space a little tight. Close to all NYC sights.,1
Great location and very clean comfortable rooms.  Highly recommend.,1
I loved the location of this property! I wish I could've had a view of Empire State but it was cozy and clean. I left my necklace and they had it waiting for me! Thank you so much!,1
Clean & comfortable| perfect for a short stay in the Big Apple!,1
Walls beat up in room near door. Looked scuff marks||||||||||,1
Best location and hotel!,1
I stayed with my family only to visit NYC and my family loved the conditions and location. Also| people in the hotel was also helpful and welcoming (nice and kind). Thank you,1
The room was very clean | comfortable beds | quiet place and excellent location !,1
The location of this hotel is perfect| next to a subway| round the corner from a breakfast bar and a 24 hour food court.  Across the road from a 24 hour Pharmacy| a three minute walk to Herald Square| Macys and other major shops.  The hotel is clean and the staff efficient and friendly.  The standard double room is small| but that is normal for all Hotel rooms in New York so I would not recommend more than two adults share a room. My only true negative is hearing the street noise from 6th Avenue during the night| if you are a light sleeper| the sounds of car horns| sirens and night construction may keep you awake.  We were able to purchase ear plugs from the Pharmacy across the street (I recommend the silicone ones) and that took care of the problem.  I would definately stay at this Hotel again for my next trip to New York.,1
Neat and clean hotel| good size rooms for New York| nice open views with good light| hotel is showing wear -The carpet in the room needs to be replaced| if there's new carpet it would've been a much nicer stay| I definitely felt there was some smoking going on which is not the hotels fault| I could smell it in the room| overall the interior of the room is just a bit tired| and it's only a brief stay but the lime green and brown decorum | is a real quandary :-) horrible combination.,1
Place was great but not having free breakfast was bad.,1
Had a wonderful time and stayed in a great room with a view of the Empire State building. The hotel is in a great location and the staff was great. We were able to check in a little early which was very nice. Only minor complaint would be that the outside noise did seem to penetrate more that I would of liked| but sirens and horns comes with staying in NYC. Overall| great experience.,1
Great property| room are a little bit small but overall it's fine. The staff is really good.,1
The customer service was pleasant. Nothing extra ordinary or friendly. The room needs a lot of improvements though. The room was very dark even with the bathroom light on and door wide open. Carpet is old and some wear are clearly visible near the bathroom and TV area| even in the dark. Bed covers need an update. The bed was uncomfortable but there was a good number of pillows. The headboard wall was an unpleasant dark green wallpaper. The room was clean. The standing lamp needed a new bulb| that was replaced the same day we called. Coffee maker and mini fridge in the room was good. The hotel is conveniently close to the train station and subway. There's a storage room for luggage while you wait for rooms to be ready and a cozy sitting area on the corner. The small bar was open for alcoholic beverages but we skipped that. They have a grab and go breakfast/snack corner if you're in a rush. We didn't purchase anything from there. It's an okay hotel and there are better ones in the same area for close to if not the same price but it was a long weekend so they'll charge according to occupancy demands. We are choosing another hotel brand next time.,0
Great location safe hotel clean and comfortable for business or vacation,1
Very clean| courteous and helpful staff| close proximity to everything .Comfortable beds| huge showers all the amenities of home -hair dryer| iron| ironing board| microwave| fridge. Nice clean cafe with breakfast items as well as lunch. If you are a Hilton Honors member it is free otherwise you pay for your food. Convenient for guests. Amazing view of the Empire State Building! Parking garage right down the street.,1
Good time for check out |the room was clean and good location near to subway.,1
This hotel was very clean üòäStaff was very friendly and helpful üòä,1
This Garden Hilton is comparable to a Holiday Inn Express.Breakfast would have been better at McDonald's around thecorner but less convenient. Its the location of the hotel just a fewblocks from Penn Station that is its great advantage.,1
Excellent location in the heart of Manhattan| and Kim was a very helpful member of staff.,1
The property was perfect and near all the attractions and stores. The staff was very polite and generous| i love the room I was in with the view of midtown. Everything went perfect!!,1
Breakfast should have been complimentary.Overall everything was fine.,1
Very clean room. Staff was very polite. Quick check out,1
Great experience.  Great view.   Very clean room!  Quick check in| and elevator to 31st floor wa very quick!,1
I like that my family especially my daughter who was being sworn in that mon. Sep 9th| loved the scenery of the empire state building right behind our room| and what i disliked is when arrived only 1 room was available| therefore we was told it be ready at 3:30 for us to come back| we did to find that it still wasn't ready| and lastly the final morning my mom snd daughter ran out of toilet paper called down stairs to let desk know| an hour went by and still no toilet paper| so my daughter finally called the desk again to cancel because no one responded| and 3min. Later they csme up with toilet paper.,1
Nice place good price and location| slight walk (1.5  lock) for parking and center of times square. No bible in the room and pillows weren't very good. Otherwise good to go!,1
Everything was excellent thanks.,1
The property was in a great location| within easy reach of the subway| shops| restaurants and attractions. Staff were very polite and helpful,1
Very clean and very nice & helpful staff!!! Definitely coming back!,1
When we arrived the front desk immediately made us feel like home.,1
Clean and friendly staff. Steps away from the Empire State Building Great walking location to all major streets and subways,1
I searched and read a lot of reviews before choosing a hotel in NYC where space is limited. Don't expect a typical size room but this room was just fine! Plenty of drawer and closet space. Microwave| fridge| and coffee maker. Comfortable a/c. Elevator didn't have any waiting. Subway close by or a couple blocks away depending which train you need. Right by Herald Square and Macy's| walking distance to Time Square| Uber was very accessible. We were in town for the U.S. Open so we didn't spend much time in the hotel| but it was nice to have plenty of space to unpack our things for the week.,1
Overall it was good... it would've been better if parking was included... had to park mikes away and walk to get to the room,1
I really enjoyed my stay at the Hilton Garden Inn! The staff was super friendly and the location was amazing! It was centrally located and in walking distance to shopping| Times Square| and Bryant Park!  The view of the Empire State Building from my hotel window at night was simply delightful.,1
The location was perfect for sight seeing. The staff were friendly and helpful. The building did not feel old and dirty.,1
This Hilton was an amazing value. Great location with a subway stop steps outside the door and a few blocks to penn station. Front desk staff was some of the beat I have ever had. They were so nice and friendly| they gave us bottled water at check in and gave my girls granola bars. Room was clean and good size for NYC. We could see the Empire State Building from our window. Will define use this hotel again!,1
I was there for only 9 hours mist of that was sleeping BUT front desk very accommodating. A women.... missed her name...when she heard driver| car| 5:00 AM. She was ON IT...,1
Great experience.. awesome location.. convenient location to get around NYC| & catch public transit.. Wonderful| accommodating staff.. Thank you.,1
Great Location. Check in was easy.,1
The hotel was in an amazing location. We had a fourth floor double room that had a view of a brick wall and two yucky windows. Hey it's New York! The room was small but workable fir three of us. The bathroom was pretty small but for one night ok. I think if we had been there a week would have been an issue. The wall in the room was pretty scuffed up so would do with some TLC.,1
Room wasn't ready when we checked in.Location is great for a concert.,1
Location was convenient to lots of things and room was quiet,1
Good location| clean| helpful staff. Only negative was that the room was pretty tight.,1
Convenient location| fantastic staff| very clean and comfortable,1
Very Clean| friendly staff. Cheap stay near the main attractions.,1
The staff was so nice and welcoming. We had a really great time here. It's the perfect location near Times Square and not to expensive.,1
Staffs were friendly and were we offered water on arrival.,1
Perfect location! If I was being overly critical I'd say the pillows were terrible.Walking distance and/or basically 3 stops from anywhere you'd wanna go. Clean & beyond great for the price point.,1
Overall| very happy with my stay. I got a room on the 29th floor with a city view and I was amazed at the view I got. Will definitely stay here again when it's a night out in NYC,1
Close to everything... Easy to get around... Choices abound...,1
The room was small| too small for a sofa| overlooking an office building| but the room was very quiet| the king bed was extremely comfortable| the amenities include a full refrigerator| and the bath and room were clean and updated. The location is great. We twice went to the popular Izakaya MEW restaurant next door down some stairs for Japanese food . We would stay again.,1
no breakfast| had to leave the property for good breakfast.|good housekeeping,1
I had a great stay at the Hilton Garden Inn!  I was in NYC for work.  Janice at the front desk was great as was Sean the bartender.  The room was clean and more spacious then many hotels I have stayed at in NYC.  The shower was great| good pressure and hot.  It was in a great location near my office (Empire State.)  I would recommend.,1
We felt spoiled staying at this hotel at such a reasonable rate for the location. We checked in late at night and were greeted by very friendly staff who checked us in quickly. The view from our room was great| with the Empire State Building right outside our window. Our room was clean and quiet. The noon checkout time was also perfect since we had a late arrival; we got the rest we needed to enjoy the day. Thanks so much!,1
We were on a two day tour of city. The location could not have been better! Hope to stay at Christmas.,1
Had a great stay here - perfect location| clean & spacious room,1
The room was smaller than I expected| but this hotel is at a great location. In walking distance of a lot of great stuff.,1
Stayed here for a night while on a work trip. Room was clean and large. Bed was comfy. Staff was pleasant upon check-in. Hotel is located right next to all major subway lines. There are a lot of restaurants in the area. I enjoyed my short stay.,1
The Garden Inn Hotel is wonderful Friendly staff| good sized bedrooms and really comfy beds. We were on the 24th floor and it was very quiet at night. It is only about 10 minutes walk away from Times Square and the subway station is just steps away from the front doors. Perfect.,1
It was worth the money spent and in walking distance to time square. The staff was extremely friendly.  Great experience. Would definitely come back and stay again.,1
The location is great| you are ckose to everything within walking dustance. The staff are friendly and heloful.,1
The ENTIRE staff was extremely friendly and professional. Front desk| housekeeping| bag check. The bed was very comfortable and that's a godsend considering I don't sleep well in hotel beds. Great location from the main bus stop. Overall excellent value. Will book again in the future.,1
Great location with very fast check in so could go straight to our room to rest,1
The staff was very friendly and helpful. Gave great advice on traveling around the city and to the airport.,1
My daughter and I greatly enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Garden Inn.  The room was immaculate; the bed was comfortable; the bathroom had a great power shower; the soundproofing was excellent; there were plenty of channels on the TV; the WiFi was optimal: there was a microwave and a mini fridge.  The staff were extremely helpful; the hotel is less than a block from public transit.  Would I stay there again!  Oh| yes| with pleasure!!,1
The hotel was perfect in every way. The staff was great and took care of everything we needed.,1
First time in NYC and we loved it! The hotel was very comfortable and clean. Location wise it was very convenient. Definitely will be back!,1
Great staff who helped both on Reception and guides fir the area. Extremely good location,1
Nice hotel. Great area. Very close to Subway and Path Train stations. Walking distance to Times Square| Empire State Building| etc. Room was clean. AC worked wonderfully. Refrigerator and microwave in room! Great customer service. Only issue (and it's not exclusive to this hotel) is that check-in time is very late. Thanks!!,1
Easy check in. Amazing location not far from where the mega bus dropped me off at. I would definitely stay here again.,1
Clean and comfortable. Steps from a subway stop and easy access to Penn Station. Nothing fancy| but a good price for the location.,1
Hotel was good once you get in. I had a late arrival at 11:30pm. Street outside was full of people lined up for the club in the hotel next door. Not a problem for me but some people may become stressed.,1
I asked the gentleman who checked us in if we could switch to the Hilton Garden Inn on 33rd street| as I booked that hotel in error| and he said no. When I went to the Hilton on 33rd street and talked to the manager there| she said that he should have let us switch since it was the same hotel.  Our bedding was horrible| not big enough to fit the bed so my husband and I were constantly fighting for the sheets.  And the bathroom was old and outdated.,0
The hotel was in a great location and all of the staff there were fantastic and were so friendly and helpful.,1
Loved the hotel staff Very nice hotel right by MSG Couldn't believe the price! Very happy about our experience,1
Nice hotel| great location.,1
Very convenient Location and friendly and helpful stuff.,1
The hotel as well as the room was clean. Even the room was smaller (typical for NYC) it didn't feel cramped. Staff was extremely nice and helpful!,1
The room was clean but could use a little refresh. The staff at the front desk were very helpful and kind. I needed to stay near Penn Station| so this worked well for me location wise (although Midtown is not my favorite area in the city!). I stayed for two nights and spent most of my time outside of the hotel.,1
Enjoy are stay everyone was f friendly different recommend this place location was great had a little issue with key but it got taken care of will definitely stay here again really enjoyed it first time staying at this hotel it was really nice,1
Location| desk clerk| room was cleanHard to see from the street.,1
Great location for visiting the garment district and other attractions.,1
Location good|limited facilities and our room was quite small and dated.,1
Great place great location. It's just next to the subway entrance Korean street. I enjoy the food there.,1
This hotel is close to Herald Square and Macys etc. it's right around the corner . Also only a few blocks to Times Square without all the madness . My room had a brilliant view of the Empire State Building. Lots of shops| delis||restaurants of all flavors. On top of the convenience to the subways | the price was outstanding,1
Loved the location 10 min cab to every attraction. The staff were incredible. The service was unbelievable. I was provided food options that were amazing. The hotel lobby is small with no restaurant and room was small but its NYC its understandable. Excellent value! Best deal. Definitely would stay here again!,1
The hotel was very nice. The staff were extremely friendly. The only downside is that the rooms are very small (it is New York|though).,1
I loved that we were able to leave our bags there until our room was ready for free.,1
Received wrong room| payed extra for specifics and did not receive even close.,0
Walking distance from Penn Station. Several restaurants within walking distance and close to public transit stops.,1
Parking service provided by hotel was not that reasonable.,1
Good no frills hotel.  Right on the edge of Ktown so lots of good Asian food| but not more than a 10 minute walk to Times Square| Penn Station| or Grand Central Station.,1
The stay was decent. There was confusion beginning with the site. It it had me double booked for the same dates| so wind up paying and extra $297| for a room that I did not book. Manager said it was too late to cancel and charged me. When I had a co worker who needed a room| I was told room was not available for stay b/c they resold the room after I paid for it. Manager (not helpful again) Refuse to offer any resolution. In addition| was told they would not honor my Hilton rewards| because I booked through Hotels.com and not them. Never experienced that before either| I travel weekly and always use a 3rd party site to book and never have this problem. They will never have to worry about me staying with them again. So disappointed in the handling of the situations.,0
Great location| 200 metres to the metro. Easy access to all the sights. Room was dated but much larger than I expected. It had a small fridge and a microwave. I found it odd that there was no crockery or cutlery for use in microwave| not even a cup or mug. I asked for a cup at reception| but they could only give me some cardboard ones!,1
Location was great. Near shopping restaurants and Amtrak,1
Hotel and staff were really great. They held our bags before and after checking in. The hotel was quiet and the beds were comfortable. Location close to lots of things. The only thing I didn't like was the $50 fee that the hotel charged above the price that I booked on Hotels.com,1
They took multiple amounts of money from my card after playing up front for my stay was assured I'd be refunded home now 3 wks and still have not received my refund. I have sent email after email and ha emt heard a thing back.,0
Great location and courteous staff. Spacious room by nyc standards.,1
This is a good choice if you're looking for basic economy| cleanliness| and location.  We stayed in NYC for 4 nights and this hotel was exactly what we needed.  Beds were comfortable| room was clean| location is good.  Quick walk to the subway just around the corner for good access to the city.  Room was a bit larger than others we've stayed in at NYC.  A little noisy outside the window but nothing out of the norm.  Would recommend as a good economy value.,1
Missed the breakfast restaurant that was there last time I stayed there.,1
When checking in| my two reservations were not listed in the hotel's database. They had to call Expedia to confirm the reservation existed| and was a huge waste of precious time while on a tight schedule.,0
They would not give us Hilton Honor points for the stay - bummer.,1
Great view of the city of New York| but a small room.,1
We enjoyed this garden inn. It was conveniently located near Penn Station and we were able to walk all of Manhattan. They are able to hold your luggage for you before and after your stay which is very nice in the city. We did not eat or go to the bar but it was nice that it was available. We had a beautiful view of the Empire State Building.,1
Excellent location steps from the subway and Herald Square. The staff were all super friendly and helpful.,1
It was very close to our venue|  The staff were excellent and accommodating,1
A nice place to stay| good location and friendly staff!,1
We frequently come to NYC and liked many midtown hotels. For this hotel we only Like one thing location.  Dislike many things: front desk lady| no complimentary breakfast| no coffee| no fountain water| no fruits| no pleased deco| no good price| no friendly offer an extended checkout hour. Will never book this one again.,0
2nd stay here| I will definitely be back!,1
Conveniently located near Penn Station - hotel was very busy with some kind of teen tour but one expects these things in NYC. Overall a nice and reasonably quiet place to stay.,1
The location was fantastic and the staff were helpful and polite. We had a great city view from our room.,1
Love it close to everything even to Penn Station which took me to Boston. Will be back someday.,1
Convenient location| cost-efficient and clean. AC in my room was quite noisy and tended to turn on in the middle of the night| otherwise no complaints.,1
"Love the bag check in when the rooms aren't ready ""early"".",1
Excellent location and a majority of the staff were very friendly| Jay was great. Expedia messes things up a little as when I cancelled my Hotels.com booking it cancelled Expedia but the hotel managed to find us a room. The rooms are a little dated but for a NYC hotel it was excellent value for money. Having a microwave| fridge and coffee machine in the room was bonus. Would definitely book this hotel again.,1
It was clean| the staff was great| the rooms were a decent size. It was just a bit of an older building.,1
Will stay again on my next visit.,1
Close to our MSG event.,1
The location of this hotel cannot be beat| right next to a subway station| and about a 5 minute walk from Penn Station. Pricing was reasonable. Service was good. The rooms themselves were clean and the pillows weren't the most comfortable. My only real complaint was that the room had some definite heat retention issues and the temperature was incredibly irregular. It took the heater quite a while to actually respond to the colder temperature in the room| and once triggered| the sound from the heater is overwhelming and impossible to ignore. So while I would recommend this hotel| I would also strongly suggest bringing some layers for your time in the room to compensate for the temperature issues.,1
Perfect location| friendly staffs| spacious room and comfy beds. Nothing to complain. I will probably come back here whenever I visit NY.,1
The location was terrific| staff were very helpful and the hotel was clean. The maintenance team had to come and swap out a thermostat in the room as the temperature could get too high at night despite a reading of 65 degrees. They were prompt but I am not sure that the original problem was fully solved. We had brunch in the restaurant one morning and it was a bit disappointing for the cost. The chef at the omelette station was good but the coffee that was served was not hot and fresh fruit was not all that fresh. It was a nice meal just a bit overpriced in my estimation. I would return to this hotel and would recommend it to others providing the per-night cost is competitive.,1
Convenient Location for business and leisure. Empire State building close proximity too.,1
It was all cleanly and good for the price. Not a large room| hotel is a bit old| but all we needed was a bed and a shower and this was a great price point. Location is fantastic. Customer service was somewhat awful - no one was particularly friendly| all seemed bored and fed up.,1
Small but sufficient room| had everything we needed for a week's stay as a couple. The location can't be beat| you are on Macy's doorstep with major subway routes| tourist attractions| restaurants and bars only a few minutes' walk away. This makes the location a little noisy 24/7 from the streets below| but to be expected when you're in such a prime location. Shower was a little slow to drain after each use| but otherwise amenities were modern and reliable. The room we stayed in did not have a main light on the ceiling| so we were often turning on every lamp/light source in the room to illuminate the space properly.,1
Great location| very easy to get to subway and walk to Broadway shows and Empire state. Great value room| however mattress was clearly a bit old as it sagged where others had slept,1
Great for catching shows at the Garden.,1
Location is great and property was clean but dated especially for the price.  Room was on the 31st floor and could hear the elevator going up and down all day and all night.  No room service available. No parking by hotel| only contracted parking.  Neither the Hilton front desk nor the contracted parking garge informed me that once your car is parked| and you leave| you must pay the max FULL day rate.  This cost me an extra $50 just to check in and off load the bags.  After some descusion the front desk agreed to take care of the parking fee due to the misunderstanding.  When the front desk asked how my stay was I said I couldnt sleep because of the elevator noise they just shrugged and asked how the rest of the stary was.  When I reviewed the invoice I saw the parking charge that was supposed to be removed.  I requested the adjustment for checkin parking be honored| they refused.  Will not be staying here again.,0
This hotel is convenient to Penn Station and Herald Square,1
The room and bath were a good size and clean. Laundry service was perfect. location of the hotel is great| close to many things.I would prefer firmer pillows| not the kind you sink in.,1
Treated us poorly cuz we booked through Expedia. Got a bad room.,0
In town for an event at MSG. great location| good up-to-date facilities| welcoming staff,1
The rooms are a little small but that is what you expect in NYC| but the most important part for us was location and this is perfect. It's blocks from Times Square and Grand Central| right next to Macy's| and has a Subway station outside the front door that is incredibly useful. Clean and good service too| plus our room had a beautiful view of the Empire State Building. Definitely recommend them.,1
Great location and spacious.Staff were very helpful and professional. We were very pleased during our stay.,1
Very clean and convenient locationSmall rooms but very nice overall,1
Pro: decent size room for NYC hotel. Microwave and fridge in the room. Great location and room was quiet.Just a note: the windows were not cleaned (on the inside - greasy marks)Con: Personally I didn't find that the bed was comfortable. It was making noise when moving around in it.No porter and no luggage carts were available when we arrived (maybe it was due to Christmas time)However| I would recommend this hotel| as it has more too offer than others at the same rate.,1
Amazing location and spectacular views of the Empire State Building from our room. The staff were fantastic!,1
Perfect area to stay‚Äînear Empire State Building| Herald Square| Macy's and good restaurants.,1
Family trip. Friendly service| comfortable room| great location! Parking around the corner for a fee. We will definitely return!!,1
This hotel is our favorite | we have stayed there at least 5 times and always are treated well | room was good and the amenities are always great ! I highly recommend this hotel,1
The manager helps us with our request to transfer our room from the lower level to the 25th floor.  It was a fabulous room overlooking 6th ave and 35th st where we had a good view of the Macy's parade.  Small but cozy|clean and helpful staff.  Thanks for a wonderful thanksgiving experience in New York.,1
Always a wonderful stay.  Staff is so courteous| great location and we never have a bad experience.,1
Service was good ‚Äî they kept our bags for us while we went to a show| then came back later and checked in. Room was quite small| even by NYC standards.,1
Awesome staff! George at the front desk was awesome.  He took care of us and made sure we had a good stay.  Our room was clean and hotel is in good location.  I will be sure to visit this hotel.  Thank you George and the staff at Hilton to ensure our stay was better than good!,1
Rooms are too small| elevators don't work| didn't clean our room until late in the day| restaurant over priced.,0
This was a great location to our stay. Everything was about 20 min cab or train ride.,1
Close to Herald Square !! Great location!! Close to Shake Shake !! Macy's!!,1
Location is really perfect for Time Sq and Broadway. The square out front of the hotel is ideal. Small rooms are no problem| just head down and snack/drink at the square and watch all the activity go by.,1
Great location close to shopping| restaurants and theater.,1
Great location| close to all the places we wanted to visit and subway station on corner.,1
Clean and nice. Team was very helpful,1
Great hotel very close to the Empire State Building| Broadway and Macy's.  Brilliant views of NYC from the higher floors.  Clean| comfortable room of a decent size.,1
Hilton Garden Inn New York on West 35th Street was ideal for what I was looking for.Staff were friendly and helpful.Room was clean and comfortable. I was on 6th floor so not much of a view| need to be on higher floors for that.Hotel location was central for many attractions and sightseeing,1
We stayed here for a week as a couple in September on our second visit to the City. Had no problems with the hotel| only the usual inconsiderate guests that decide to hold a lengthy conversation in the corridor outside our room late at night. (this seems to happen in every City hotel we stay in). Staff were friendly and efficient. Check in and out were painless. Had breakfast in the hotel on one occasion and couldn't fault it - plenty to eat/drink. Good service and clean. Had a lovely room with a large window to appreciate the city view we requested.  Rooms were spacious and bathrooms clean with plenty of hot water.,1
Very clean nice Hotel. Great location. Nice large room,1
Great location| comfortable room| good price| nice convenience food shop in lobby,1
Was a great experience. Checking was smooth quick and easy. They were also very accommodating storing our luggage the next day.  Would for sure stay here again.,1
Nice hotel and great location. Close to a lot of restaurants and shopping area,1
Fantastic location and within easy walking distance from Penn Station. City view room was perfect with really comfy bed.,1
Had a business assignment in midtown Manhattan for 2 weeks.  This hotel was 3 blocks from the office and near restaurants and Macy's. Worked out perfectly.  Comfortable| clean room and friendly staff.  Got a great rate too for NYC.,1
Very good location. close to time square and subway on door step. room and lobby was really tiny| one chair on table so 2 people can not sit on chair in room!  Have to sit on bed only. only bed side lamp/light in room| not enough.,1
Very happy with the Hilton. Version friendly and clean.,1
Small parks like Bryant| Tutor & the Highline were the best finds,1
Hotel location is very good for visiting the time square are.The breakfast could be better in terms of choices.,1
Great location| staff and room quality and cleanliness,1
Convenient location to stores| attractions and subway. A hop on and off bus is also 1 corner away. Very basic amenities.,1
Everything was just great from check in to check out..,1
Sadly the aircon unit made so much noise that sleeping a full night without being woken up several times is impossible| which defeats the purpose of staying in this hotel| since you want to be able to sleep.,0
The hotel is a convenient walking distance to Times Square| Central Park| the Empire State Building and Rockefeller Plaza.  We got to the hotel early and there wasn't a room ready yet so the clerk offered to hold our luggage while we explored the area.  Parking is in a garage on the next street behind the hotel.  All the staff was friendly and helpful| the beds were comfortable| and the shower was able to get very hot.  Excellent stay!,1
The location is good| near Macy's| Penn Station| and many restaurants. We stayed for a night.The room is spacious| but a bit old and dirty. There is a big flat TV| a microwave oven| and a small refrigerator|  but we did not use them. Free wifi is provided| but no USB charger in the room!,1
Great location| great condition| friendly staff,1
The location is very convenient. My room is on 30th flood. I love the view.,1
Nice hotel close to railway station with beautiful view.,1
Location was excellent for shopping| attractions  & restaurants. Room size was decent in NYC standard & was clean. Complementary water (no coffee or tea) supply was a joke. 4 nights stay| every night back at hotel 7-8pm| it was always empty or no cups. No ice machine anywhere!! It was 90¬∞F hot summer days. Even 2 stars hotels (most) have better service than this.,1
Perfect location to my office on Broadway btw 35th and 36th,1
This hotel has an amazing location| a couple of steps away from times square. Subwaystation right outside the hotel| and a lot of shopping|dining etc in the area. Friendly and very helpful staff made this a great experience. I would absolutely recommend this hotel.,1
Good location and comfortable room,1
I am overall  happy with  the stay at  the hotel.  Great location|,1
Everything was great. Only booked a room with view on the city and expected to be able to see the empire state building| but turned out to be a room at the other side of the building. Anyway still a good view from the 24th floor :-),1
"The room wasn't exactly ""newly renovated"" as I read somewhere but it was spacious by NYC standards| super clean| comfy beds| nice TV| fridge| great Keurig coffee machine|... Staff was great! Only issues were with the key cards and coffee refills but everything was solved quickly and not really a problem. Only had breakfast there on the last day. It wasn't very good but there were enough locations around the hotel to have a nice breakfast. Location was fantastic! I will definitely be back!",1
Christmas in New York is great,1
Excellent location in midtown,1
The larger rooms (by New York standards) and the gym were great features,1
Nice room| solid bed| lots of hot water. great selection of TV channels| great restaurant Herb 'n' Kitchen| friendly staff,1
The grab and go kitchen had hot food and good selection. Great for on the way to early am meetings.,1
I was very happy with my stay. The staff was wonderful!,1
The rooms were tiny| which can be understood given it is NY. However| they were so dry and dusty that we had issues simply sleeping for the entire stay. No amount of water or keeping the windows open spared us from the dry air.Aditionally| a magical charge of $68.86 showed up on my card and there was no one to contact. Customer service directed me to concierge who was never available. I even sent an email to the address they asked me to| and no response.Was it a good stay? Sure| it offered a bed and a decently clean room. Would I stay there again? Never.,0
Waiting 20 minutes to check in at 11:30 pm.  After waiting 30 minutes earlier in the day| only to be told that it would cost $55 to check in early.  Then another line and $5 more to leave one small piece of luggage.,0
I booked this specifically because it was dog friendly for larger dogs. No place for the dog to use the bathroom. Their answer was pee and poop on the sidewalk. Parking was a nightmare. No valet except once you're already in the garage. The room was falling apart and one of the most disappointing of our travels up the east coast for the cost. I booked the Hilton bc of their name and reputation. But I was very disappointed.,0
The room was excellent. However the food options were disappointing. I would have liked one full service restaurant.,1
Great location. Nice hotel amenities. Friendly and helpful staff,1
too much noise and limited services. i have been disappointed.,0
A couple Towels had some dirt on them| but most were clean,1
The only thing that would have made my stay better would have been having a coffee maker in the room.,1
I wish there was a coffee maker in the room and we would have liked more options for room service.,1
My husbend and I stayed at Hilton Midtown for 5 nights a week ago. Because it was relatively warm outside| hotel management decided to shut down whole heating system in the building. But the huge problem was that NOONE INFORMED us about that. Thinking that we put heating on high while went to bed| we slept under cold air coming out of the system.Of course I got sick| missed two meetings next day| travelled overseas in terrible condition with high fever and even now| after three days of arrival| I am on antibiotics. P.S. management did not even apologize| they just sent an extra blanket for me.,0
They wanted to charge $55 to check in three hours early. But $55?,1
The room Was available early. BUT charged me 55 dollars to get in room early.  I thought this was totally wrong.   No one was going to use the room until I got in| so why charge me to get in it.  Will not be staying here again if they don't comp me on this. And then another 34 dollars for resort fee?? Wow. Cost me 329 and 70 for parking to stay from 3pm until 12 the next day.  So overrated!!!!   400 a night| never again. Not worth it!  Off season! New Years and Christmas was over!,1
perfect located at the heart of manhattan| near and close of everything at Nyc,1
Excellent property| excellent location!! Always a favorite!!,1
The resort fee is charged| regardless of whether you use it or not.,1
My daughter and I stayed at the hotel over the Holidays (2019) and the hotel was extremely busy with so many tourists. We found that the hotel staff was patient and friendly| from check-in to our house keeper| taking care of so many people and their needs. We enjoyed our stay!!,1
Great double bed suite for the family and breakfast in executive lounge.,1
The only bad doesn't have coffee machine in the room,1
I was able to check in quickly| less than 5 minutes. The room was clean and hade enough towels. The food market seriously lacked in service. The register was unmanned for several minutes with 7 people in line.,1
I was say it was extremely frustrating because our keys kept failing to open our room.,0
This hotel is located in a great location! Perfect for me and my family of four.,1
Erratic replenishment of bathroom toiletries was the only irritant,1
Excellent location; we were able to walk to many places and had quick access to subway.,1
Waited in line for 45 minutes to check in. Only one of our rooms was ready. Paid for both and came back later to get keys for the second room. Had to wait another 35-40 minutes just to get the keys. They only had one person running the check in area and a huge line. Couldn't run the water in the bathroom sink for very long as it didn't drain. Toilet didn't work properly either. You could hear all outside noises from room all night.,0
The hotel was in the perfect location - close enough to Times Square but far enough to be away from the noise.  Short walk to the park or subway.  Hotel was very clean; nice bar & deli/store for quick bites and coffee.   Only real complaint is that the bathroom vanity space was little to none.  Would definitely stay here again.,1
Bathroom sink was clogged and it backed up with black gunk. Otherwise| property is lovely and in an ideal location,1
Nice rooms.. Good service!! Very accommodating.  Would definitely stay here again I'm the future.  Great location.,1
Overall good experience. For some reason my 3 nights stay was broken to 2 check-in.I had to come to the desk the second day to register again...,1
I truly enjoy staying here.  So close to so many things.  Great service.,1
I don't like to write reviews!  Our one night stay was just what we needed,1
Great location to see the Christmas sights. Right in the heart of the city,1
We PAID for WiFi| which didn't work| and the phone in the room also did not work| making it difficult to call to ask about the WiFi.  The room was warm and the temperature setting would only go down to 68 degrees.The roll-in shower's shower head pointed at the wall but was too high to move it if you were in a wheel chair. Even so| it was impossible not to soak the entire bathroom floor.The lightning in the room was poor.The curtains were on a push button system| which was a nice touch| but the buttons were relatively high on the wall| not easily accessible from a chair.,0
Absolutely NOT WORTH the star rating - probably will be a 2-3 star for what I can see.  This hotel has been around for ~20+ years.  Price was VERY HIGH for the quality of service you receive. We checked in around 11pm| was quick but lack manners. Upon entering the room| it smelt like sweat.  Horrible| but we were very tired after flying the entire day. Next morning we left for breakfast early and went site seeing. Came back shortly after and saw a housekeeping maid standing outside our room talking on a phone leaning against the wall. The worst thing was what appeared to be fresh clean towels ON THE FLOOR outside our door (see pictures).  What kind of person will put bath / hand towels ON PUBLIC FLOORS!!!!!!! Think about the germs / dirt / fungus etc that's been laying on the public floor and you wipe that onto your body?  Also the bed linens are very course / rough - feels cheap. Check out was bad too. We checked out early. The check out person at the front desk also had bad manners| I gave him the key cards told him my room number. He took the key card| rest by the keyboard and continued to work on other stuff for a minute| w/out saying anything| while looking elsewhere sometime.  No thank you| no nothing. period. First time staying here and will be our last!,0
Very good stay and location.  I will stay there again,1
My favorite affordable NYC hotel. Perfect location.,1
Everything was great. Enjoyed the happy hour & the breakfast.,1
Hotel is beautiful| very comfortable rooms. Bathroom could havw done with a better clean| ans needs updating,1
Good central location and nice size room which was comfortable. Noisy generators on our side of hotel with a constant background drone| even on 31st floor. Spent an hour in reception and would question security given some of the guests who appeared to be looking to simply get out of the cold and wet| possibly a Hilton approach to CSR. Generally an ok stay but probably won't be back.,1
There should be vending machines somewhere on the property| maybe near the lobby. On a cold snowy night the only way to get some food or a bottle of water is to get out of the hotel and walk and try to find a place that is open to get those items.,1
Great location and spacious room| especially for New York City.,1
The room was overbooked| took 3 different visits to the front desk to get it sorted| each front desk didn't even pass the proper messages to each other so I had to explain over and over again.  I would never book this hotel| ever again.,0
It's was very clean and customer service was great,1
Location and staff the property was clean I enjoyed the room layout as wellgreat for young families as well,1
Very nice overall| but could be a bit cleaner.  The staff is amazing at this location.,1
So convenient eating and shopping,1
Great location within walking distance to MoMA| shopping| restaurants. Bedding was super comfortable! I just wish there was a coffee maker in the room.,1
Good sized rooms| comfortable beds | friendly staff and good quality food on site if required.It is an excellent midtown hotel .,1
Location was the best! Room was spacious| friendly helpful staff. Price was good. I would stay again.,1
It's weird because it really all boils down to the noise level inside of my room. Outside of the other obvious reasons we choose our hotels| the one primary reason I book a hotel is to get a good nights sleep. With all of the banging| clanking| rushing sound| and other loud noises coming from above my head I could not sleep more than five minutes at a time.,0
We purposely booked a room that was billed as handicap accessible. Unfortunately| the roll-in shower was not properly designed and water flooded the bathroom floor every time we used the shower. We needed to put five or six towels down on the floor every time we use the shower to mop up all the water. The staff was very helpful with bringing  us towels as requested| but in my mind the room was just in adequate for handicap person.This is also the first major hotel that I've stayed in that did not have a mini fridge| a coffee maker| robes or room service. Because we were in New York City it was easy to use Seamless for food delivery| but I was disappointed that there was not in House room service available for us. I would not recommend this hotel| and would certainly not stay there again. The only plus was the friendliness of the staff. They were helpful| courteous and professional.,0
The property was not clean. It's really disappointing for that price. I had a great woman for the check in. Check out was done by a ridiculous man who didn't care about customer... staff need to be improved,0
Great location. Helpful staff. No coffee maker in room was surprising.,1
Staff like Kim and shantal were very helpful with me and my friend,1
The first day it was warm and the ac didn't work right.  The second night the weather was very cold and the heat didn't work right,0
I booked with Expedia a room with a bathtub| however| when I arrived I was told there are no rooms with a bathtub available and that I could ask to be moved the next day. I was given a room with a shower. The room looked old and smelled unpleasantly. The next day I was given a room with a bathtub| which was in much better condition than the first one. We went to the bar to use the hotel credit and we were not the only guests who noticed they were served something else than ordered. All together we consumed less than $60 of the credit we had| so I was told I was ok at the checkout. However| my credit card was charged on the day that I checked out $82.12. Now I am in the process of disputing that charge| that is not mine| through my bank.,0
Location and size of rooms are hard to beat in Central Park area.  Only downside was the lack of a coffeemaker in my room.  I requested one ahead of my stay but it wasn't provided.,1
I was suppost to get a room with 2 king sizes brds but| got 2 full sizes beds. This hotel doesn't have king size beds,0
Great nice and clean hotel!! Loved it,1
Pretty standard New York Mid Town business hotel. Have stayed here before and will do again.,1
No water in the rooms. Went to lobby and asked for water,1
Very friendly staff Love the professional service and the concierge desk.  Very amenable,1
Great location| friendly staff| nice place to stay.,1
The checking was without a hitch. Room and amenities were great. You are within walking distance of restaurants and entertainment.,1
Horrendous check in/ out process. Long lines| no one coming to help anyone but Hilton honors members. Elevators lines were a huge killer as wellBe aware of the resort fees!,0
great location| easy access. safe walking area any time of day,1
I was traveling with my 13-year-old daughter. The hotel is  well located and we were able to walk to most of the sites like Top of the Rock| Central Park and Time Square. The metro station was only a block away and was very safe to use. I would definitely recommend staying here.,1
Had a room with 2 doubles and 3 people.  Rooms are large enough to have queen beds| the double beds are too small.The breakfast buffet| while delicious and accessible for those of us with allergies was $140 for 3 people (no alcohol)Liked the black out curtains but the surge protector gave off a pretty bright night light| totally defeating the purpose of the black out curtains!,1
Fabulous location and property. However this hotel is used by at least one cruise ship per day causing long lines and extensive crowding at many times.,1
great location| excellent amenities in hotel...my only negative would be the $30 a day they lock you in to paying up front| to be credited back to you only if you use it at their food market and bars...seems a bit heavy handed to get you to spend more $$ at their facilities...,1
Really nice hotel | fun bar downstairs as well as restaurant,1
Easy check in clean with friendly staff great location,1
Great front desk| event if they did not have what I asked for.Overall hotel great if you like Las Vegas style size!Need some design update| 80's are over:)Not my kind of place| but everyone was great!,1
Very old and dirty hotel. Smells bad| bathroom very poor. Good location,0
Bathroom sink and floor had large cracks.  Needs major renovation.,0
Love the location of the hotel.. subway is close by  so you can disperse wherever you want .. so accesible location . Be aware no parking,1
Very central to everything...loved coffee shop inside lobby along with food options there...nice view of the city,1
Horrible service and staff. Didn't assist with any questions,0
The location is perfect! Very good and clean rooms.,1
Their air conditioner needs an upgrade. It was humid in the room.,1
The room was way over priced for what we paid for.The view was not of the city| The worst part we could not change the temp. in the room it was very cold. we were told the temp could not be changed till the hotel decided it was time.,0
The room was clean| The breakfast service was great.  Had a great time.  Would recommend the Hotel to a friend or relative.  I would go again to this Hotel.,1
I thought that the drinks were quite costly in the bar| but the staff was so extremely friendly and helpful| room was extremely clean and housekeeping staff kept it clean daily.,1
Great location and great staff... I also used the business center which was great...,1
good location; basic but clean and well maintained. Be aware of the extra hotel fees,1
We had the most unpleasant experience compared to other hotels we have stayed in New York| we had to change rooms three times during a 5 night stay because of hotel mistakes and because unprogrammed maintenance| we felt the rooms were dusty| one out of three elevators to our floor didn't work| and the fornt desk staff's servis was poor.  We received a one night refund in compensation for the inconveniences| I guess it is fair enough.,0
Staff was unfriendly and not helpful!The location is great!,1
It was clean.  There were problems with elevators which meant we had to wait a bit longer than planned.  Also| it would be nice to have complementary water or coffee to available in the rooms such as what is offered with other chains like Marriott,1
Great weekend with my wife.  We enjoyed the stay.  The room was clean and tidy.  No disappointments whatsoever.   I would recommend to a friend.,1
Not 1 complaint Great hotel very accommodating  !,1
Great location. Enjoyed the Herb'n Kitchen| though they were a bit understaffed in the Grab n Go area.,1
I liked how it was close to a lot of things in the middle of the city. I think the elevators were an issue since it took a long time to get one and they were usually crammed. Also I recommend letting guests know they get a $30 credit to their room every day.,1
Close to everything walking distance. Nice big open lobby area,1
Liked: locationDisleked: no personel to make you feel welcome at entries| across the lobby area,1
Location was perfect. Request for quiet room for the baby's sleep was well accommodated.,1
Great location and Hotel. Close to shopping . Safe location.Always stay here .,1
Great hotel and location. Everyone professional . Great shopping!,1
The Hilton Midtown is a fantastic facility in just the right location. Super comfortable rooms and amenities.,1
The room we are in is small and not comfortable | don't wait and say something I learned my lesson,0
Perfect location. Did not like the mandatory $30 fee (even with the inclusions),1
The staff were friendly and had a good sense of humour. They were always willing to help with whatever we needed. The room was big for NY standards and clean. It was great having the Herb n kitchen in the hotel as we could get fresh fruit or snacks or meals whenever we wanted. I would definitely stay here again.,1
Property is nice and well located| but you'll be nickel and dimed for breathing. And don't even think about asking questions at the front desk‚ÄîI actually said at one point| ‚Äúwell| we'll just keep trying until we get someone who's nice enough to talk to us.‚Äù Not all staff are unkind| but it was enough of a pattern that it made paying a premium price for everything very hard to swallow.,0
Check in had extra fees that were rudely explained. The female bartender was incredible and very friendly. There was no fitted sheet on the bed so the regular sheet kept moving meaning that I was touching the yucky mattress pad most of the night. Check out was supposed to be at 12:00 and a staff member let him/herself into our room at 9:15 and woke us up. Good sized room. Cheap toilet paper. Fast Wifi.,0
Nice hotel but stuff never explains anything and room was an clean,0
Well it started off not so great by us getting a room that was already being occupied. Someone's belongings were in the room and the room was not fully cleaned. At first the hotel wanted to grab the persons items and have us keep the room. No! We need another room. Due to having the room issue my friend and I missed our event. Other than offering a new room the hotel did nothing for us. I'm not one to cause a scene or overreact when this type of thing happens. But something woild've been nice. We could not get a refund for our event because it was too close to the time for the event and 24 hours is needed. If we knew beforehand we would miss the activity we would've canceled. There's $52 we didn't and won't get back. Other than that the staff is very nice and professional. The hotel and new room we stayed in was very nice. They kept it clean.,1
Very clean room good price very comfortable beds very friendly staff,1
Nothing| the people are rude| the room smells| there are bugs and I can't wait to leave.,0
The lights in the room are cheap and the bulbs too bright. The water pressure is ok| but not great.The bigger issue is that I made 2 separate bookings as I initially was staying 1 night| but changed to 2.After attending meetings all day| I come back at 9:30pm to find my room had not been serviced. Very disappointing,1
I expected more from Hilton New York... needs renovation.,0
no good food later in the evening| need to go out of hotel,1
Very good customer services. I left my dress in the closet and called them when I was back home. Staff at lost and found is very helpful and send my dress to my home right away.,1
location was great| but amenities were very poor; no coffee machine| no refrigerator| old towels!  dust everywhere in the room! guest services was not friendly.,0
Great location and good rooms. Prompt customer service,1
A great stay in NYC. Fabulous location| excellent service| huge room for NYC! We arrived early on check in day and were able to get right in to our room. I had booked one king bed and the gentleman that checked us in asked if we'd prefer two beds- which we did. The room was spacious| clean| and nicely updated. The TV was huge! Housekeepers super friendly and always saying hi and smiling. Only complaint- the WiFi was weird. I kept getting kicked off even after entering the password. Herb and kitchen (grab and go cafe) had just about anything you could need! Snacks| drinks| hot food| etc etc. Would definitely come back to this hotel next time I travel to NYC!,1
Customer service was great !!!!! But than we arrived in the room and it smelled like a basement. Also we had a room for 6 and there were only 3 towels. We had no cups/glasses. So besides the room our stay was great| the location was awesome!!!!,0
Great location and exactly what you expect -no surprises!,1
Great location| walking distance to Radio City| Rockefeller| Time Square and Subway Stations. Rooms are roomy and clean,1
The Midtown Hilton is in a perfect location!  Walking distance to Central Park| Rockefeller Center| Time Square| museums| theaters and Broadway.  It's accommodations are wonderful and staff incredible!   I've stayed numerous times and would definitely recommend it as a great place to stay in NY!,1
Excellent hotel - elegant and clean. Amazing breakfast. Centrally located. Parking is expensive| though. Not a problem if you don't have a car| but we had one.,1
Very nice hotel| parking fees are outrageous but other than that enjoyed our stay,1
Didn't like having to pay 30.00 extra per night for credit to bar and eating place,1
Black out for hours when power was restored elevators were not working and we were told that no stairs were available just a nightmare,0
Everything else all met our expectations| even though we encountered the blackout.,1
I checked in at 12:15am then had to wait 45 minutes for a room to get cleaned !!,0
Power outage in hotel. No refund was given. No contact by hotel was made afterwards to us as guests.,0
As always| a very good stay. Keep up the good work!,1
Great location| nice rooms| friendly staff. The luggage storage is a bit of a walk from the check in area| and for a 4 star hotel I was a bit surprised our bags weren't taken care of and brought to the room once it was ready for us. The breakfast buffet is nice| and check out was easy. Overall a good hotel| but the services offered could be spruced up| especially for the cost.,1
Didn't like the 30.00 charge on the room each night for snacks and food. Basically we were forced to purchase food we didn't want,1
Amazing location! Within walking distance to so many places!,1
Great location. Staff was friendly. We were only given two towels each night even though the room was booked for four people. Just a minor inconvenience having to ask for extra towels each night,1
Nice building| xpensive parking| not enough toiletries.,1
Loved the location and the proximity to all the sites.,1
Our stay at the Hilton Midtown was great. Everyone was very friendly| helpful and accommodating. We were met with smiles all around. When the concierge found out it was my daughter's 25th birthday she had a bottle of wine and dessert sent to her room. My husband and I want to go back for our anniversary. It's a great location. Only thing I was a little disappointed in was the view from our room.,1
Very spacious rooms| nice lobby area was nice and large and hotel is located in a great location.,1
Dirty. Ice bucket had maxi pads in it.  I called and requested a new bucket and someone came to the door and dumped out the pads and just put in a new liner. Gross,0
The room was spacious| very nice| the lobby was entertaining and wonderful| entrance was very beautiful and elegant. What I didn't like was the bathroom towel was dirty| I found brown stains on the new folded towel so I had to call housekeeping for new ones| the phone didn't work properly to contact the front desk so I used my cell phone| the check in front desk was very busy and crowded| took a very long time to both check in and check out of the hotel| wasn't very satisfied. The hotel location was great.,1
Our stay was amazing!  The food and location were perfect.  The only thing that was wrong is the AC kept messing up.,1
It was very convenient and centrally locates. Staff was friendly,1
We found this hotel at 3:00am since we were left stranded at our original hotel booking with lack of air conditioning.  Thanks to Mouctar at the front desk| he accommodated us and made the start of our trip better than it originally began.,1
It was a really nice hotel! My family and I really enjoyed our stay!,1
Loved staying at this beautiful hotel. My son and I loved the food| staff| and location.,1
The location was amazing. The staff were extremely professional and helpful. Room was spacious and clean.,1
They did not let me check in | said there is no room then move me to another hotel.,0
No coffee or bottled water in the rooms.   Other than that everything was excellent.,1
Awesome facility and location!!  Bob at the front desk was very nice!!,1
I personally would not book here again. This has to be by far the worst Hilton I have ever been to.,0
The staff was not forthcoming with pricing.   From the food to the parking the staff made it appear every thing was taken care of upon check in.   Imagine my surprise when the staff stated we had to put down $150 deposit and the only money returned was $34.    During our stay we ‚Äúreceived a food credit‚Äù.   The only food we had at your restaurant was  1 cup of coffee| a croissant  and a bagel.   Upon getting our car we were given a bill for $140.   I do not appreciate being what it amounts to is lied to.,0
Great location in Manhattan. Very nice staff. Very expensive for water inside the hotel though. $9 for a 32 ounce bottle of water at Herbs cafe. Gio who worked at front desk was extremely helpful with accommodations and keeping us in same room. I would certainly return to this hotel.,1
Breakfast was excellent value. Considerable choice for both hot/cold breakfast. $48 for American breakfast (hot &cold) choices or ¬£28 for cold breakfast.One downside is the $30 daily charge for on-site amenities  etc.| whether you use them or not.,1
The property was clean and safe. The staff was very friendly!,1
Nice room. Place to hold bags. Large breakfast buffet. Didn't tell us at check in that we had $30 to spend at Herb and Dine until we were ready to check out.,1
Everything Was great except the 1st night. When I checked in at 4:30PM they said they were sold out of rooms and only put me in a room that was the size of a closet. I prepaid $2500 6 weeks ago. Why wasn't a room held for me. I stayed there many times and have always been pleased. I had to move the next afternoon which messed up my day. Pack and unpack double times. Many people I noticed checked after me and they seemed to get their rooms.,1
Liked location| didn't like no fan in the bathroom,1
Room and property need updating. Stains on couches. Coffee table in living room was filthy. When I asked for pull out to be made| staff seemed annoyed to have to make the bed. When he opened up the pullout| sheets and blanket from previous guest was still on the pull out. He pulled all the sheets off the bed| then left it in a pile outside the room - I had to request the front desk to have it removed an hour later. Not a bad property| given the enormous size| but it definitely needs a facelift - especially a thorough cleaning.,1
Hotel is pretty shabby condition. Musty smell| trim falling off wall. Caulking holding everything together.,0
Fantastic location walking distance to central park to get away from the hustle and bustle and walking distance to time square.the tube station is just behind the hotel to take you straight to world trade centre.The hotel fantastic a bit  pricey for some stuff but hey it is New York |would stay there again,1
Extremely outdated| especially for the price. You're paying for the name ( which is not even great ) but this hotel is nothing special. It's crowded| dirty and old. Let's just say... you're a needle in a haystack at this hotel. This hotel should be no more than 150$. I can't believe I spent more than double that.,0
Computer problem at check in| took us 45mins to get to the room. Room is clean| beds are just a small full size; I understand the price issues but they should have equipped with queen size beds since they have enough space. A nice restaurant in property would be useful when it rain and people don't want to get out.,1
The food in their market was expensive and you didn't get much for your money.,1
hotel is excellent| overall condition| cleanliness| location very convenient| service very good. No complaints. Will come back,1
The location of the hotel is ideal for exploring all areas of NYC. It is a large hotel and most likely caters to business travelers; no boutique feeling here. The lobby is modern| welcoming| and the staff are friendly and helpful. The room had some updates (paint| wallpaper| headboard| comfortable bed) which were nice| but new carpet is in order. The bathroom was quite small and could use an update. The breakfast buffet is excellent and offers something for everyone. Overall I would recommend the hotel and I would not hesitate to stay there again.,1
Location was terrific close to everything. We're able to walk to most attractions.Wish there had been better lighting in the room. Otherwise| no complaints.,1
The breakfast buffet at herb n kitchen was excellent and delicious. The omelette station George is excellent| so courteous and helpful. He deserves recognition for going above and beyond to serve his customers. George has definitely made our experience at Hilton memorable and enjoyable!,1
Amazing location. Walking distance to everything. Kind staff. Decent room| though lacked fridge and coffee which seems pretty much the norm these days. Fast elevators.,1
Great stay.located walking distance to the main sights.friendly staff.easy check in and out.,1
Our booked room was not available once we arrived. I booked an accessible room for my father and it was not available| even though I booked 3 months in advance. We were given a temporary room in which we had to make our own bed.,0
Great location| walking distance to a lot of attractions| check in was very quick| the room was as described and a bit larger than expected - executive suite. We found the arrangement of lamps/lighting a bit odd. There was some trash left under the sofa by a previous guest but overall very clean and cleaned daily. Breakfast 5 times out of six had plenty of food available| one day we arrived late at 10am and there was little choice left mainly cold food even though they serve until 11am. Breakfast staff were excellent| food good quality although if it hadn't been included in the room rate I wouldn't have paid the 38.95 they were asking to pay on the door| far too much! and 5 dollars each for storing our suitcases for a couple of hours was extortionate. In places the hotel feels a little bit in need of a spruce up but considering the size and number of rooms that's not surprising. Overall we were happy with our choice of the Hilton Midtown,1
Comfortable room of reasonable NYC size.  Ideal location: close to Broadway| Central Park and numerous restaurants.  Good| efficient service and friendly front desk.,1
Beautiful property with all the amenities you need. Very quiet.,1
As| usual awesome stay| fantastic location!!!,1
I would never stay at thus Hilton again. The hotel staff was extremely unapproachable and basically rude. There was no coffee pot in the room and they also charged 5 a bag to hold luggage. Very disappointed for the price we paid.,0
The staff was sweet and helpful. The room was great. Excellent location.,1
Location is good| area is safe| Breakfast was fantastic| room size was good  a coffee machine in room would have been nice,1
Everything about this property leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Service is absolutely nonexistent. They charged $55.00 extra if you arrive before 3:00pm to check in. They charge $30.00 per day extra for no reason at all --- which is illegal. They don't honor your Hilton Honors status at all. They open your room door without even knocking. They have no umbrellas when it rains. They don't offer free water in the room even tho Hilton is supposed to. Everything was quite terrible.,0
Old| dirty and expensive. I didn't like that they charge you 5 dollars per bag to leave them for a few hours and on top of that they only take cash. They also have the nerve to say that tip is not included.,0
It would have been nice to have a coffee maker in the room.,1
It was amazing what I found in my room when I checked in. A beer on the night stand| dirty towels in the bathroom| and room keys on the desk. I went to the front desk an hour after requesting the room be cleaned and no one appearing. The second room offered wasn't much better. Chip bags behind the dresser. It was very disappointing.,0
Happy with all except fee for luggage storage.Beds comfy.Rooms clean.,1
The view was perfect.Breakfast was a bit disappointing: no cheese| no sausage| no omelet etc,1
I loved how close it was to all the great things for a tourist in NYC,1
I loved the location! The staff was friendly| and the rooms were clean and spacious. I would recommend this hotel and I will definitely be coming here for my future trips. Thank you for the wonderful stay!,1
Not a big fan of the $30 resort fee.,1
My room was very clean| very nice| and large compared to other NYC hotel rooms.  The hotel was centrally located| and there was no shortage of taxis out front!,1
Great place for a weekend family trip to NYC. If you disregard the incompetent staff of Herbs & Kitchen food counter in lobby| the place is perfect.,1
very nice and good surprise,1
Amazing experience had a great time thanks for the service bus boys where great,1
Need free wifi. Staff very friendly. Good location,1
Beautiful decor| great food and beverage choices| comfy beds and baths.,1
Hotel was nice| rooms were large.   I only have two complaints. The air conditioning never got the room really cool and the breakfast buffet was $48 which is crazy!   Location was close to a lot of places.,1
Great view| AC did not work. Best location in Manhattan,1
Well located| comfortable rooms| a bit impersonal and limited eating options| but fine overall,1
We had a wonderful stay. Great location,1
Conveniently located near all major attractions and near the subway as well. Room was clean| and staff were friendly and helpful.,1
Perfect location| easy access to everything. Room was clean with comfortable bed and awesome pillows. I was happy to be able to store the luggage for few hours after check out| before taking shuttle to the airport.,1
Property in terrible condition| like stepping back into the 1960s,0
Great location and great overall property but I didn't appreciate the early check in fee and the amenities fee.,1
Great place to stay ..............................,1
The location is great for a New York experience. The staff was very helpful when I suddenly needed to print tickets to a show that did not allow digital tix. A coffee pot in the room and wi-fi range were the only two things I'd like to see improved.,1
How close it was to everything in nyc and how friendly the staff was,1
Everything was perfect!,1
Great hotel| great location| safe| clean.  Made our trip to NYC amazing because it was so convenient to stay there!,1
Nice location| central location makes it convenient to everything.,1
Tremendous location! Right at the heart of everything,1
Stay in the exec suite- very nice! The staff was friendly and helpful.,1
Very close to all attractions.  Walking distance to everything,1
Great location! Close to many sightseeing destinations! Awesome hotel credits provided,1
Location excellent very nice places st the lobby clean room,1
Property was excellent and the area looked safe. Staff tho|  were not so accomodating.,1
The location was excellent - close to theaters| Central Park| and subway stations.  We did hear some street noise but never hotel noise.  The room was actually larger than I expected| plenty of space for the 4 of us.,1
The hotel was in an excellent location| very close to many places of interest,1
Perfect location for midtown NYC. Rooms were good sized for New York.,1
Great location| clean and quiet  on 34th floor| very comfortable bed,1
Great location - central to all the places and things we wanted to see and do.,1
I enjoyed staying at this property.  Very clean| nice sized rooms| centrally located with access to major venues.,1
This hotel has great location| clean room and friendly valet staff.,1
Service and staff friendly and clean! Nice and the beds were comfy we will stay again,1
Great location. Just a few blocks from Times Square and Broadway. Felt incredibly safe where we were. Comfortable beds. Friendly staff. Food and beverage items were a little overpriced| but I found that to be true of New York in general.,1
Beautiful hotel| clean rooms. VERY busy - the lobby always had a ton of people in it. Don't expect any free amenities - no coffee maker in the rooms| free wifi only for Hilton Honors members (which we are| so I'm not sure how much it cost). $50 charge to check in early. The Lobby Lounge downstairs is quite pricey - we paid $55 for two burgers and an iced tea| though the burgers were delicious.,1
Upon arriving we checked in. The lobby is very nice| so that's always a good sign. We checked in and the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable. It was late and we were in need of something quick to eat| so they made a few good recommendations. The rooms here clean and very spacious for NYC. Everything seemed to be (somewhat) recently updated. Beds are very comfortable. TVs are newer and they provide premium channels which is always a plus. Bathrooms are nothing special| but still very nice. As far as other amenities go| they have a great little place for coffee/breakfast/snacks called Herb N' Kitchen. They also have a couple of bars to grab a bite or some drinks. Being in the heart of midtown there are plenty of nearby options as well.,1
Great location and easy access to the hotel.  Very clean and well maintained,1
Great hotel with quiet rooms and perfect night sleeps.,1
The location and the premises of the hotel are perfect. However| the open buffet breakfast despite being very generous and having wide selection tastes and feels horrible.,1
I didn't like being charged $25 charge everyday for the bar or lounge.,1
Amazing location. Superb service from Lek with the concierge desk.,1
It has given me many great Memories .,1
It's a good place for business travel.  You can eat and drink in the hotel| its quite| and in a great location. There is a business and shipping center which is a big hep for me.  The rooms are clean| but didn't have a coffee maker.  The bar is open late enough to get a glass of wine before bed and they have amazingly addictive bar nuts.,1
This is a large| busy hotel. The location of is perfect| a short walk to almost everything! The room was clean| large (for NYC standards!) and comfortable. The service was very good. The breakfast buffet is excellent| and the bar and cafe (coffee|beer| wine| drinks| snakes and simple meals) very handy. We enjoyed the stay very much. I am going back in a few months with two friends and will stay here on that trip as well.,1
I had here for family trip. It's very convenient to anywhere. But it's noisy anytime.  I recommend you for trip or business.,1
We happened to be there at the same time as 100's of students from all over the world which made it a bit loud| busy and overcrowded.  Would have been nice to know that was going on prior to our booking.Other than that our stay was good.Sheldon Satterthwaite,1
Room could have benefited from a refresh... nothing too bad,1
sink was extremely small and the makeup mirror was so low that you had to put your face in the sink to see in the makeup mirror....don't know what they were thinking to put the mirror in that location....rooms could be updated a bit...,1
Good hotel in a great location.  Rooms are large for NYC| lovely bright lobby with busy atmosphere| bars and casual eateries in hotel were nice.,1
Great location few blocks from time square. Easy access to subway in multiple directions. Late night sit down food is a couple blocks away but they do have some food stands across the street.,1
Couldn't fault this hotel have stayed there so many times and it never fails to live up to expectations. Our concierge was so helpful her name is Lek. And at checkout the lady  at checkout joyland. Couldn't have asked for better 5stars from me thanks,1
Amazing location - within awalking distance from many tu| friendly staff.,1
The location is great. The fact that I did not earn Hilton Honors points for this stay Because it was through Travelocity I found to be very disappointing. Also I was not able to use the two credits that were mandatory and missed out on approximately $70.,1
It was a great  location    The staff was very helpful when asked for recommendations or best way to get somewhere    It had easy acces to subway and bus tours.,1
I should not have been charged a daily $25 amenity fee. Never have been charged before. Booked a queen size bed & received a smaller bed & room was much smaller than past. Probably will not return Thank You Ed Evanoff,0
Was not happy with mandatory $25 /per night ‚Äúurban destination fee‚Äù that was added on.  This should have just been added to the nightly room rate since we did not have a choice. This was not one of the taxes cities impose but rather a hotel charge,1
The view was great| and the location was convenient! No complaints.,1
This was in a great location. Easy to walk to Times Square and other attractions. Room was clean and spacious!,1
Hotel good front desk charges twice doble under investigation,1
I had great time,1
Spacious corner room. Cleaning staff in hallway were very friendly.,1
This hotel continually disappoints. After multiple stays. No iron in room and took almost 45 minutes to get one. No coffee make in room for a quick cup in the morning (even La Quinta's give you a cheap cup in the room). Too crowded downstairs in cafe to quickly get anything (as they herd everyone there).Simply not impressed.,0
Great location| amazing beds and pillows. Beautiful| luxury lobby. What you'd expect in NYC!,1
Nice rooms| don't like the resort fee for i didn't get my monies worth,1
Nice hotel staff was very welcoming & the room was ready early. Room was very clean,1
Friendly staff| clean room. Convenient for conference.,1
Good location....nice size room....clean and updated,1
Great stay. Room was spacious for a NYC king. Definitely pay the fee for the free breakfast. It's an unimaginable feast!,1
Great location| you walk to most popular locations. We would definitely stay there again.,1
I booked a room here for convenience because I was attending an event at the hotel that night.  Upon arrival they checked me into a room that was already occupied and getting it resolved cost me all the time that I had planned to get ready for the black tie event and I was actually late to the party because of their incompetence.  The managers took too long to resolve the situation and they did not even express any apology or concern that they ruined the start of my evening.  For what it cost me including overnight parking they should be ashamed.  I did not even receive a courtesy call or follow up from them.,0
The property is centrally located and close to most NY venues.  Friendly staff; excellent breakfast buffet.Would have liked to have a coffee maker in the room.,1
The room itself was basic| and a bit tired. Great location and great amenities within the hotel. I'd go back.,1
Our suite was quite large| which is unusual in New York. The decor is extremely dated. The continental breakfast at the Executive Dining Room was the worst I've ever experienced. Even cheap hotels do better. Really a disgrace.,0
Unacceptable| rude staff members| not willing to help you|,0
Stayed two days in early January.  Urban King room was nice size with nice view.  Rate on expedia was excellent.  Previous week was twice as much.  Check-in person was especially pleasant.  Check-out line in morning was way too long.  Need to put more people on at checkout time.  Hotel location is excellent to everything... right in the heart of midtown.  Easy to get to Broadway shows| restaurants| etc...Would definitely stay there again,1
I loved the location. It's close to everything that a first time visitor needs to see. The only thing I didn't like is that they charge $5 a bag to hold your luggage after the check out.,1
Overall the hotel was fine. The bed was uncomfortable and the sheets were like an sos pad.,1
I always choose Hilton However this time I made the wrong decision.  Staff was very rude and Ingot charge for an early check in I have never heard of that. I am a travel agent and I will not be recommending this place to my clients.,0
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Hilton Midtown in Manhattan. The hotel was clean and comfortable. It is in a great location that is close to everything. Value wise I think it is well worth it. Highly recommended.,1
Staff is very nice and helpful.location is great.they have bar|kitchen and club inside the hotel.It was very clean overall.The security system is really nice.The photo booth located in front is really nice.,1
Over all my stay was great.. great staff and amineties. But|  I wished that the check in proccess was not so chaotic| and the long lines and wait time improved. Granted it was during New year's week.. but then it should have been better.  Also did not like the fact the bag check was not free for hotel guests.,1
We decided to take a trip to NYC a few days before New Years.  We expected it to be busy and it was!!  BUT| the Hilton Midtown did everything in their power to accommodate the hoards of people who were showing up.  We waited in a bit of a line to check in but they walked around with bottled water for everyone.  We also waited in a line for breakfast| but they were so friendly and accommodating to our large group (7 people).  The breakfast was great!  The stay was great!  The room d√©cor could be improved but it was still comfortable.  The staff was friendly and I can't say anything bad.  They did their best given the circumstances (NYE in NYC!).... Thanks Hilton!,1
This property has no idea how to mange the large volume of guests. Check-in was over an hour even though we are Hilton rewards members and should have been able to check-in with our phone. The reasoning as to why it took so long was that staff was on break. I am certainly all about staff taking a break but when check-in is at 3pm| why in the world would you not send them all before that.  Despite telling us over and over that it was the busiest week out of the year| they ran out of everything and handled staffing in ways that made no sense.To be fair| the staff ( servers and housekeeping) worked hard. Out of 5 days our room stayed dirty one day until it was time to go back to sleep. We found popcorn and other food items on the floor in our room - which were items we never ate. So don't feel the room was cleaned very well.,0
need to have a restaurant to have dinner as guests,1
Magnificient buildings and very clean streets. The place was just so busy and crazy.,1
The location was great. rooms small no coffee maker in room. There is no way to check in early or they charge you. when I booked the room it was advertised that breakfast was included but no one new anything about that when we arrived.,0
"However| once I got to check-out| in addition to apologizing immediately for the wait| the clerk also cancelled out the ""Resort fee"" of $25 per day as well as an additional $25 on my bill from the restaurant. That made a total savings of $75. I was totally appeased.",1
Cleaning lady was very rude she was misbehaving with us,1
Convenient and very nice.  Price was good for NYC and a Hilton Hotel,1
Very nice property| excellent location| very close to central park.,1
We had to wait 3 hours for them to come and make our pull out couch.  Also| our iron wasn't working,0
Rooms were tiny. No ac| and heat was stuck on. Tv was terrible. Place was an absolute packed madhouse and staff were always rude.,0
Long waiting to check in/out.  Booking thru Hotel.com. being punished for $100 surcharge! and not honor for Hilton points.  The organization might as well not participate in outside Sals Programs. Microwave in the room for $35 extra!,1
No coffee in the rooms and a 30 minute wait to get coffee in the lobby.  Beds were small and room was very small.,0
Nice hotel ubication| only a couple blocks from Rockefeller Center and Times Square.,1
We checked in Christmas Day and when we arrived the line was almost out the door and there were 2 clerks checking people in.  We had lunch and tried again but the line was just as long| but fortunately they had more clerks.  We were there 3 days and saw this same line everyday.  The rooms are spacious and the location is excellenr.  The bar had no Ginger Beer to make Moscow Mules which seems strange since it's such a popular drink.  They also had no regular olives for my martini| only Bleu Chrese and the bartender put them in my drink without asking me.  The coffee is great there but the line each morning when we woke up was at least 15 minutes to get coffee.,1
Convenient and close to a lot of shopping and food,1
Good location. We had a corner room on the 23rd floor with lovely view through the skyscrapers to Central Park.,1
Excellent location near to Time Square| MOMA and Rockefeller Centee (walking distance). Room clean and comfortable.,1
Location is the best I've stayed at in nyc Had everything I needed    Staff very accommodating. Right by Radio City Music Hall| Rockefeller center| Central Park| and Time Square.,1
Nice Hotel. I will recommend to my all friends. Amazing location and food. Hotel staff is amazing,1
The hotel check in took more than an hour. They didn't have enough personnel for the amount of guests. Tables at the bars were absolutely dirty| empty cups all around| the Executive Lounge had the soda machine broken| coffee machines broken. In simple words: too many guests with an improper amount of staff members.,0
"Great location.  Cleean rooms| very friendly staff| awful management.  Terrible check in/out procedures.  Lines hours long| no answer on customer service phone.|  TV check bill/ check out procedure not working|  ""free internt but $1.00/minute to us business center.  Very confusing $25 per night bar/restraunt credit badly designed.  Hard to believe it is really a Hilton.",0
very nice but checkin line was long........................,1
Location super near shopping| entertainment | easy moving,1
Great location and very nice room. Size was much better than expected. Would definitely stay there again.,1
Loved the location| was close to lots of restaurants and time square and rockerfeller center were all within walking distance.,1
Excellent ubication| cleanless| comfort Antonio the staff,1
King Premium Skyline View Room with breakfast had an amazing view| really good breakfast and clean. Check in was long but expected with Christmas being the following day but Overall experience was great. Was celebrating a birthdays and all top notch restaurants minutes away and Times Square is walking distance.,1
Great location. Comfortable. Memory foam sofa bed kept our kids from complaining about an uncomfortable bed.,1
We tried to check in at 3:05.  Our room was not available but they said we could downgrade.  We opted to wait and come back in 2 hours.  We wanted use the hotel credits we paid for on a late lunch and drinks but because we did not have a room we could not charge them to a room. So we couldn't use the credit we are forced to but.  We can back at 5:30 and were given room keys and told they could see what they could do about the charges.  Nothing has happened at this point to those charges a couple days later. We got to our room and the keys didn't work.  Came back and stood in the holiday lines which we expected for a third time to find we were given the wrong room number.  We finally got to our room running late to get ready for Our Reservation to find not enough room towels. We made it work with  what we had.  We called 2 different times for towels and never received them.  I ended up going and finding housekeeping in a hallway and got 2 towels. In edition to all that the service in the bar and food areas was extremely slow and at times felt ignored. I am disappointed because I am a fan of Hilton as a whole but this experience was disappointing.,0
Hotel was clean| excellent location| great service. Room was clean and comfortable.,1
We stayed in the executive suite and despite having executive suite privileges| out keycard didn't allow us card access to these areas for the whole four days; instead we had to rely on staff being on duty at these places.Hotel was in the centre of everything| a short walk to Times Square in one direction and Central Park in the other. Despite the rain| it was easy to make our way around New York and still take tours because of the jitel's central location.,1
Perfect place to go if you want to be within walking distance to Broadway| Central Park| Rockefeller Center| Times Square (which is basically Broadway)| and everything else that you could want to do. Highly recommend| especially with great staff and perks like credits for drinks and purchases at their in house snack store.,1
Great location| excellent service. Dedicated staff| close to everything.,1
Perfect location and great price for what you get.  The rooms were large clean and comfortable.  The breakfast was spectacular.  The parking option was extremely expensive,1
It is a great location| with in a 5 minute walk to Radio City Music Hall,1
This hotel is the perfect location to walk to Rockefeller Center| Times Square| Radio City| and great shopping. Staff was so helpful and breakfast was delicious. Valet service also very easy to use...we did up and down service when we needed to check out but weren't ready to leave the city. The valet brought down the vehicle| loaded our bags| then took it back into the garage.,1
The registration service was excellent. They accommodated any request with prompt and courteous service,1
It took 40 minutes to check in on arrivalFor 600/night I expect a better room and breakfast service. Staff was not especially friendly or helpful.,0
Very convenient location and check in was very prompt.,1
The wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling apart at the seams. At almost$500 per night| I was surprised at this.,1
Nice location. Moderate price for Manhattan,1
Great location and good amenities.  Super crowded for holiday weekend| but that is to be expected.,1
Excellent place to stay in Mid Town Manhattan! Quite a central location for business as well as for quality entertainment,1
Location of hotel is really perfect. Room was big for NY Standards but cost per night was outrageous for just a standard room. WiFi did not work.,1
We had a great stay at the Hilton Midtown!  Took my teenage girls into the city for a girls weekend.  The hotel was clean| great location and the staff was excellent.  My expedia deal came with free breakfast| which was great - big buffet with all the fixin's.  I will definitely stay here again!,1
excellent location staff was terrificgrab and go amenities a nice touch,1
Nice sized rooms| comfortable beds | great location !!,1
lots of food and drink option right in hotel and plenty of space to relax with friends.,1
I love everything about this place. The only problem was they didn't have enough stuff members to help out with checking in and checking out. We had to stand in line to just get our room keys| we have checked in in the morning but rooms were not ready and when we came back around 4:00 we had to stand in the same line that people who were checking in. That could manage that differently| they also didn't aware us about discount for restaurant that we were in title for staying in the hotel.,1
Tiny| awkward room for $500 a night. Staff was rude. Mini queen bed. Eill never stay here again on business.,0
Convenient location. Close to everything. The only complaint is that The towels were a little hard.,1
I love Hilton hotels good experience with the benefits and services and friendly staffs,1
First and foremost| we had an amazing time staying out your Hotel. Mei at the front desk was the best! The only suggestions I will give you is if you are going to have a refrigerator in the rooms- you should always have a microwave in the same room. We needed a microwave and didn't have one to heat up our leftovers. Another suggestion - the bathroom downstairs near the luggage storage was used as a changing room. I stood in a line for 10 minutes to use the bathroom. After entering the bathroom - I saw young college students using the restroom only to change. They took up the stalls for this and that wasn't fair. You should make 1 stall for changing or post a note stating that they have to use another facility for that.,1
very nice and classy| and close to everything!We loved our stay there.,1
Overall good! Great location and comfy room| however| you can hear the elevators in the room which is a bit annoying.,1
Thank you |it was very nice |good work|selection|and rates,1
Room was small but comfortable for three adults traveling with a baby. The hotel nickels and dimes for a lot of stuff though - sign up for the Hilton Honors loyalty program to get around some of this.,1
For such a big hotel this was a good one.  The AC was not obnoxious and the hotel was modern| clean and comfortable.,1
Nice hotel in convenient location.  Easy to get to plays and restaurants.,1
Deli food options in lobby area open till midnight. This gives opportunity for healthy food late at night without sitting in a restaurant,1
This is an expensive hotel but you get what you pay for with the location and amenities. We splurged for our honeymoon and were very comfortable. It was in a great location and we thoroughly enjoyed our time at this hotel!,1
Large reliable hotel in midtown near shopping and theatres.,1
This place is great with two caveats:1- Expect very long lineups during check-in and check-out (check-out is not automated like other Hilton locations).2- The prices at the bar are outrageous. I had two rum and cokes and it was close to $40 USD with the tip they add on automatically and other strange fees. Go to any bar a block away and it will be half this or less.,1
Room service was knocking on the door everyday around 8:30. Overall it's nice| but for the price of it they should invest into some new furniture...,1
Room was clean and neat and right across the street from my client,1
I like the location| staff's behavior| cleanliness even it's old. I had no grumble at all and that's unusual in US recently. Well-balanced hotel!,1
The hotel was very good| a little bit old in the decor and it feels like a very used hotel| with a little bit of the infrastructure in need for replacement. The fitness center was very very good| with plenty of machines and space to weight train and stretch.  The staff were very courteous and the breakfast setting was great.  The area is very convenient with both Central Park| and Times Square only a few blocks away.  We got a great deal on hotels.com with breakfast| so aim for that if possible.,1
The room was also next to a supply closet which staff accessed at 1:30am while chatting loudly in the hallway. Otherwise the hotel is great and well situated. Beware...Overnight parking was $75!!,1
Nati at the front desk was excellent. The continental breakfast at the executive lounge was very good and convenient. The executive lounge overall was great. The hotel location was also very convenient.,1
Hotel was clean and felt safe because you needed room card to get into the building,1
very clean comfortable to get around  staff friendly for the most part,1
Hilton Midtown is so close to so many attractions. Easy to get subways to other locations. A great place to stay!,1
The rooms were big| though the air conditioning did not stay cold even after 2 calls and a tech in the room. The overall friendliness of everyone added to the stay| though if you do stay park somewhere else||...$$$$$$$$,1
Wonderful stay with lovely breakfast| bed very comfortable|room could have a bigger wardrobe| no line in bathroom for drying clothes| they charge $5 USD to store each bag after checkout and no where to freshen up while waiting for a late night flight.,1
"Perfect location! Room is very comfortable. Concierge Desk provides Broadway tickets. Got free upgrade. Free wi-fi. Resort fee of $25 a day gives you $15/$10 lounge/kitchen items to spend. 55"" flat screen TV in the room with premium TV channels. Still trying to figure out what the ""Hilton Club"" is. Breakfast at the Herb N Kitchen is great! Cold and hot dishes with fruits| omelette cook station. Big spread of breakfast items.",1
Overall a typical Hilton. Clean| updated| fine.  Good amenities on the main level.,1
Great location and friendly staff.  It's a big hotel| but that's fine.  A big room by NY standards.,1
Spent a few days here for our engagement.  Excellent hotel. Actually upgraded us and sent champagne to the room!!! Nice touch Hilton.,1
Nice facility centrally located in mid town.,1
The only thing I really did not like was having my do not disturb sign on the door and housekeeping still came into my room while I was out! Definitely an invasion of privacy!,1
Great location| convenient to shops and restaurants.,1
I am a Hilton honors rewards member| and they do not want to honor my stay| and give me my reward points for my stay.  In addition they charged an additional mandatory charge for room incidental which I normally do not use.  Forcing me to buy products in the hotel.,0
Very nice hotel| large rooms ideal for families| very good breakfast,1
Perfect location! Great staff and clean hotel . Always stay at the Midtown Hilton Hotel.,1
Centrally located in Manhattan to Times Square| near Central Park.,1
Changed rooms twice. Booked into wrong room type to start with. The second room smelled stale. They charged me an extra 25/day claiming it state mandated and they giving me extras I don't need for it. I felt violated.,0
Great service and location!(Your 50 character minimum is very very very silly Expedia!),1
I will be back here next year! So closed to 5th Ave.| Central park and Time square,1
However if you've had a late night be prepared to be disturbed early in the morning when housekeeping are making their rounds. They are loud and will wake you :(,1
Good til last night.  Woke at 12:30 am to strong smell of pot.  Not sure what to do| so endured it.  Had to get up at 3 am to go to airport so did not appreciate the smell waking all of us.  2 or 3 machines in the fitness area were also broken.,1
Hotel was fine and location was great.  Hotel staff was very friendly. Room was also larger than most NY hotels near the theater district.,1
The room was spacious| especially for New York| and the location was incredible! We were just a couple of blocks from Central Park| shopping on Fifth Avenue| and Times Square. The staff was gracious and accommodating. Everything was perfect- we will stay here again.,1
Upon arrival our daughter's bed was not made up. Old |worn out rooms. Absence of cleaning and vacuuming the dirtiest carpets we've ever seen in a $400 per day hotel. Found contact lenses from previous customers left by the window.They are still there.... We had to ask for sheets to get changed otherwise the staff does not do it.In short cleaning means just making up the beds.,0
Service was excellent.  The check-in process simple and fast.  The Concierge was extremely helpful and cordial.,1
Perfect Service. Best Choice! Breakfast an Bars very nice !,1
Location| location| locationProbably to many people but the hotel handles de situation and everything goes as expected,1
Excelent room| beautiful hotel and the localization is amazing. All perfect.,1
excellent position| just 5 minutes walk from central park and from every possible subway to reach all manhattan locations with ease,1
The hotel location is great. It's only 200 meters away from MOMA.,1
Very dirty| bathroom was smelly| shower was horrible| way to loud at night. No valley parking,0
Location| friendliness of staff,1
Overall it was nice stay. Personnel was friendly. Room was clean and comfortable. Good location if you planning to spend time in Chelsea or Fashion district.,1
Good stay. Did not appreciate a surprise $25 early check in fee.,1
Great staff at Check-In. Very friendly and efficient. Was greeted as soon as I walked in,1
Great location. Friendly and helpful staff. Great room for great price.,1
This place is awesome great staff. Very nearby 5th avenue. I would recommend to stay at Hilton fashion district,1
Rooftopbar is cool and staff and rooms are all excellent.,1
great location! short walks to subway stations lots of restaurants around! lots of great places to stop on the longer walks also! friendly staff and everything was pretty efficient!,1
Clean hotel| nice staff| small rooms| but that is normal for NY,1
Our stay was great. Perfect location. Great price. Awesome service. Disappointed that our room has no refrigerator or ice buckets.,1
I absolutely loved my stay here. The hotel is situated in a perfect location. Really close to subway stations. The staff are lovely| would always greet me by name and were always happy to assist me with extra English breakfast tea| sugars and creamers. I loved the rooftop bar too. I will definitely be coming back to New York and I will certainly be staying here! Thank you New York Hilton it's been such a pleasure!,1
Great hotel| kind personnel| good ubication but we had some issues with our room getting cleaned.,1
Parking was down the street and no valet parking! Major inconvenience,1
Great place to stay at,1
The location was perfect.  Centrally located for all of my appointments,1
The hotel staff was very friendly and professional. The hotel lobby was set up very cute and inviting. The rooms very very clean and safe. I will Definitely be back again and tell all my friends about The Hilton Hotel New York Fashion District.,1
Staff was very professional| helpfull and nice. Hotel was ok| didn't have ice machines available due to COVID restrictions. Kind of expensive but well everything in NYC is expensive. A/c in room not that great but everything was clean and in good conditions.,1
The service was amazing the people at the front desk were awesome. Everything about this stay was awesome!!!,1
Great staff - always very kind and helpful! Clean| quiet room (14th floor alley side) with actually comfy beds! A fridge would've been helpful| but I didn't think to check on that before my arrival. I would choose this location again.,1
Horrible. Shower and bathroom was disgusting & I was forced to shower in another room due to the broken shower. Had to fight for somewhat of a refund| disgusting.,0
Hotel is very unremarkable. Room is fine.  Bathroom is fine. Front desk staff a bit on the ‚Äúsassy‚Äù side. Wouldn't make a point to stay here again.  Neighborhood feels more ‚Äújust off Times Square| than cute And Cozy Chelsea.  But all was fine,1
We would absolutely stay here again!! Location to subway is great but so not unreasonable walk to Broadway/Times Square,1
Our stay was amazing. The staff is so friendly and helpful!! They recommended great restaurants and gave good directions. They were so accommodating!! I would definitely stay there again!!,1
We had a generally pleasant 4-night stay at this conveniently located (just off 7th Ave. near the subway and a few blocks from Penn Station) hotel in my favorite town.  We were out most of the day and pleased to rest in a comfortable bed in a cool room. Due to pandemic regulations| there was no ice available and room cleaning was only every 3 days.  We put out our garbage outside the door which was collected daily.  The room was very compact (NY size) and the bathroom was serviceable| but needs more hooks to hang towels.  Note that there's also no fridge and not all the elevators were in service.  There's also construction going on| as the front of the hotel was protected by scaffolding.  Reception was friendly and any requests for towels| etc. were delivered promptly.  After checkout| it was so convenient to be able to leave our suitcases at the front desk for a bit.,1
The Hilton is very centrally located in the city with good food close by. The rooms are a little small but to be expected for NYC. The staff is great and the wifi is very reliable,1
Just the best. Great location. Exceptional staff with excellent service from the front desk to the cleaning crew. Our every want was met immediately. Location near everything in the mid-town area. Great knowledge of the places to eat and see in the area. People always smiling and ready to help. Three elevators so no waiting and no lines.,1
The staff was very nice and accomodating. The room had a few stains on the wall| looked like spills or splashes of some sort. There was a crouton on the side of the bed. I  loved the location. Overall was a good stay| the cleanliness details need a bit more attention.,1
Most inconspicuous Hilton I've seen. Views were okay. Elevators are slow.,1
I overall had a decent stay but there aren't any refrigerators in the rooms and also no on site restaurant so that was inconvenient,1
Very friendly staff and attentive. Very good experience and would stay here in a heartbeat.,1
Good property for money,1
My guest and myself got stuck in the elevator and management showed no concern they reacted as if that has happen before the stated let me take it down dismissing us rude bad experiences,0
When I first arrived my room sheets were dirty and there was blood on the bathroom floor. Hotel changed my room which was great. There are no amenities. No refrigerator| microwave| ice machine| just nowhere to get a drink of water unless you leave the hotel. Big inconvenience for me.,0
Under renovation but great service & area.,1
The most disappointing Hilton we have ever stayed at. They didn't clean the room the entire time we were there!! 4 days with no clean sheets or towels!! No ice machine! We had to walk a couple blocks for ice. The included breakfast was not available and they did not compensate for this. The room was much smaller than the pictures online. No microwave| no fridge and the in room bar was empty. They only good part of the room was the shower. Overall this was a terrible room and I would look elsewhere for a hotel.,0
Our experience with this hotel was very very disappointing. Especially for a Hilton. The room was not cleaned one time during our 4 night stay. Not once! We even asked for it to be cleaned including fresh sheets but they never came. The air conditioning was not very good. The room was very small compared to the pictures online. No refrigerator| no ice machine| no microwave| the in room bar was empty and the parking was down the street. We had to walk a few blocks for a bag of ice! There is also a $50 per day charge that's extra. There was 3 of us in the room and we had to ask for clean towels everyday and every time they would bring only 2! It was overall a terrible disappointment. I would not recommend this Hilton at all.,0
I wish the room was a little bit bigger and that the beds were bigger. NO ICE MACHINE was a drag. Nice restaurant and rooftop cafe within hotel| but they were really expensive. Overall though| it was a nice stay.,1
Great location and friendly s,1
Even though my arrival was far from smooth( ac not working| shower cold) Simin ZhengI and her staff were very professional and helpful and made my stay outstanding!!Thank you so much for everything.Best|Thilo,1
The front desk clerk name syd was a lifesaver and helped me saved time and the trouble with returning the rental car,1
First time to NY| hotel was nice and clean. I didn't get a chance to hang out at the roof top bar| which I think should be open to folks staying at the hotel without reservations. I was told you had to make reservations. Only thing I would've added was a fridge and access to ice. I enjoyed the stay. Great location as well.,1
We were told the in house restaurant and bar were closed so we received our $50/day resort credits at a convenience store down the street.  The first day it was fun but no one wants to eat there for four days.  At least we never ran out of bottled water.  Also there was no housekeeping due to covid but they don't tell you that until you arrive.  The staff was amazingly helpful but with the lack of housekeeping| the mess outside (construction)| the only one working elevator removed the glamour of my first trip to NYC.  It wasn't horrible but I wish I had stayed somewhere else.,1
Hotel was under construction/ renovation. Fitness room was also closed for renovation. No microwave or fridge in the room. Only a small locked fridge to dispense their own merchandise. No drinking water available: only Hilton honor members could get 2 bottle water a day. I was at many Hilton hotels before and this was the worst. Front desk people were friendly and polite.,0
This is a not a 4 star hotel. It was the perfect example of when hotel companies strip services. No ice machine. handicap stay away. You cannot make an ice pack.  No refrigerator it's not what I expected.,0
Great service| comfortable room| nice location. I lived in NY for 5 years and just came back to visit and Hilton is definitely worth returning to!,1
The room,0
"Our experience was terrible| especially considering that it was our first time traveling after Covid. This is a Hilton? The front of the building is covered in unmarked scaffolding with the only barely noticeable| unlit Hilton signage set way back and printed on the temporary ""plastic"" entry doors that can only be seen when you walk by and look really hard. Our room was dark and depressing with very dark blue carpeting| dark brown (almost black) dinged up furniture| and a dark blue photo wall (of abstrated ""trees""?) The carpeting was dusty| the TV remote was dead and when we took it down to the front desk (we also requested an extra pillow)| we never heard from anyone again| and never got back the remote - or the pillow. The bed felt really old and soft| the outlet next to the bed was dead and didn't charge my phone| and the room phone was dead (and filthy). Also| the fitness facility was still closed with no mention of that on Expedia or in the hotel notes| and there was dirty laundry - stained towels and sheets - left on the floor hallway outside our room for hours. Someone spilled candy in the hall that was crushed into the dirty carpet and stayed that way for two days. UGH| Hilton| never again. Our son just moved to the neighborhood and we plan to be there often but there are a lot of other options - we won't be back.",0
I liked the convenience of the location.  The staff was very friendly and informative. I didnt like that there was no microwave or refrigerator.   It would have been nice to be able to reheat some food if we wanted to.,1
Overall the experience was good. Only feedback is would've been nice to have a fridge to put our drinks in. The fridge is designed so that it is strictly a mini bar. The gym is also small and dated. But for the amount we paid the hotel was clean & staff was friendly. I would stay there again.,1
Nice clean property.  We were on 8th floor very noisy street,1
Great location| close to everything.  Staff was very friendly and responsive to any requests we had.,1
Spacious room and clean room. Nice lobby| great location.,1
Great location and nice rooms. Only negative was Rooftop bar was closed for renovations.,1
located exactly where we were going to be during our stay.,1
Nice modern clean room| great hotel. No view and lower floor|  but we didn't pay for higher floor.,1
Great location| fast checking and staff is so friendly and helpful.  Room is large for a NYC hotel.,1
Location was great| staff was friendly| room was clean,1
I liked how secluded the hotel was| did not like how the restaurant/bar was under renovation,1
We love this location. Easily Accessible to midtown and downtown area. It is our go to hotel when in the area. The hotel rooftop bar is awesome. The rooms are clean and fairly large for a NYC hotel.,1
Great location and close to lots of food options close to MSG and Grand Central Station.,1
Smell of marijuana in lobby and elevator at night. Overall good experience.,1
Good Hilton hotel. Good location| subway is a couple of blocks away but no big deal. Restaurant and rooftop were closed for remodeling. Clean| small rooms but ok size for New York. Good service. No Hilton points if booked on expedia.,1
Great location and walking distance to many landmark attractions,1
Hotel was great. Great location.,1
Great room. Friendly staff. Convenient location.,1
Quick and easy to check in and out| happy they had valley parking| cool simple clean bathroom. Comfortable bed Can I prove snacks in the room.,1
The hotel was clean| modern and comfortable| away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square but only a 10-15 minute walk away.  A convenient subway station is only three blocks away.  Good selection of TV channels.  Pouty children in the adjoining room could be easily heard. Main complaint was with their so-called ‚Äúroom service‚Äù.  At check-in the receptionist said the restaurant was not operating but that we could order ‚Äú24 hour room service‚Äù.  It turned out their ‚Äúroom service‚Äù was an 800 phone call to an outside operation that sent half warm food from who knows where by delivery boy.  Being Christmas evening when calling to order and discovering the true nature of this ‚Äúservice‚Äù| we had no Plan B.  Maybe this is a new fad employed nowadays by hotels?  Don't know. But we felt the receptionist was purposely vague| if not outright misleading| in saying they had ‚Äúroom service‚Äù. Also we did not like the motion sensor light in the bathroom| but that was easily foiled by placing a towel over the sensor.  All in all| a quite suitable hotel.,1
Bars and restaurants were out of service. Location is just far enough north to be suitable,1
Great location. Rooms are clean. Very pleasant staff,1
Very friendly service. Room was comfortable and quiet. I'd stay there again for sure!,1
Had a wonderful stay in this lovely hotel. Would definitely stay again,1
Big screen & HBO| bureau and a chair for some late night work| perfect for work travel,1
Facilities could be better| Rooms are new york style small and staff could be more professional,1
The hotel was great and the staff was amazing.,1
Everything was fine. Good location near subway| comfortable bed| quick early check in. The property is starting to look a little worn.,1
Circular drive as you enter/check in. Lots of restaurants and sites to walk to. No restaurant or roof top bar| as they are being renovated. No room service. No vending. Mini fridge coke cost $4.75. No parking...just an offer to park down the street. I left my charger and it took them an hour and a half to look for it and get back to me| by then I had to leave to travel back home.,1
Noise through door no sound barrier couldn't sleep 3 nights,0
Great locationLovely room and facilities Nice friendly staffGood valueIdeal if visiting Madison square garden,1
All in all not a bad place to stay. But my room had a funny smell .,1
It was very central to a lot of touristy places as well as Macy,1
It was a good no frills hotel would return again in the future.,1
Location was great. Hotel was was nice. Disappointed the rooftop bar was closed.,1
I didn't know the hotel was under renovations. Also the room fridge is not available for personal items which is unfortunate. I felt these things should've been communicated more clearly,1
The staff was rude upon arrival| booked a top floor room with a city view. But got a room facing construction end wall| The most unpleasant 5 nights stay. Feel like entrapment. Never again will I book this hotel.,0
Nice new comfortable hotel. Nice size for a New York hotel at this price. Great bargain!,1
Great property & very well situated Walking distance to everything,1
No parking available......had to find parking space,1
Bed was a little smaller than a queen but we managed ok. There was some minor issues with the safe not closing but again we just kept trying. Finally| they need to add a floor lamp or better ceiling lights in the entry to our room 1005. It was a little dark. The nice part about this room is that it was at the end of the hall (which is not very long) and opened up to the street. Nice natural light. It is on the noisy side due to a nightclub being down the road.,1
The property was very clean and the check-in and out process was seamless.  However| the room was dark| even with all the lights turns on and it is definitely worn a bit.  It's a typical NYC hotel room size and condition.  The location was very convenient to a Whole Foods and a subway station,1
Last minute trip for my Birthday the staff was very helpful and accommodating and a great price! I was one happy guest!,1
Very clean hotel and nice staff. Love the rooftop bar,1
Had a great visit....my second time and will visit again. Although| another guest on the 14rh floor with a restless infant felt compelled to often bring their screaming and annoying infant (and| I'm a parent) to the 14th floor elevator corridor and let the infant scream there. Highly inconsiderate | ignorant and ludicrous!,1
one of the best hotels I ever stayed at | everyone was fun & sweet to us thanks again!!,1
Awesome hotel convenient location,1
The hotel was close to transportation. It had a rooftop bar that seemed to appeal to young people. Our first room was not clean at all. We were moved to another cleaner room but it had a queen bed. Our reservation was for a king size bed. The girl expained that this room was more expensive than the king on a lower floor but they would not charge us more. Head scratcher! There was no fridge| not even a mirror outside the bathroom. Did not live up to Hilton standards. I just feel that they took advantage of us. We did not get what we paid for. How can you help us Expedia?,0
Room was very nice and clean,1
it was great,1
Room is small and air conditioner  is noisy.  Roomservice phone number is not function and take long time for them to respond. Location is very good,0
The worst experience!   The sheets and pillows had been sprayed right before we checked in| the smell was so potent that it made me physically ill.  The hotels resolution was so give me 5|000 points.  This is unacceptable however the hotel manager was rude and  informed me they would not be compensating me any further|  I am an Hilton Honors member and I will NOT be staying at Hilton Hotels any longer!,0
Property is well situated between Midtown and lower Manhattan| with transportation and nearby shopping| this property is a great place to stay.,1
Good location and nice size room easy in and out. Rooftop bar.,1
Great location and clean.,1
The hotel is not worthy of the Hilton brand which is the only reason I trusted it would be truly 4 star.,0
Location was perfect - a couple blocks from subway; and walkable distance to the Greenwich Village and midtown Manhattan.,1
I did not like that check in was so delayed for such a time-pressured day. We came for pride and I had requested an early check in weeks prior and then the day of I called at 12 pm and was told a room would be ready by 1 pm just to find out that no room was ready and we waited 2 and a half hours for a room to open and went past the normal check-in time. We missed half the parade.,0
I like this place is very clean and price is reasonable in NYC.,1
Wish there was an ice machine as we couldn't have any cold water/drinks. Also wish the fridge wasn't completely pre occupied with drinks you had to pay for. We had brought drinks that needed to be in the fridge but had to just get over that. Besides that the front desk people were amazing in making our world pride trip a success and letting us know how to take the subway when all streets were blocked. It was a life saver.,1
The property is nice. Room is good. Bed is comfortable. The staff was great. The young man who checked me in and out went out of his way to help me.,1
Customer service was great both in the hotel and restaurant!,1
Went to New York with my girlfriend for the weekend it was a lot of un and the hotel was clean and modern.,1
It's not a ‚ÄúHilton‚Äù. They just slap the name ‚ÄúHilton‚Äù on it.,0
Hotel had a dirty sock that did not belong to us next to the bed. Otherwise room appeared clean. Bellhop was nice and helpful and so was the receptionist. At night we had friends over at the rooftop bar. Before they left we were having a conversation in the lobby for a while.  We were approached by a staff member who asked if we were guests in the hotel| to which I replied that myself and my husband were but not the other 3 people. He then demanded to see a room key which my husband was looking for. He then demanded more aggressively that we show him our key which I produced. We all understand that safety is key and that he was within his rights to ask to see it| however as a group of black people being approached by another black man that was sent by the white man over to us and being spoken to so inappropriately| we took great offense. This was around 1:15am on Sunday morning on 6/16/19.  Teach your staff that they are working in the hospitality industry (which I have a degree in) requires addressing guests with the utmost respect,0
Great place to stay. Very convenient| friendly staff.,1
Great property. Near to the subway and great staff!!,1
Convenient location| staff very nice| clean and quiet rooms.,1
Good place| recommend place| everything was good !,1
Nice hotel and well located. The hotel is clean and staff are very friendly.,1
Nice accommodations| little pricy for the value as the room was on the smaller side and the dark blue wallpaper made the room a lot darker than necessary.,1
The hotel was clwan and nice.  FIT University and Korean Town were also nearby. But I was a bit loud as to whether to work at dawn.,1
Location| quality and friendly staff -- overall great stay.,1
Not a 4 star hotel| at best 3 star. small boutique hotel. not the hilton you may think,0
Comfortable,1
Clean rooms....Rennovated restrooms.....Front desk staff was very nice,1
We were staying just one night  We got a great rate| location was ideal for what we were doing.  Friendly and helpful staff. Clean comfortable accommodations,1
The staff were wonderful and helpful. I thought the location was okay. But it was a respectable and nice place to stay,1
Great hotel| Great location.,1
Nice hotel and great location in Chelsea.,1
Great hotel. The room was fantastic. Loved the decor and the bed was very comfortable. I would stay again.,1
My stayed was terrible| the hotel hallway smelled like weed| the people next to my room were smoking weed and the security had to come over a few times |it was a lot of noise and I couldn't sleep. This is unacceptable in a smoke free facility. I am very dissapointed with my stayed at this hotel,0
Room smaller than advertised.  Horrible experience coming home to an uncleaned room even after requesting service midday.  Property offered no compensation.   Definitely not up to Hilton standards by any means|  more like a bad Motel 6.  Do not recommend this property.,0
Great location and no issues with the room either. The only issue was the elevator would take forever to come| that needs some updating specially for the money that is charged per night.,1
The hotel itself and the Hotels.com wasn't accurate regarding the price of valet parking. Once checking in| I was told that the valet price was $60 though Hotels.com stated $55.,1
I really liked the cleanliness and everything was great| but I think if they could care a little more on sound proofing| then it would be excellent.,1
We had a great little weekend getaway and the Hilton was a big part of that. Perfect location for us to hang out in Chelsea. Loved Crompton Ale House directly across the street.,1
Staff was very nice at check in and we were surprised to find out there was a rooftop bar upon arrival! Great location and stay overall,1
Everything was great!,1
Will come again but not the inflated prices.  Not there.,1
Check in and check out was so fast! Room was as expected. The only thing that sucked was that there was a couple next to our room and all you could hear was all the fun they were having(if you know what I mean). Good thing me and my friend had made other plans to hang out in the city so we didn't hear too much of anything so overall it was an okay experience!,1
We stayed at the Hilton in the Fashion district on the President's day weekend of 2019.The location was excellent because it was centrally located and close to the subway.  It's a nice neighborhood between Chelsea and the Flatiron district. There are cool restaurants and bars for a dinner or nightcap. Parking on the street was available. The hotel is modern with a classy lobby. Our room was small by most suburban hotel standards but for the location and price| it was a value.,1
Fantastic stay- very accommodating in moving my room when I requested a king bed instead of 2 is.,1
This property is located in a convenient location close to public transportation. The room wasn't huge but it was a comfortable size for a NYC hotel room. The staff was very helpful and friendly. It was a great hotel for the price.,1
Everyone was very friendly and helpful| the hotel bar staff was great! I felt like for the money it was a great deal| but mostly I would stay there again just because of the people that work there!,1
We stayed at the Hilton during the polar vortex. Staff was wonderful and checkin was super fast. However| both me and my wife got bedbug bites all over our back! We had a short stay and on the morning of our flight back home we noticed we were itchy and my wifes back is covered in red bumps. Im grossed out. The hotel is in an excellent location. The room was small which is normal for nyc| but the thermostat was so dry i kept waking up to drink and hack a lung. It was the dryest hotel I've ever stayed at.. again it was the polar vortex so maybe not their fault but im wondering about their filter systems and such. The bed was comfortable but soo hot. I would unfortunately not stay here again :( we like the cambria and ace. Im sorry to write this but I wish i had read a review about the bedbugs prior to booking :(,0
Everything was terrific - very clean and comfortable| service was great!  Love the rooftop bar as well!,1
Location was ideal for my 2-day stay in NYC. Room was small but bed was very comfortable| bathroom was clean and relatively spacious| TV options (including HBO) were good. Quiet except for street noise that died down by midnight. I didn't patronize the restaurant/bar but menu looked good and it was an attractive space.,1
I had such an awesome time. Professional service thru out .,1
The hotel is nice and has a great rooftop bar. However| drinks are very expensive and kids are not allowed up to look at the view. Our room was very small and crowded for 4 of us but we made it work. And the room did not have a refrigerator or ice available| we did not like this at all. The mini bar should be replaced with a refrigerator.,1
It was absolutely freezing in the hotel during the coldest two days of the season. The thermostat on the wall was useless. I turned the heat up and the fan yet there was no change in the heat in the room. It wasn't just my room either. Colleagues of mine had drinks at the lobby bar and had to wear their jackets to be even remotely comfortable.,0
Excellent check in| nice room| high floor| not much of a view| no bathtub but excellent shower-Parking on street around the corner-no complaints!,1
The view was the best part I found myself sleeping with the window shades open so I could see it all as I fell asleep. I was on the 20th floor definitely recommend!! You could still hear sounds of the city but it just added to the experience. The room was nice and decent sized very comfortable bed and pillows.,1
The rooms are cozy but well laid out with large flat screen TV| K-cup coffee and and outstanding shower with hot hot water. Nice view of empire state building and a great location near the action in mid town Manhattan but not in the middle of the action (i.e.| not too close to Times Square),1
It was a very nice trip. Would stay again however at 6pm when we got into town our room wasn't ready and we had to wait for it to be cleaned when we were told checknin was at 3,1
Nice hotel | small rooms . Shower floor was dirty .,1
Very pleasant staff!  Room was small but just was we needed üòä,1
Front desk amazing customer service.  Rooms great size and very clean.  Room service fast and sweet.,1
The room was very big unlike the ROW. WE WE went on rooftop for New Year's Eve party. The party was good and played good music. Many people cane casual. I wore a gown. I was more dressed up. I think there should be address code in a 4 star hotel for NY eve.,1
I loved the neighborhood| Chelsea| and how easy it was to get everywhere on the subway. My favorite part was all the great places to eat around here.  Nice people too.,1
Staff was EXCEPTIONAL!! Very helpful and friendly. Very cool rooftop bar but have to be 21 to go up there. Rooms are small but that's too be expected in NYC!!,1
 Had to get used to being in such a small room| but this is NYC| right? That aside| everything was great.,1
Such a great stay. Staff  was amazing. I go to basketball games every year. I will now call that place my new hotel.,1
Great location| friendly staff. Rooms were very clean!,1
Room was much smaller than I expected but it was clean and cozy. It was inconvenient to have to call the front desk for ice since there was no ice machine on the floor.,1
Just very easy. Smooth to check in| left luggage there all day| easy to check out.,1
I wish I had the time to check out the rooftop bar.,1
Great NYC location. Just Two blocks from Penn Stattion.  Room was pristine.,1
Really really nice! Great staff| came in to laughs and smiles. The bed was INCREDIBLE| I had trouble leaving the bed. Loved it,1
Nice and very quiet for Manhattan area.  Good hotel| great location.,1
Love the location.  We could walk to many places.Easy check in,1
Nice hotel| clean and modern room| great location to Penn Station and Comedy club| bars| restaurants.,1
Great location - decent room size . Friendly staff. Shout out to Mary at the Front desk . Clean safe area - used to love in NYC . Parking expensive and had a little issue with a broken side mirror but hotel and front desk manager were right on it . Look for special deals !!,1
Noise from street reaches as high as 8th floor. Not okay for family stay as the rooms are very small| bathroom shower is very small. No exhaust fan in bathroom. Okay to crash after a bar hopping night out. Weekends tend to be noisiest when mostly drunk people wander in the lobby.,0
Very convenient location| good rates| friendly staff| nice room.,1
Excellent hotel in excellent location. A few blocks away from Madison Square Gardens.,1
Great place| unfortunately rooftop BST was closed but other than that it rocked.,1
it was a good location,1
Staff behavior was terrible. Basic amenities that should be complimentary are unnecessarily paid.,0
Good central location.  Quiet room.  I would stay here again.,1
Great spot one of my routine places to stay in NYC... great location walking distance to Penn Station... rooms a little small but Hilton quality.,1
staff was friendly.Beds were comfortable.No problem as far as I know.,1
My stay was fantastic.  The room was comfortable| clean and quiet (the quiet part isn't that important to me but I know it is for others).  The neighborhood is vibrant and has plenty of nearby resources (restaurants| convenience stores| drug stores| etc).  The staff is friendly and helpful and they have a rooftop bar!,1
Clean| modern| great location.,1
Hotel charged me 66.54 extra.for no reason whatsoever. I didnt use mini bar. Checked out on time. Accounting department is non existant. They dont pick up their phones and mailbox is full. No More Hilltons!,0
Close to Macy's and all of the Fashion Districtis a short walk away!,1
Nothing to complain about! Excellent stay and magnificent view of the city from our 21st floor room!,1
This is a nice place to stay in NY without costing a fortune. The staff is very nice and the hotel restaurant is really good too. I would definitely stay here again.,1
This hotel was just what I was looking for. The location was perfect. Not to far from any of the tourist stuff but also not in the middle of it either. Felt like I could live there. The hotel staff was great and very helpful. The hotel was very clean and I was happy with the condition of the hotel overall. This is one of the best hotels that I have stayed at in my years of traveling.,1
The room and the hotel overall was really nice. My only problem was the room was small and tight. The staff were wonderful and really helpful!,1
Good location allows you to walk to parks| shopping and restaurants. Subway| bus and train access is close as well. Nice amenities in the room and comfortable bed.  Really enjoyed the rooftop bar| that is a plus.,1
Excellent location. The hotel is very clean| quiet and close to all the key points to visit  in Chelsea/Mid TownThe hotel crew was very gentile| polite and aware of all the details.,1
Conveniently located to many great restaurants and sight seeing places like the flatiron building. Service was good and the room was better than expected. Great views from the rooftop! I would stay again at this hotel.,1
Will come back again if life ever allows me to. Thank you to the staffing! Only complaint was that I had to leave to go back home‚Ä¶ lol,1
The location was perfect,1
Great Hotel| near to Battery park| Walstreet| 9/11 Memorial(One world Trade center). Front desk staff at the hotel is very professional.,1
Took forever to check in| they seemed to have lost our reservation| the next day our room keys were disconnected and no longer worked to open our rooms| and it always took forever for the elevator to come (3 elevators for 40  floors is insufficient),0
Elevators were very slow| no valet parking| lobby on 2nd floor| room was very very small| construction all around hotel| the only good thing was the staff were nice,0
Liked location but they lied about the price of room.,0
Not new but decent place to stay at the location if the prices are on discount. The elevators are always busy but acceptable generally for tourists. Room is nice and clean. Staffs are kind of friendly. Amenities are excellent!,1
I didn't like the elevator situation.  Very crowded and hard to get on.  The fees for parking were outrageous.,1
Everything with the hotel was fine and is beautiful| just the parking lot is not good.,1
If you want a hotel because location this is good because is close to vessel| little island| statue liberty and color museum. If the hotel is for relax‚Ä¶. Noooo is terrible| dirty| staff can't constantly clean your room because| not enough towels just 2 and we are 5| you call to guest service and you request something and you need to call again and again,1
This place was a mess!,0
Great location| we love it.,1
Great Downtown location| close to main attractions| good food| and subway stations to explore everything around.I do believe in treating people well and you get the same back. The staff was friendly and attentive to the needs.,1
Was decent| very close to the subway and battery park| elevator wait was long at times| but was moderately priced so you get what you pay for,1
Rooms are clean but extremely small| limited amenities| not high end| but satisfactory for a one night stay,1
Decent hotel| good prices for area.Poor elevator wait times for size of building.,1
Great location| nice staff.,1
Getting to hotel was a nightmare since the street was closed. I had to call hotel and the worker wasn't knowledgeable at all about where I was located to help me. I was actually just around the block too| which makes me think she was just rude. When I arrived| she was not friendly| when I left there were additional| unfriendly to say the least workers. The shower edges need to be cleaned and recaulked. The beds didn't really fit the double bedroom| very squishy. I've stayed in better hotels in New York| so I was very disappointed from the arrival to departure. And it was very expensive.,1
Great place to stay!  Our room had a great view!!  That was so unexpected but very appreciated!  Staff was accommodating as well!,1
we enjoyed our stay here.  We felt safe and did not have any problems,1
they always charge me a damage fee($350) even though I never damage hotel rooms. they hold the money for THREE TO FIVE days after the hotel stay| even though I have stayed there 5 times and have no record of destroying hotel property.,0
Because of COVID they didn't clean the room which was fine but always having to ask for things and go from a high floor down to the lobby was a pain I wish they would make it easier to get supplies and not feel so bad. Also it's the only Doubletree I've been to that doesn't have cookies! Otherwise the hotel was great!,1
staff was terrible,0
Good overall| they need more elevators!,1
The staff was very pleasant and accommodating. The rooms were not too big| but very comfortable and had amazing city views.. The small convenience / microwave area in the lobby was very nice to have!,1
Your elevator problem is beyond terrible.,1
Elevator wait time was 10 -15 mins at times. Check in was 45 later than normal due to computer issues,0
Very convenient location.,1
I did not stay there I stayed somewhere else.I did not realize I had actually booked this until I saw a charge on my credit card.I tried to call expedia but was waiting on the phone for 45 minutes with no response.Very disappointed and will never use Expedia again,0
Reserved a specific room (King size bed with city view). Upon arrival was given a ‚Äú story ‚Äú about water damage ‚Äú allegedly ‚Äú on floor of reserved room.Instead of being provided a room equal in all aspects was given a down size (twin room beds| no city view) for as stated ‚Äú same price.‚Äù,0
I like it was near the ferry.,1
I booked a king bed with a river view and got a tiny queen bed with no view. Staff said i got what Expedia sent to them. So I'm not sure who to blame or where to get my refund,0
Clean place. Love the location.,1
It advertised Breakfast but there was not even COFFEE.... For a High rise Hotel with 44  Floors having 2 of 3 Elevators down is Unsafe and Definitely a health Risk...I wanted to call the Health inspector or Fire Marshal to report but reconsidered because of the Hotel staff's Composure and poise in handling the influx of frustration ... Our Room of Two double beds was Seriously cramped ...(My Honest opinion),0
Wonderful staff and a clean environment love the stay,1
I stayed here for 12 days. As a long staying guest I was expecting great service| (which I guess as a guest I should expect regardless) however| it has been my worst stay at a hotel to date. First of all| the staff here at the reception is the poorest| most unhelpful| RUDEST staff I've ever seen in the hospitality industry. The staff was not helpful in anyway and would reply rudely and abruptly to any request or question. Since we were staying at the hotel for longer| we could get our room cleaned throughout the stay| we asked 5 times until someone cleaned the room and trust me when i say ‚Äúclean‚Äù| it was just taking out the trash. There were also no soap| or toilet paper in the bathroom that I had to get down and get because there was no staff to bring anything to the room.Anyway| I can stand pretty much anything except for the rude staff here: they really left the most bitter taste in my mouth. I wish I hadn't stayed here.,0
The staff was rude. The room wasn't clean. Lights didn't work in the room. The coffee maker had mildew and old water in it. Horrible for a Hilton property.,0
The lack of elevators made traveling to/from the upper levels complicated. There was always a line.Also i tried to get room service and they never answered.,0
Great quiet location close to several train stops.  Very convenient to reach my son in Brooklyn!,1
The staff was really nice but the building is older. I had issues with the water and well as a plastic bag was placed over the smoke detector.,0
Great area and staff was great,1
Crowded with party people. Loud at night. Scary fights late at night in the corridors. We were moved to a higher floor but the situation did not change| on the contrary.There are 3 elevators for a tower of 45 floors. We spent nearly 20 min to catch the elevator.,0
Good experience. Will definitely stay there again.,1
Property is in a good location and the price was very reasonable.,1
Great location,1
Solid location. Parking is cheap if you stay here which is a huge plus. Nice gym. No real issues. Run of the mill room.,1
Like most places in New York City the room was a little small but very comfortable for my wife and I. The staff was very nice and pleasant to deal with. The room was clean and everything in it functioned fine. the view from our room was also nice. We were on the 37th floor facing the river. We would definitely stay there again. The hotel was also pretty convenient to getting around. Great restaurants nearby and easy access to the trains.,1
no fridge or microwave in the room.,1
Clean and quiet.,1
There is no sound barrier between rooms. During our whole stay the couple next door kept arguing at awful times of the night and we could hear EVERYTHING. Elevato,0
The ladies at the front desk were just rude and made you feel like you were an inconvenience or bothering them,0
I didn't like how you didn't get fresh towels each day & the cleaning services didn't attend to your room regularly.,1
Didn't like the off site parking and that the fees isn't one time pay and isn't included in reservations,1
front desk staff were welcoming patient and helpful and clearly enjoyed their job it was a pleasant end of a long day,1
Anytime i come to this hotel i never get my deposit back will never come back again,0
The first room we were assigned was horrendous. There were so many things broken| tv| fixtures| etc. The second room had blood stained sheets and pillows that were not changed. The CSR| she was fabulous but this property was not what we expected for the price and hotel we chose. We told the csr upon checking out of our second dilemna and it didnt even bother them. Really disappointing.,0
The hotel room itself as well as location were fine but everything else wasn't. The elevators were incredibly slow and with only 3 of them| there aren't enough to serve 40 floors. Especially when entire flight crews are checking in and out on a regular basis. The walls inside the rooms are also paper thin and you can hear everything. There was one morning where a dog that was left inside someone's room barked constantly until people complained and hotel employees had to come and check it out. The service was also bad as I asked for towels at the 2nd floor reception and was told they had to be sent up and they never came and I was there for 2 more days after that. The location is the only thing worth praising as everything else is sub par.,0
Very clean and quite. Just little expensive for Snacks,1
I didnt like anything.  Due to covid rooms got cleaned days late and you had to leave the room.  I paid for a king bed and got a queen.,0
My stay was absolutely amazing.. the view was magical.. would definitely be going back.| thank you..,1
It was clean and the staff were nice and professional. For 1 night stay it was all i needed,1
I will keep this property in mind| good location and a clean comfortable room.  The staff was very friendly and professional| all normal for this brand.,1
At first I walked into a room that was dirty and never was cleaned upon my arrival| but than when I went downstairs to front desk. The Representative helped me get a new room after I showed her the video of the room I was supposedly staying,1
Great place to stay| nice workers| perfect cleaning comfort bed |good prices,1
Great location|reasonable  price been here a few times.,1
Great midweek get away. Trip to Liberty Island| downtown sights. We will definetly book agin.,1
I loved it| so clean. You all were so nice,1
As frequent New York visitors| we have stayed in many hotels. This has by far been the worst. From the stains on our bedsheets to the paper thin walls and disruptive neighbors| we tried to be in the hotel as little as possible. The hotel itself feels old and outdated. The elevators take forever and are ancient. Every time we requested something from room service we were directed to a different extension and then redirected in circles until we gave up and found solutions ourselves. The other guests were incredibly disruptive and rude. Do not recommend and will not be returning. Does not enhance your New York experience| just causes stress.,0
It had such a warm clear feeling and everyone was so nice and helpful,1
Room was dirty. Staff were disinterested. Overall a disappointing stay,0
They staff was very friendly and attentive| the room was all labeled and disinfected and all tidy,1
Great place. Great location. Felt very safe. Full of young kids though trying to party on weekends. Blasting music until 3am| until I finally called down.,1
This is an extremely reasonably priced hotel for NYC. The staff is always very friendly and the room clean. Best is that it is so close to the subway. Whenever we have an event in the city we stay here. It's a nice little get away.,1
I didn't like how small the room was. Very cramp like. I could hear people in their room from my room. The halls felt like I was in the projects or a motel that was fitted as a shelter.  I had to go to several different floors for ice because there wasn't any on the floor I was staying on.  There was no staff member at the desk where you go to buy water| so there was I guess a security guard trying to assist until someone showed up. The room was clean| though. The view from the room wasn't so great.  Couldn't connect to the WiFi.  I think it's pricey for the stay there. I wouldn't go back,0
They told us we needed ID for the card I was using for the security deposit. We had to leave and couldn't find a cab. How can I get my money back???,0
Room is very nice and comfortable definitely enjoy the view and everything was perfect,1
The staff were excellent especially Brian and Gio  ... The housekeeping guy (shortie) and that Italian restaurant dude is excellent - very good food. I WILL BE BACK - I want my room 4003! Amenities were very clean!,1
Great location and price! The staff was to the point!,1
My room shared a wall with a couple that talked non-stop from 11pm to 8am| believe it or not. Walls are paper thin si heard their whole damn conversation... phone from the room wasn't working to reach front desk. Since I booked through Expedia| the hotel was unable to refund me for the most horrible night I've spent at a hotel. I'll definitely avoid staying here in the future.,0
Bad service,0
It was clean| the staff were nice. The room view was amazing. Never disappointed by this hotel,1
Check in was strange being on he 2nd floor as oppose to upon entry. Elevator was too small and the wait long for the elevator. Overall the hotel was clean.,1
Overall for me it was a great experience and had a great time staying at the doubletree hotel i would strongly recommend anyone to stay there great view great location great people and all for a great price,1
Rooms are small but I enjoyed the shower. Bed sheets had stains and so dod the bed. No room service because of covid but thats to be expected. People in check in were nice though. Wouldnt give this place a 4/5 but maybe 3-3.5/5,1
The hotel was clean and close to all love the view. The room modern m clean bathroom tight but clean Only 1 roll of toilet paper and 1 soapThe fridge was a drawer in the table very small but uniqueThe view gorgeous but the light was tooo bright on the morning.. curtains didn't help No housekeeping no breakfast items available only at front desk ... market and check in same attendant ... sooo had to wait 20 mins to buy a sandwich and juice,1
Best hotel I've been to yet. The staff was amazing & always available. Free complementary upgrade to a city view as well as delicious cookies. The room was small but clean with an amazing shower. Close to restaurants & pharmacy.,1
Great price| clean room and environment. Safe precautions in place.,1
It was great!,1
Upon arrival there were issues on the parking situation| I understand it was from an independent group but the waiting time| the lack of help was really disappointing. In addition| the room wasn't really cleaned well and felt lacking to the normal doubletree Hilton standard. Also| pretty bummed about not having cookies here! Feeling like I spent way too much for lack of quality and care. I won't be referring this location to anyone.,0
It was ok| even with construction| there were a lot of young adults for some reason. They need microwaves in the rooms| and the phone in the room need to be fixed.,1
Awesome view of the WTC. Convenient location. Shops/ cafes/ pier 17,1
Terrible customer service relation and racist. Absence of social distance in the elevator. Elevator is about 3ftx3ft yet 5 people in inside at a time. No signage of social distance posted anywhere in the hotel. The worse| no parking space. You will pay extra $50 pee night for parking. No breakdast offerd with reservation. Very narrow hallway. The worst and most terrible hotel stay ever.,0
The first disappointment was when I booked the hotel there was an option to pay for the room alone| or book the option that includes a buffet breakfast. Traveling with 4 kids| I selected the rate that includes a buffet breakfast. I get to the hotel| and the women said there is no breakfast. Their only offering was a muffin| cup of fruit| and a juice. No sorry or anything. The second thing you notice is there is really no lobby. They are checking guest in through a booth| and you're pretty much waiting outside. There was alot of construction going on as well. Thirdly| the toilet stopped working in our room| and the front desk clerk moved us to another room. However| when we walked into the new room it was already occupied by other guest. Now me and our kids are downstairs in the outside lobby in our pajamas waiting for another room. The clerk at first couldn't find a room with two beds as they were supposedly all booked. So I'm like a hotel with 40 plus rooms. You don't have 1 room available with two beds to fit me and my kids. I was utterly disgusted with the hotel and staff. The staff acted so non-nonchalant as if they really don't care what you have to say| or what your concerns are. Long story| short| I would never stay at this hotel ever again! I visit NY alot| but this place would never be option any longer.,0
The room was very small and as well as the entry way,0
Beside the construction thats still going on in the building. I had to change rooms because the first room was dirty| the glass door for the shower was broke off and there was glass shards on the floor and there was light bulbs left sitting on the side of the sink. The second room i was given was clean but didnt have any of the toiletries and the phone in the room didnt work i had to go all the way down stairs to tell them and i was on the 38th floor,0
The property is still under renovation and construction....plus no tv guide nor a bottle water in the room...very disappointed,1
The toilet did not flush| missing toiletries| building undergoing construction/renovation  which should have been mentioned during booking. An overall bad experience that has soured me on Doubletree and will no longer recieve my business.,0
Bed sheets were dirty| no sheet under comforter that is used for every guest| fridge was broken in one of the rooms we had. The other fridge only fit 3 bottles ( normal size).  Most times no towels or wash cloths. Front desk lady's always have a attitude. The building should be shut down right now honestly| they're redoing everything and it looks bad. I went on a Monday paid for city view and supposedly ‚Äúthey were booked up in my room type in the best city view floors‚Äù when I went there| there were a handful of guests. Every other door was still taped shut. ALSO PARKING is $40 small car & it's$45 each time you go to park! You can't just go get your car go get something to eat and park again! You'll have to pay!! & street parking is beyond ridiculous to find| my family and I almost checked out right away because it was so difficult!  Would not recommend.,0
Even though it seems the hotel was under some type of renovation or construction in the check in area| the lady at the front desk was very helpful & informative. Also my room was very clean & comfortable I had a great view of the twin tower.,1
I reserved this room for my sister because she had been driving 36 hours. I paid with my card. Everything was confirmed. When she got there she was told that she needed a card with $50 to get the room. That was not stated in any terms when booking. She was not able to get the room so she had to sleep in her car. Very upset. Would like my refund since my sister was never able to stay there per an employee at that location.,0
Overall pretty good| although a heads up over renovation would have been needed.,1
It was clean. The A/C had artic mode and it was comfortable.,1
The hotel was under a renovation| elevators are the worst| the workers don't respect social distancing and go into the elevator with the guests all the time.,1
It was awesome I enjoyed it,1
Great location and great staff. Room was clean and great view,1
This hotel is a very comfortable place to stay. The mattress| floor| bedding| walls| bathroom are very clean. I stood on the 38 floor in a king size bed and the view looking out into the water was beautiful! The N| W| R| 4| and 5 trains are up the block and right around the corner. The only thing I would change is they used a sheet for the based of the bed instead a fitted sheet. House keeping need to be better at putting a fitted sheet on the bed. I did not received their warm chocolate cookie.overall I would stay there again.,1
Room I reserved wasn't available| Breakfast wasn't available even though I purchased it with my room. this not a 4star it's more like a 2 star I was very disappointed.,0
Elegant once you get to the seond floor and the nice view out the window,1
Didn't look or feel clean. Reception was rude.Didn't have extra pillow cases. We wanted to change ours cause they looked like they hadn't been changed.,0
Beautiful View of downtown!  Beds are comfy! Room is clean!,1
I loved the service and the redesigned rooms. Beds were comfortable and room service was great!,1
"Staff was very friendly. I booked it thinking that breakfast was included. When I did the search for the hotel I selected ""breakfast included"" in the filters so I was disappointed when I realized that it was not.",1
Over all very nice....only issue is often took for forever to catch elevator to go up or down.,1
No parking and no free breakfast. I have paid around $500 without free food.,0
Insanely huge flat screen tv with free premium movie channels. Partial view of the river. Lots of space in the room. Free cookies and bottled water at check in. Wifi works great. Conveniently located for the WTC memorial. Very good access to transport links| including light rail to Hoboken and Brooklyn is just over the bridge. Would stay again.,1
Everything was good but it was cold in the building. We adjusted the heat in the room and that worked fine but the halls and elevators were cold,1
The property was nice but small and felt a bit dated.  The staff was wonderful and helpful.  The only issue we had was that the elevators were very slow and with the height of that building| it was inconvenient.,1
Good location for me. Not enough elevators. Very clean,1
Customer service was excellent. Great location steps away from the subway and near main attractions.,1
Great property! Wonderful staff! Hotel was very clean.,1
Great location; pillows were way too mushy; and mattress was very squishy,1
No bar or lounge in hotel. No refrigerator in rooms. No continental breakfast.,1
the rooms are very clean. i was kinda disappointed that the room did not come with a tub.,1
Beds comfy| location to food excellent| many choices to chill and have a drink. Subway very close. Room was cozy. Bathroom a little small-shower hot. Could have been cleaned better small mold in shower. Bed super comfy. Tv Great quality and lots of channels. Other reviews had slow elevator we did not encounter that problem. Staff was super friendly.,1
Great location and staff. The room was never really cleaned well| but other than that| it was great.,1
Stayed here numerous times. It has an excellent location| has very clean and comfortable accommodations with courteous staff. Only downside are the extremely slow elevators.,1
Perfect for a weekend foodie trip. wow! So happy with the hotel location and free breakfast was amazing!!!!,1
Nice hotel. Well located   Would recommend and would return,1
The property is in a good location. The staff are friendly courteous. And check in was a breeze. Over all a great experience so far. The rooms are very small but modern and updated. The only downside was due to the small size of the room there were no work desk to setup and work from my laptop,1
Horrible! Had a death in my family| made a hotel reservation and had to cancel. The hotel was booked| and even with my reason they would not give me my money back. But even better... they told me if i cancelled I would be charged for ANOTHER night. Great service!,0
Hotel is in the perfect location for subway access| statue| Brooklyn Bridge| Wall Street and World Trade. The room is perfect. Beds are comfortable. Only down side was the elevators. They were extremely slow but that is to be expected due to time of year.,1
Very clean and made check in and out super easy. The entry way is small| but they were very helpful when we needed to know where to navigate ourselves in the city as well.,1
Rooms were clean| breakfast was good and subway was across the street,1
This was a great hotel for our weekend visit to NYC. It was a bit away from what we wanted to do but the close train stations made traveling a lot easier. It was also in a quieter area which was nice. The room was very clean and every staff member that we interacted with was very kind and helpful. The bed that we got was incredibly comfortable and made it difficult to want to get up in the morning. Overall| we would stay here again! It was priced fairly compared to other hotels near it. The only things that were less than satisfactory were how slow and small the elevators were and there was no microwave or mini fridge. I know the rooms were small but they definitely could've fit them. With over 40 floors| the 3 elevators took forever when you called them. It was very awkward when it stopped on other floors to pick other people up but there wasn't enough room for them to get on. They could only fit about 5 people comfortably without any luggage or bags.,1
"I booked this hotel for an employee for business travel. Upon a late arrival at 10pm at the hotel| he was informed that the hotel had actually overbooked rooms and did not have accommodations for him. Instead| he was sent to another hotel of poorer quality. We did not pay a cheap price tag for this room. I've tried getting in touch with both the hotel and hotels.com about the trouble but have yet to hear an answer-back. I did not even know that such service was even possible from a Hilton hotel. Be aware when booking here| at least through hotels.com. I'm always confident booking through the service for the ""Guaranteed Room"" promise...but this was far from the case.",0
Staff service great and place was well cleaned and organized  Subway station up front of hotel and many good places walking distance.  Great location,1
Our stay was awful - the thermostat was broken and kept changing the heat| the bed was so small and old we kept rolling into the middle and we were put in a disabled room where the shower head sprayed everywhere and was broken. Would never stay here again.,0
Everything was great,1
Price paid should include breakfast.Not enough lifts for a hotel of this size.  Long waits for lift.,1
Very nice! In the past I've only stayed in Midtown| but I'd definitely choose this hotel again. It's a 20 min train ride from Times Square but it was nice to get away from the chaos. Very accommodating- arranged adjoining rooms for me and a family member| gave great recommendations on nearby restaurants. I found others' comments about slow elevators to be false. We never had a problem.,1
The rooms are pretty small but hey it's New York. Besides that it was a pretty nice stay.,1
It was a goog hotel to stay in New York finicial district| easy to get around the city and to enjoy New York,1
I love the hotel| the rooms the lobby the staff were amazing. My only Negative is the elevators were a bit slow at times and overworked for the size of the hotel. It was obvious that they weren't all running at the same time. I would've preferred some fresh fruit to be available in your little lobby store and the gluten free cookies. Otherwise I love this place and I'll very likely stay again.,1
Nice hotel.  The rooms are small and the elevators are slow at rush hour.  It is an NYC hotel so I guess that is to be expected.,1
Lovely| friendly and helpful staff. Major drawback is that there are only 3 elevators serving about 44 floors and seemingly no dedicated service elevator either. Wait times to get to and from our room were high.,1
we received an exceptional welcome from staff| and they let us check in early because room was available which was great. the staff was very nice and helpful. thanks,1
Excellent service. Staff was attentive and courteous. Would highly recommend this hotel.,1
Good hotel in a great location. The one drawback are their elevators| with 3 elevators servicing both customers and staff across 40 floors you have to plan for lots of wait time| particularly during peak hours.,1
Hotel was relatively clean| aside from the room service tray with leftover food that was left sitting in the hallway for days. Rooms are EXTREMELY small| much smaller than other nyc hotels I've stayed in. Elevator situation is just unacceptable. We had to walk down the stairs and carry our luggage down with us. There was a bridal party staying in the 32nd floor that had to walk down and up the stairs. I won't be staying here again.,0
Only stayed for one night so I didn't see much else of the property other than the lobby and my room. One thing to note and this goes to Doubletree as a whole.... please bake chocolate chip cookies with no nuts. There are entirely too many people with nut allergies now for Doubletree to bake cookies with nuts. The gluten free cookies are ok| but they're not the warm classic cookies Doubletree is known for.,1
It's much than what we thought. Room and bathroom are small but manageable. Clerk from the counter was very nice and helpful. Reception locates at 2nd floor. Elevators are kind of busy but waiting time is not too bad. This is really location walking distance to many hot spots.,1
Waited a while for my room but got free breakfasts as compensation.  Otherwise everything was excellent.  Would definitely consider coming back.,1
The room was very clean and comfortable. Bed was comfortable and bedding was very nice. The bathroom was very nice and clean as well. The only problem we encountered was the delay on the elevator. They had 3 elevators but only two of them were really working.  The staff also used the same elevators so it took longer to get to our room and down to the street.  We stay on foor 18 and unfortunately the person I traveled with has a walking disability so taking the stairs was not an option for us.  Other than that the hotel is a great location easy access to the metro and other shops.  Great walking distance to see the fireworks (our visit was during the 4th of July). The hotel is also environmentally friendly by saving energy.  Lights| ac ect only work when key hard is inserted. They also participate in water conservation efforts by giving guest the option to reuse their towels and not replacing the linen daily. Great experience and would definitely recommend to others.,1
"Although I've visited New York many times| I've always lodged in New Jersey.  This was my first time staying in the city and I was very surprised.  Everything was so small and compact.  It took a day or so to get use to the ""smallness"".  However| everything ended up being okay.",1
Great location and a good price.  Clean| and the staff was very nice,1
The staff was very accommodating and the room was cozy and super clean!,1
The location great | close to many attractions Housekeeping horrible | they don't clean well,0
We came here for a two night stay during Labor Day weekend. Everything was great for our stay. The room (1 King Bed - City View) was not big| but it was bigger than what I expected considering the amount of rooms and size of the hotel. This was my first time staying in Lower Manhattan and I really enjoyed it. It's very quiet at night. My main concern about this hotel was the elevator situation after reading all of the negative reviews about it. Elevator problems ended up being a non-issue for us. There are only three elevators| which I can understand is a problem to some people. Our room was on the 37th floor (hotel has 44 total floors) and the longest we waited for an elevator during our entire stay was about 4 minutes. Other than that| we essentially were in an elevator less than a minute after pressing the button. They also move extremely fast from floor to floor| which was a surprise to me because I read reviews about them being slow. It was a holiday weekend so I figured it would take a while to get in the elevators| but again it was not a problem for us. Either we got lucky or we're very easy to please. The stay overall was great and the hotel was quiet. One thing to note: from our city view room on floor 37| we had a view directly at the World Trade Center| but it was a bit obstructed by other buildings. So don't expect the best view.,1
Staff are really nice! But the room is a little bit out dated.  Also| my 17month was climbing on the nightstand| I didn't realize it wasn't secured to the headboard| so it fell on her and she has a scratch on her face.,1
Clean| updated. Friendly staff. Great location. Good price,1
Centrally located| subway station within walking distance,1
Perfect location| place| comfortable!  Very easy access to subways| dining| lower Manhattan.,1
There was no refrigerator in the room. You have to rent one at extra cost. What kind of Mickey Mouse organization is this?,0
Very nice property! Great location. Rooms a little smaller than usual but its NYC! Id stay again,1
Nice location for business in the financial district. My only real beef was on the slowness of the elevators and lack of A/C (no A/C in the elevator shafts at all) although i definitely did not find the staff particularly hospitable.,1
Elevator situation was ridiculous. Long waits| very small| many times the door would open and the can was full. And the checkin being on the wedond floor was very inconvenient.,0
Great place|great location. Super view from our room,1
Hotel is centrally located at the NY Financial District.  Close to restaurants and transportation.,1
Great location near subways.  Close to Statue of Liberty| bull and stock exchange. Amazing views from the rooms (freedom tower). Lacking amenities such as bathtub or fridge/microwave but makes up for it with location.  Elevator wait times can be frustrating during peak hours.  Quiet hotel| very nice staff.,1
great location but noisy;  air conditioning was not working properly started heating instead of cooling,1
Its in a nice location..walking distance to everything,1
Good area| close to most of the attraction we wanted to see and use.,1
Everything was perfect| just expect to wait for the elevators every time you need them.,1
Very accessible to the city.The views were fantastic the staff was very friendly. Plus cookies when checking in,1
I understand the compact nature of the hotel and recognize that with a smaller footprint per unit the style of the accommodations would have to be different from what yo normally get in a Double Tree. However that doesn't excuse:1. Little room to put out amenities in the washroom.2. The shelf that is provided is small and not set perpendicular to the wall - as a result objects slide (fall off the shelf)3. An air - conditioner system that believes 71 degrees is a setting to reflect polar room temperatures and that setting it a 72 degrees is a signal to initiate heating the room4. A shower door that leaks like sieve - step out of the shower into a mini pool - this was reported to staff and essential no remedy provided.5. Finally - the water was turned off at mid-night on the first night - no warning - and when the desk was called - no explanation other that work was in progress. Given that the water was off - occupants should have been told to run the water the next morning to ensure any settling or dislodging of material in the system was removed.Negatives aside - the hotel is well situated from a tourist perspective. It is unfortunate that basic accommodations tends to downgrade what should be an excellent hotel located in an exceptional spot.,0
Elevator was broken. Employees said owners were aware and didn't care,0
The air condition is Bad,1
Left a tee shirt in the closet. Staff was unwilling to look for it.,1
"Cozy clean room| friendly staff| great value. ""Quiet"" part of Manhattan. Will consider staying here again and highly recommended",1
neat king bed room  and nice view few building /world trade center too. nice lobby .,1
Nice place| nice employees but the bathroom left a lot to be desired. Not enough room to change your mind! No room to store personal items while taking a shower! :),1
It may seem unfair to compare this hotel to others in the doubletree brand but I am. I've stayed at several doubletrees and this was by far the worst. I picked my stay based on my experiences at the other brand hotels. The service was terrible. The in-room orders for breakfast (by hanging the order in your door) were cancelled but no one explained that to us until we called about the missing breakfast. Late night staff was rude and unhelpful to inquiries about available supplies in the pantry area. And the elevator service is by far the worst I've ever experienced. Waited nearly 20 minutes for an elevator that wasn't packed or ‚Äúout of service‚Äù because staff was using it. Best part of the stay was the location.,0
The only thing I did not like was the fact that each floor only had one double room and it is located directly across from the elevator.  Otherwise| it was a clean| comfortable property with a friendly| helpful staff.,1
Cookies! The people were great as well! The location was convenient!,1
Very professional service| accomodating. Bed was comfortable| room was okay| could have been cleaner and roomier and it didn't have a fridge or microwave. Lots of bars around that area which I wasn't expecting. Close to the bay| World Trade Center| seaport district.,1
The room and bathroom was very small and compact.  Not enough room to stretch out.  One of my lights over the bed didnt work.  Part of ceiling was coming down in the bathroom.  42 in flat screen was great and the cookies.,0
My boyfriend and I loved our stay at the DoubleTree! We had a standard room with a king and it was beautiful| clean| and pretty quiet! It was also in a great location; close to subway stations and various attractions. Overall we had a great stay and would love to come back.,1
Bed was so comfortable- property overall was a bit run down,1
Staff was helpful and accommodating. They were very welcoming. As an Honors member| they made me feel extra special.,1
The air conditioner made too much noise otherwise it was great,1
It was great| just you need to be potion with elevators.,1
Lacked some basic room amenities. Didn't have a fridge or microwave. Lacked an ironing board. The bathroom was very small.,0
Great location| close to subway station| walkable to 911 memorial park and battery park.,1
Clean| comfortable hotel. Easy check in. Great Location: Two blocks from the Dead Rabbit and the 1train.,1
Great location to get around the tourist places.  Elevator wait was a bit long.,1
Room was ok. Rather than a city view I got a building view. Hair on bathroom floor and on toilet. Requested extra towels but never got them. Staff was friendly though,1
Difficult to access on a day when there were road closures due to a local festival.  We had to park far away.  Only 2 elevators for 40 client floors led to long elevator waits.  Breakfast not included.  Room was very nice.  Bathroom tiny but functional.  It was fine but I probably would not stay again.  I know if a nearby hotel that is cheaper and includes breakfast.  I was expecting more from a Hilton.,1
Check in was ridiclously slow and rude| elevators were terrible--one wait was almost 1/2 hour,0
This is NY so of course we didn't spend much time at the hotel.  We just needed a nice quiet place to sleep each night and we got it here. Will definitely stay here again.,1
Didn't like the time waiting for the elevator.  We had a city view| not much of a view.  Staff was great!!  Room was clean.,1
Good hotel. Good location. Financial district| Manhattan.,1
Hotel is currently renovating. Good location in the Financial District of Manhattan.,1
Stayed for two nights| great amenities and even better staff!,1
Comfortable overnight stay close to various points of interest with lots of restaurants nearby.,1
My wife and I were celebrating her birthday in NYC and stayed at the hotel for 2 nights. The room was very clean and the bed was comfy. We especially appreciated the fact that they allowed us to leave our baggage prior to checking in and after we checked out so that we could further explore NYC which was very generous. We can't wait to plan our next trip and highly recommend this hotel.,1
Hotel and staff were great. great quiet location too with close proximity to subway lines. Elevators were a bit slow.,1
Location and cleanliness. Elevators were HORRIBLY slow,1
From the check in - to check out - Great experience. The cookies were warm| and delicious (don't let the other miserable reviewers fool u.)Room was clean and updated| staff was great. Great view - will definitely recommend and revisit.,1
Great location. Good service by the staff. Hotel needs an update - small rooms are crowded for 2 people.,1
Rude check in never again so upsetting and frustrating,0
no webcasting on the tv. Need better technology to setup the entertainment system.,1
From 2am to 5am there was a domestic violence disturbance involving hotel guests| hotel staff and NYPD. Doubletree promised to refund me the room cost due to the disturbance but have not done so.,0
Great visit. Front desk staff was welcoming and helpful with even the smallest question.,1
Lack of elevators| waiting time to get up 35 floors was excessive. Couldn't get into our room. Had to wait for electrician to open our room and then wait while he had to go get new batteries for lock. Wait for new key cards. Bathroom hadn't been cleaned. Dry urine on toilet seat. Floor was dirty. Mirror was dirty. Sink was dirty. Disappointing for sure given the cost of room. Support staff were all kind and hard working.,0
It's a clean small room in a greatbarea of town. Easy to get on the subway to midtown and uptown| etc.,1
Had a great time. The hotel was very clean. If you are looking to party this is NOT the area. Close train so you can get around.,1
Staff is great. Everyone I came in contact with was very welcoming and willing to help. The only thing is parking can get expensive| but it's New York!,1
Location was good for trip. Room was a lot smaller than expected. Construction all around building. Room was quite. Tv channels very limited,1
Comfort was neutral bc no hot shower first day.   But| thank you for correcting it for the next morning.,1
i love everything about this property just amazing ...all employees was just great and was a pleasant to meentthem they gave me a pleasurable greeting with a special cookie,1
my first stay here and I was only here overnight.  I would only suggest that it is more clearly labeled that you have to go to the 2nd floor for the front desk.  It was nice a gentleman was there letting folks know but if he wasn't there I would have been lost.  In fact as I was leaving I noticed folks standing there wondering what to do. I advised them they had to select the 2nd floor.,1
Friendly and hospitable front desk service and greeter.,1
Great location! Arrived in JFK in the early morning| and then took the subway to the hotel. Once I got off the subway| we were literally right by the Charging Bull| and about a 3 minute walk to the hotel. Once we got into the hotel| we were greeted immediately and offered to store our luggage. We were then told to proceed to the 2nd floor so that we could let the front desk know about our arrival| since it was too early to check in. Front desk was polite and quick. We were told that I would receive a text from the hotel when the room is ready| and we might not have to wait for the 3pm check in. I got a text from the hotel around 1pm| which was great because we were so tired! I really liked that they allowed us to  get our room earlier.,1
Nina| our check in person was so wonderful!  Tolld her that ny daughter and biyfriend were going to get engaged that evening and she went out of her way to make it a great experience. We will go back!,1
Room was great| but the elevators at this hotel are appalling. Average wait time for an elevator during busier periods is 5-10 minutes| and they were all working!,0
The bathroom wasn't great. The shower was super hot and didn't stay when you turned it down.,1
Nice room and view.  Good location to catch ferry or a bite to eat,1
I only stayed one night| but the room was well appointed and the bed was comfortable. My only complaint is that the elevators were small and extremely slow| so it they always over-crowded.,1
Amazing!! Great location| very quiet area| and excellent service!,1
The hotel itself was very clean and a great location. Rooms were small but that was to be expected in NYC. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Downside: the room was so hot no matter what temperature we set the thermostat at and there was no exhaust system in the bathroom. However| I would return and stay there again if in NYC.,1
I Liked everything about this hotel| the staff was great and the place was great. It has a great Italian restaurant on the ground floor and a cool bar next door.,1
Good location with nice rooms. Didn't spend much time at the hotel so can't comment on amenities,1
nice comfortable  room / near many sight seeing places my grandsonand I wanted to see for the first time,1
Obstructed view but still great!,1
Lovely hotel| very welcoming and accommodating staff. Good location with many restaurants and shops nearby. Only downfall is the lifts| you can be waiting for some time.,1
The hotel was everything you would expect from a Double Tree. The staff is what made our experience great. We did not realize that the lobby was on the second floor. We were helped multiple times by different employees. The fitness room was great and had everything we needed. The only thing this hotel lacks is more elevators. Ask to be placed in a lower level because elevators take a while to come down from the higher levels. Again| every staff member we met from the staff behind the lobby desk| the maintenance people| and the luggage person on the first floor were all lovely.,1
Great location close to Wall Street| the Ferry| Charging Bull| subway and the 9/11 memorial. First time in New York so first time in a tiny room but enough space for a king bed and room to walk around.  Staff very helpful and polite.,1
Nice location to subway| World Trade Center and Statue of Liberty. Near by restaurants were a good selection and the hotel was nicely accommodated as you would expect with a double tree. All staff were very friendly and helpful.,1
You never knew elevators could be a problem until you stay here. Rooms are good| staff tries to help. Big problem is the elevators. 3 for 44 floors. It really sucks waiting for an elevator. Happened at all the busy times. Was a mess.,0
Good location close to the subway and Financial District. Room was comfortable and clean. Elevators tended to get backed up and certain times of day| and the front desk staff can be distracted and slow| but otherwise it's a good| mid-priced option.,1
Stay was easy to check in and room was clean.  Always have an issue with the elevators.  They take forever.,1
Nice hotel| and a wonderful staff. Would stay there again.,1
Good for a business trip| nice and clean. Service was nice. Room was smaller than expected and elevators were inconvenient at times. Not so great if this were for a vacation.,1
stayed one night so we could do the Ellis Island tour| found the hotel very convenient and customer friendly. From The doormen to the front desk clerks|we found them very helpful! The only downfall I found was the fact they don't have a refrigerator in the room. Other than that I found the hotel a nice place to stay,1
First time coming to NY ans as soon as i entered the hotel| the valet was the first point of contact.  Amazing welcome there and at the front desk| our check in was at 4pm and we reached around 1. The agent quickly check and offered us a free upgrade to a room that was already ready.  Rooms were great and spotless.  Definitely a 4 star property.  Will come back soon!,1
Room was larger than we expected.  Very clean.  Great view in every high room.   Staff were exceptional.  Easy access to subway.   We would definately stay here again.,1
I enjoyed my stay at the hotel. Could have been perfect if the room came with a (small) fridge.,1
Dreadful hotel.  Rooms are small and bathroom is extremely small. NO storage in the bathroom and NO counter space.  The WiFi was terrible.  I was on the phone at least 4 times for a minimum of 25 minutes each time getting the connection reset.  I will NEVER stay at this hotel again!,0
Will never stay here again.  Entrance is hidden; walked past it 3 times!  Very unattractive entrance on ground floor.  3 elevators for a 40 story building.  Wait| wait| wait.  Small room with 2 double beds.  Bathroom clean but tiny.  No place to hang anything - no hooks except one on back of door.  No shelves in bathroom to place anything.  We were given two plastic cups in the main room.  That was it.  Toilet paper roll was so close to the toilet that it required some gymnastics to take tissue from the roll.  The shampoo container was the smallest I've ever seen in a hotel.  And| only one of them provided...for 3 people.  I am surprised that Hilton would put its name on this place.  Oh| and Wi-Fi was awful; connections dropped frequently.,0
(Place was sold recently| was way better before),0
Very close to subway to Brooklyn. One stop. Near cute area of historic bars and restaurants.,1
The wifi was bad and there was a fire alarm at 3 in the morning!,0
Where to start? The elevator thats constantly out of service which means it takes ypu 20 minutes to get downstairs from your room. The false alarm fire alarm at 230am| then 20 minutes before receiving instructions to come downstairs for no good reason. Maybe if this was a real emergency we would have been in real trouble with the knowledge to handle such a situation properly.  Then of course having to wait a half hour for the elevator to get back up to my room with my 2-year old daughter which i had to wake up for no reason. Good luck getting her back to sleep at 3am.Explain to me how a hotel chain such as Hilton not have a crib on sit? Seriously showed up to the room in a pack n play for new borns.All in all one of the worst experiences ive ever had at a hotel.  Thank goodness it was only for 2 nights. Cant express how disapppinted i am in my experience. Knowing all of this| no one offered any kind of compensation for all the inconveniences. Cant recommend this hotel to anyone and i dont think i would ever stay at a hilton again.,0
the elevators were being repaired and I waited over 40 minutes in the hallway| which was not air conditioned repeatedly for 4 days.  It was a horrible experience.,0
Unprofessional staff at checking.Unacceptable elevator wait. 1/3 elevator down.Very noisy room. Noisy a/c and noisy water pipes.,0
Wifi was non functional (one bar); the phones in the rooms did not work; the television barely worked (picture was fuzzy); it took my parents hours to check in because a pipe burst on their floor; one of the elevators was broken so only one elevator was servicing 45 floors; overall very disappointing. I've stayed in better 1 star hotels in developing countries. Would not stay here again.,0
Only issue we had was due to an out of service elevator. It caused quite a few delays but the staff was kind and informative regarding the matter.,1
Right in the heart of Wall Street|,1
Close to 911 museum and other attractions in lower Manhattan. Also close to subway.,1
Great location near the 9/11 memorial and restaurants,1
The elevators is a real problem| had to wait a long time every time I needed the elevator.,1
Great location in the financial district in lower Manhattan. Walking distance to Wall St.| 911 Memorial| the ferry to the Statue of Liberty and more!,1
Third time stayed there very good.,1
Great hotel right next to financial district and Battery Park.Rooms are very comfortable and quite spacious for the city.,1
The position is very convenient| but dust in the room and the hair drier is dirty and sticky,1
Clean and good quality hotel| spacious rooms in NY scale. Sightseeing locations require a subway which is close by. The hotel has a good wifi and the gym is decent for a hotel gym (barbells but no bench press or bar). The rooms were much nicer than I have seen in any midtown hotel which cost more. I would definitely come again to this hotel.,1
A walking distance from the Staten Island ferry and the start of NYC Marathon. Very convenient with plenty of food options around.,1
Great stay would love to come back,1
Very clean and quiet. Comfortable. All staff polite and helpful. Would definitely stay there again!,1
The rooms were nice and spacious.  The bathroom was spacious.  The hotel is near many eateries| so you can walk to nearby delis.  24 hour valet!  You want to go| you can leave in 10 minutes!  Front desk was excellent and housekeeping was very attentive to our schedules.,1
Everything was great| service| location| cleanliness. Only problem was a constant sound of the vent in the bathroom. After a while we got used to it but I wouldn't stay in the deluxe king again but definitely come back to the hotel. We loved it!,1
Great location. The staff was very nice and accommodating. The room was nice and clean| and the beds were very comfortable. Overall a very nice experience.,1
I think you are lucky to have the staff that you have!  Everyone is being asked to work harder- with fewer staff members.  I HOPE you are paying them well!  From housekeeping to waiters to front desk-they ALL were giving it that extra effort!,1
Room very clean. Building seems new or renovated. Great location.,1
Had a great overnight stay. Got to,1
We had a nice stay. Check in was extremely smooth and very comfortable beds. The only downside was that we were charged a mandatory $25 fee   tax after the fact. I guess it's on their site| but we booked through Orbitz so we didn't know about it.,1
Great choice for Brooklyn,1
No cleaning service.. I still left a tip tho.,0
I loved my stay at the Hilton Brooklyn. The staff was very accommodating to our needs. I will definitely stay here again.,1
We had a very pleasant experience at Hilton. It was neat and clean. Staff was very nice and friendly.,1
Rude Housekeepper| very confusing resort fees| operating hours of bar atrocious.,0
Very nice staff. They were helpful & courteous,1
Great location for us.,1
Cleanliness and responsive staff were highlights as well as the best Manhattan's mixed at the bar!,1
Convenient lobby for check in.  Spacious rooms| cleanliness.,1
Front desk staff was terrible and unprofessional.,0
Very convenient location| nearby restaurants and shopping and I like the key feature to use the elevator you must have a room key.,1
The rooms were so dirty and gross. Are room smelled of smoke and had cigarette burns in the carpet and chairs. One of the chairs in the room had large smelly stain on it. The whole floor smelled of cigar and cigarette smoke| even though it was a non smoking hotel. We changed rooms and there were black hairs all over the linens a pillows| the sheets were stained. Really gross.,0
The beds were so comfortable and I slept like a baby,1
The hotel had a clean look and feel. Breakfast was well prepared and tasty. Bed was a bit too soft for our preference| a little firmer might have been better| as we sunk in and woke up with a backache.,1
I didn't like service at the front desk| the guy wasn't professional. I expected something more. I've been traveling around the globe for last 10 years| and have been in many Hilton hotels in Abu Dhabi| Seoul| Kuala Lumpur and so on. I asked for late check out| and was told that exactly today they don't do late check out. So I had to book another hotel,0
I have always had a pleasant experience staying at the downtown Hilton.,1
Very convenient very clean staff is wonderful Will stay again very soon,1
I lost my precious Rolex watch in the room and it was never found or returns to me by hotel staff. They claimed they never found it.,0
"Two issues were present with this hotel. First| the rampent drug use was an issue and caused us to need to change rooms through our stay into what felt like a downgraded smaller room. Second| an ""urban destination"" charge was added to my stay and not clarified to me until checkout. The more frustrating part of this experience is that I was told at checkout that I could have applied this $25 a day fee towards food at the hotel. The employee told me that I should have been notified of this at check-in| however| I was not notified of this. Had I known that I would have eaten at the hotel and saved myself on takeout costs. Honestly| the evasive practices of this hotel were frustrating on top of the the other issues.",0
It was alright,1
My stay was comfy! The front desk rep Rick went above and beyond to help me!,1
I like that it was Kind of secluded in Brooklyn. I like going to places that aren't in the middle of too much traffic and this was perfect.,1
Easy check in| clean rooms| decent gym and close to shopping and restaurants,1
The hotel was pristine and the room was spacious. The bar service was okay. The drink were average nothing special. The food was surprisingly good.,1
Room was amazing. Service great. Only issue I had was in the bathroom| a bar of open soap and toiletries were left in the shower on the soap holder. You see something like that its a turn off and it makes one question if the room was properly cleaned| especially in these times.,1
The Hotel was quiet. The rom was clean.  Their was no Microwave in the room.  Will stay there on my nest trip to Brooklyn Ny,1
Hotel room was nice and clean and staff was polite and helpful | super close to shopping and restaurants | enjoyed my stay definitely will come again,1
Friendly| helpful staff; but still think room could have been better maintained. Window shade broken on arrival was immediately fixed| but on my last morning| right before checking out| saw broken glass shards behind bathroom sink.,1
There was no room service| and there were multiple things wrong with the room. The fridge was broken| the doorknob was as well| and the bed was uncomfortable.,0
Very good location. Large room and comfortable executive lounge. Very good service.,1
Great location in Brooklyn.  Good parking facilities,1
It was cool. The bathroom floors were cold.,1
"Here's why I gave a poor rating.  Hilton| like many hotels| is now using phoney charges on top of the quoted rates.  On this stay| Hilton created a ""Urban Destination Charge"" of $25.00 per day. With taxes| this comes to $28.69 per day. These charges are theft| they aren't quoted in the daily rate and are only disclosed when you check in.  Nonsense!!!",1
We stayed here for a show at barclay venter and reviews said it was right around the corner but it is a 30 minute walk.  Found parking on street so disnt have to pay for valet but they charge a $25 resort fee per day so be aware of that added fee!,1
Great location|  will stay again for sure  a lot of businesses close by,1
So glad we chose this hotel| it was perfect! Close to shops| train (and easy transfer to New York| 7 stops to mid town). Manhattan was crazy busy and so nice to come back to Brooklyn. Close and uber to Williamsburg to visit| a must. Gospel church (amazing experience) on the next block. Rooms were good size. Really loved our time here.,1
the only problem was the TV reception for CBS for the Patriots-Titans game.  It was very blurry.  All the other channels were fine but CBS.  So we went downstairs to the bar and there the picture was clear but no sound.  The policy is not to have sound in the bar. Really? Tough to watch a playoff game without sound.,1
Hilton is trying to screw customers by adding bogus fees and supposed taxes to the final bill. They created an ‚ÄúUrban Fee‚Äù of $25.00 per night and two minor taxes for about $5.00 more each night. I was told they were to be removed when I complained at checkin| but they were there at checkout. There's a reason they let people just leave the hotel these days| so they can rip you off. Always check out and ask for the final statement! The hotel also charges $300 for incidentals and takes three days after checkout  to issue a credit so they have had my cash for over a week before they return it. My room was not clean when it was finally available. The property is nice| room design and bathrooms are nice| location is good. If they weren't rip-off artists| I would return| it  but Hilton's added fees and dishonesty is something I can't accept. Find another hotel.,0
Need to have bell man to help with luggage from street to lobby or room.,1
Enjoyed the stay| very good price as compared to stating the city. Subway easily accessible.,1
Clean| modern| beautiful| polite people| tried to do everything to accommodate us. And do try the food at the restaurant onsite!,1
Love the beds at the Hilton. But there was a lot of banging. I think it was the cabinets in the room where they keep the fridge. Fridge doors banging off the cabinet doors. I suggest taking the cabinet doors off.,1
I was here overnight on a business trip in early December.  The hotel was very nice| the bed was comfortable| and the room was spacious and clean.  The buffet breakfast in the morning was very good and was included as a $25 free credit provided at check-in to the hotel's bar and restuarant.  One complaint of mine is that concierge did not let me know that my parking voucher from the affiliated self-park garage had to be validated before my departure.  The garage refused to honor the $30 flat rate for overnight parking even after presentation of a hotel receipt.  The arrogant employee said I had to return to the hotel to get my ticket stamped even through I provided clear evidence of my stay.  Needless to say| nobody has the time or patience to be walking up and down NYC blocks on a weekday winter morning to dispute parking charges.  Hilton needs to be clear with their guests about how their parking arrangements work or they should become affiliated with the parking establishment in closest proximity to the hotel.,1
We enjoyed our stay.  Staff was helpful. Room service was excellent.  The only issue I had was with the charges for valet parking.  I dropped my car off on Monday night at 9pm and picked it up on Tuesday at 12.30 pm.  I was charged for two days of parking. It may be correct technically| but seems unfair to me.,1
Great hotel| location and service with convenient self parking and food options nearby. Highly recommended if you need to be in downtown Brooklyn.,1
My stay here was amazing. The staff was super friendly and remembered my name each time I came to the lobby.,1
Everything's truly great EXCEPT the lobby area could use a free coffee bar/table for folks staying at the hotel.,1
I was pleasantly surprised at how great the staff/room was! Hilton continues the tradition of elegant hotels.,1
very large room. good location| near lots of shopping.,1
Pretty standard hotel experience| the room was huge| lobby area was nice| elevators were very fast. Unfortunately| my time at this hotel was tainted by the very aggressive housekeeping staff (well| one woman in particular). She knocked on the door at 9am to asked when we would be leaving. I told her 11am (check out time). My friend left the room at 10:30am to catch a flight but I stayed behind|,1
I was satisfied and comfortable with the hotel stay. I did not like that I had to pay $55 for valet.,1
Location was good| close to shopping and subway,1
Beautiful| clean| spacious. We had a great stay. I'd highly recommend it to anyone,1
Staff wonderful helpful polite n always smiling n even remembered my name! The best hotel ever n I've stayed at many,1
Likes: spacious| well located Dislikes: shower over bath,1
Overall a great stay. We did have an issue when we asked to have our room serviced - the fellow who took the call was quite rude. We asked to speak with a Front Desk Manager| and she apologized and resolved the problem.,1
My stay was amazing and comfortable,1
This hotel has bed bugs. Please investigate!!,0
The gentleman who met us at check in was rude and dismissive. Lucky for him the rest of the desk staff and the bell boys were delightful or we would have changed hotels,1
It was amazing!,1
Very clean.  In the middle of everything. Friendly employees.,1
Great position for Brooklyn shops and subway to other parts of NY.,1
We enjoyed our stay and were very comfortable.  We didn't interact with the staff much as we were out most of the two days we were there.  When we did| they were very accommodating but very busy.  Maybe they were understaffed.,1
Really just to be alone  my everything| in our lives now we rearly get time like this.,1
Staff - very helpful| professional| excellent interpersonal skillsProperty- well located and attractive,1
I felt that room service should start earlier| so I had breakfast downstairs which I got a cup of coffee| a cup of scrambled eggs and some bacon|  it was $27.22 plus tip.  more than double room service and the guy followed me around like I was a criminal.  Had I know that it was going to cost me 30.00 for a little bit of egg and bacon I wouldn't have gotten it.  It wasn't worth it.  Disappointed in this.,1
The location was great for where i had to go. Nice bar area. Service in the restaurant at dinner was pleasant enough| but reallllly slowwww. The morning I checked out i just wanted a cup of coffee at the bar.  The guy never aknowledged me and finally i gave up after he served multiple patrons who came well after I did.,1
The hotel was fine| in line with other Hilton's. A perfectly fine business travel hotel. However| when traveling for work| the one thing you need is internet access.  The hotel offers free internet| but that free internet is sporadic at best. I mentioned it to the front desk and they offered no accommodation. I know I can pay an additional $15 per day to get what I suppose is more reliable internet| but when you are already paying several hundred dollars a night for a room| the free internet should at the very least work. It might be slower| but it should work. This did not. I wasted a half hour in the morning before a meeting trying to get connected| I only had one hour to prepare| with a similar issue the following days. I was there for three nights and wished I had stayed elsewhere so I would have been able to get some work done. I ended up using my phone as a hotspot| but the hotel also only had 1 bar or cellular signal so| the hotspot was very very slow.  For this reason alone| I would not stay here while traveling for business.,1
Wonderful stay.  Loved it. Will stay again for the right price. Thank you,1
Location and cleanliness . Central to a lot of things.,1
The only problem was the weather. It was extremely cold. I will visit a different time of the year. Hotel accommodations were good. Prices were very inflated and food service was not good.,1
Nice hotel| nothing especially fancy| but nice and clean and a HUGE room.,1
Location was great as we had a wedding to attend in Brooklyn.,1
Great property in great location| but what stood it apart was the staff.  ALL staff were attentive and friendly.  Really made a difference.,1
This property was in downtown Brooklyn and perfectly located. It was near several restaurants| subway| corner stores| the Fulton Mall| and the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir. It was a very nice facility with contemporary furniture.,1
Nicely updated.  Rooms and fitness center clean with good balance of weights and cardio options.  Convenient location in nice neighborhood.,1
The staff was courteous and very efficient. Service was of a high standard. Bar and kitchen staff ensured that both drinks and meals were served in a timely manner and of  utmost quality.,1
Its always a great experience at the Brooklyn Hilton,1
Hotel is magnificent in a great location. However the only problem is the price for parking.,1
Nice hotel at reasonable rates. Good option if you want to escape crowds of manhattan with plenty of shopping and dining options nearby,1
Hotel staff was very friendly hotel very clean bar on first floor excellent location i will def stay again,1
This hotel is excellent from the minute you walk in until checkout. The rooms are well maintained| very comfortable and clean.Location is right by several metro stations so its easy to get around. Will absolutely stay there again when in Brooklyn.,1
Staff were very accommodating. Unfortunately| there is no parking onsite.,1
The room was very large| everything was clean| and the staff was friendly.,1
Wonderful location with comfortable rooms and friendly staff,1
Great stay. Breakfast was the only weak spot. There was a shortage of staff workin so getting anything not on the messy buffet was very difficult.,1
Very nice hotel. Room heating system very wierd- difficult to heat room,1
I was so disappointed by our stay. Had reserved a room with king sized bed. And had called the hotel to tell them we'd be late. When we checked they said there were no more rooms with king sized beds. Our TV didnt work so someone had to come up several times to fix it. Sheets were dirty. I was so disappointed and it was a birthday weekend getaway.,0
"Great location| good morning breakfast. Poor ""complementary wifi - very slooooow.",1
great spot| lots to do nearby| and steps from subway,1
Wonderful service. Called for breakfast few minutes after 11 and they still took our order and room service. Overall a super place to stay. Loved the cleanliness.,1
The hotel was really nice. Convenient location and nicely appointed. My only real issue was that my TV could not be turned on without having to mess around with the plug for every time.,1
Overall I had a pleasant stay at this hotel| it doesn't offer the warm cookie on check in though!!! The room was spacious & housekeeping was excellent. It's approx 5-7 mins walk to the nearest subway station| Dominoes pizza| bakery & Baskin Robbins etc... Generally| the reception staff were nice| quite formal which is okay| but lacked the personable touch. However| one exception in the shape of Masood who was attending at breakfast was a really nice guy| he was very helpful & explained the use of the lounge. The girl who checked me in failed to mention the complimentary drinks & snacks in the lounge or drinks from the reception area. Also| despite there being 4 guests in my room| housekeeping kept leaving 2 towels!!! Front desk were happy to bring extra up. No shuttle bus service available| no bathrobes| misplaced towel rail in bathroom| no long closet to hang dresses| overall though this is a clean| conveniently situated hotel.,1
Great comfortable bed| good TV| only 3 minutes walk to 4 subway lines| nice and clean.,1
Excellent customer service and clean and convenient walking distance to most places..,1
Staff was very helpful and friendly. Room was clean.,1
A very comfortable and clean hotel. The are super welcoming and rooms are very spacious.,1
Stayed for three nights| hotel seemed| clean| simple and stuff was friendly.The only thing i missed to have drinks and snacks in my room. However| there were drinks| coffee satiation and infused water in the lobby at all times.,1
"We had a wonderful stay at the Hilton Brooklyn NY. The service was great| the check-in was easy and we were close to many 'touristy"" things in our plan. We loved the spacious room and the very cozy beds. We will definitely stay here again!",1
Great experience great location..will definitely come back,1
It was a very nice hotel actually booked another Hilton for my next visit in October| only will ask that the place in the room complimentary bottle water and not have to call for them,1
Excellent hotel. Clean| spacious for NYC| and excellent breakfast. Location only a short walk to Brooklyn heights shopping and restaurants. I would stay there again.,1
perfect place to stay....close to the subway station.  Incredibly clean| comfortable and plenty of room for all.  Don't hesitate to book this hotel!,1
comfortable stay,1
Very quiet despite being in downtown Brooklyn. Lots of great neighborhood restaurants in the vicinity.  Staff was lovely and helpful. Would stay here again without hesitation. Valet parking is $55| the only negative.,1
The room alarm clock was set to 1.5hrs ahead. The AC was very good... a bit too good| I needed to use the additional blanket from the closet. But overall I had lovely stay.,1
The nicest place we've been at in Brooklyn-- clean| new and good service. Only negative thing was that the wifi was a bit spotty at times.,1
Hotel location is great coming in or leaving Brooklyn. Comfortable and clean rooms| friendly staff.  I will highly recommend it,1
The only thing was that it was difficult to get a cab as they were not hanging around like they do in other hotels.  We ended up taking an Uber| which was fast and efficient.,1
Not far from the subway. Felt like a pretty safe place in day and early evening. We weren't out late.  I would stay there again if in the area.,1
Easy access very big room especially for nyc. Only minutes from manahatten,1
Its always a pleasure to stay here. The pillows are the most comfortable pillows i ever laid my head upon. Like sleeping on clouds.,1
We absolutely loved this hotel. The location was great and the room was nice big and airy. The staff was very accommodating and the downstairs bar and restaurant were great for happy hour and food. We would definitely stay here again!,1
Staff was very friendly. I am visually impaired and the guy at the desk walked me to my room.,1
Wonderful stay. Hotel is luxury in every way.,1
Only stay one night but it don't take that long to fix a gas/hit water problem.  That was something hotel could've of metion before checking in. NOT VERY HAPPY WILL NEVER BOOK THIS HOTEL AGAIN,0
one of the best places in brooklyn.  enjoyed the proximity to bars| restaurants| and subway stations.  will recommend definitely.,1
The king suite had exceptionally generous space and was perfect for a family with the separate bedroom. Only complaint is that. considering this is a brand new Hilton| the quality of the lighting in the room was poor and the walls were surprisingly bare. Overall would come back primarily for the space and comfortable bedroom. Staff were very helpful.,1
Apparently| the hotel deal involved assigning what some might view as less desirable rooms| in this case a handicapped access room.  After we adjusted to the idiosyncrasies| we decided it was worth it to have the extra space.  Staff were great and the location was perfect.  Would stay in Downtown Brooklyn again and be happy to return to the Hilton.  Just  wish Hotels.com made it clear that we would have a handicapped access room.,1
Everything about the stay was great.  Wound up staying a second night (flight cancelled) and the second room smelled a bit of whatever cleaning agent but not a terribly big deal.,1
This Hilton goes above and beyond to make sure you are taken care of while in NYC. Wonderful staff| clean rooms| comfortable beds and good food. Couldn't ask for anything more!,1
For the price I paid the parking should have been free . I paid an extra 200.00 dollars for parking my car...Wow next time I will for a Hilton in S.I. at least yhe parking is free.,1
Fabulous!!!!  Will stay there again!!!,1
This hotel is very nice and clean also comfortable i was surprised the room was so big bcuz i know hotels in newyork are very small but it was good hotel for the price will be back for sure.,1
The place was clean| newly designed and furnitured| only complaint I have that the TV had no connection to net and wasn't Netflix available ...otherwise satisfied.. :),1
This hotel is beautiful| we were treated so nicely by everyone who worked there. Love the Peter Thomas Roth toiletries too! We booked this hotel because we had tickets to see the Nets play at Barclays Stadium which was a 20 min walk. We were also able to walk to all the bars and restaurants on Smith Street which is right around the corner from the hotel| perfect! They even have valet parking so we never had to deal with our car until we checked out and then they had it waiting out front for us! Definitely highly recommend this Hilton!,1
Good hotel clean nice staff | the food for room service was poor and expensive,1
We checked in late was told that our booking has been canceled| which was fully paid - without any communication. We were accommodateed but with the a different room we paid for| and also my card is charged twice the amount| i was told that i'll get the amount back to my card which I hope so. Overall not a great experience.,0
Very pleased with the room| clean| comfortable.  Hotel near main attractions.,1
We will definitely be back!,1
Gorgeous| spotless| and very helpful polite staff. I've visit Brooklyn regularly| this is my new go-to hotel.,1
The Hilton Brooklyn is a great hotel.  It is a little further from the main sites than some other hotels but only by 5 minutes walk.  Have stayed here a couple of times and service is good as you would expect and rooms are of a high standard.,1
Clean and great location! Staff are friendly and professional| made my stay very pleasant. Would book again.,1
Very good location for getting to Manhattan and other tourist attractions without having to live stay in Manhattan.,1
Perfect location for exploring Cobble Hill and downtown Brooklyn. Close to subways but very quiet and comfortable. Right next to Macy's.,1
My best friend and I attended the Brooklyn Tabernacle Music Conference this past weekend and stayed at the Hilton Brooklyn. We could not have asked for a better location and accommodations. The Hilton Brooklyn is one block from BTab. The hotel is new| rooms are very spacious| and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Cleanliness of rooms and facility was top-notch! Highly recommend.,1
I give my experience 4 stars overall.  Room service messed up on my food and they replaced it and gave me 50% discount.  Food is nice and the staff is wonderful. I look forward in going back but would choose a different type of room,1
We missed our flight out and stayed here it was fantastic.  It was like a last minute getaway lol.,1
The hotel has an excellent location| staffs are competent and helpful| the room is spacious| clean and very comfortable.,1
Great place to stay,1
We were attending the Jazz Age Lawn Party and the hotel was perfect for the ferry to Governor's Island| Restaurants| Shops and my daughter's apartment in Carrol Gardens.,1
Great Brooklynn location with easy access to Lower Manhattan!  Hotel was very clean and staff were incredibly helpful and accommodating!,1
I had a wonderful stay at the Hilton in Brooklyn. The room was clean and spacious and everyone was super friendly and helpful. It is close to the subway and the Brooklyn Heights Promenade and the surrounding area. I would highly recommend.,1
I have a great experience and highly recommend this hotel,1
We stayed at The Hilton Brooklyn with my son for my friend's wedding. Our room was clean and had great views with three large windows. Although the website said that it had a microwave and chair/sofa by the window| which it did not. It only had a desk chair. My friend had a suite that was less great. The TV would not connect to the WiFi| it did not have a long mirror (only the one in the bathroom over the sink)| and we had to call multiple times to get extra chairs in the room. The executive lounge and breakfast was great! However|the restaurant and room service is lacking when it comes to food for children. Its menu is geared more toward adults.,1
Nice hotel close to three different subway stations.,1
It was amazing and service top notch !,1
Staff were courteous and professional| location of the hotel was centralized and close to a lot of restaurants and  tourist sites,1
we really enjoyed,1
Hilton Brooklyn was a lovely hotel right in the heart of Brooklyn.  We had a great stay there.,1
Totally enjoyable trip. Hotel was excellent. Service was outstanding.   All the hotel employees were knowledgeable |friendly |and very helpful.  The bellboy and valet person were excellent also.  The room itself was spotless.  Beds were very comfortable. Bathroom  was extremely clean and the shower  was hot. Will look to stay there  again when I return.,1
Very convenient and great value for money for NYC for Hilton.  Wish brkfst was included.,1
Within walking distance of family so very convenient,1
This hotel was amazing.  It's in my favorite Brooklyn neighborhood| great rooms| and amazingly friendly service. Next time I'm in Brooklyn| I'll definitely be staying here!,1
Very nice hotel. Beautiful room. Staff was very friendly and welcoming.,1
The hotel is excellent. Great room| clean and spacious. However we ordered a grilled cheese for our kid and we were charged $35. No joke| and it wasn't even good| he wouldn't eat it. So I recommend the hotel but not the food.,1
Excelent ubication| services| confort,1
Hotel d√©cor was good| staff friendly and location superb| but not many facilities such a gym| or we didn't know about it,1
It's only been open 3-4 months. Sasha (I forget the names of the other front desk staff) were phenomenal. Felix| engineering and all around fix it guy| also excellent| friendly| great attitude| made us feel like royalty. The room/bathroom size was adequate but the bed| a bit on the firm side for me| the pillows| way too soft| housekeeping did an amazing job to keep it super clean and stocked with towels and toiletries. We traveled to NY to unfortunately bury my mother and put up her headstone etc. and the evening before checkout I asked a gentleman at the front desk for a late checkout on a Monday and he had authority to extend from 12:00 to 1:00 and added that we'd need to discuss with the on duty manager who gets in at 9:00am. When I asked what it might cost to extend it from 1:00 to around 6:00 (our flight home wasn't leaving till after 10:00pm and we were exhausted from the many trials and tribulations it took for the funeral etc| to which he expressed his condolences and said he wasn't sure but perhaps $75.00 to maybe half day room rate). We called the next morning and the manager was not only not compassionate to our plight but very straight forward and said to extend the 4 hours would be a full days rate| didn't express anything for my loss and my wife explained what front desk told us the night before| he didn't care and said that info was wrong and that housekeeping leaves at 4:00pm. Heartless in my opinion|could be cleaned Monday. We won't be using Hilton again.,1
Was good except the dining room does not serve any food after 9:30 am for breakfast during the week.  We had to go elsewhere.  The front desk does not provide cash.  In an unfamiliar place this is very uncomfortable for elderly women.  We were pointed out to nearest ATM.,1
2nd Stay at this hotel.  1st was perfect.  2nd time there was a problem with the fridge.  It had not been cleaned and the previous guest's food remained.  Told the front desk.  Left the room.  When I returned| the fridge had still not been cleaned.  Staff cleaned on second request.  Otherwise everything was good.  Would have appreciated being comped something| but the hotel didn't offer anything.,1
Overall my stay was great the only thing is when my husband and I ordered room service the food was cold.,1
The area is developing so you have several of the high street shops. Very close to Brooklyn Tabernacle church| Barclays Centre and trains. One great aspect is hotel provides Netflix!,1
Stay was great great location parking was shaky,1
Great stay| great location,1
Good| clean hotel| staff were friendly but not always observant to the little touches| especially in replenishing of housekeeping items. Otherwise good stay in this hotel. Breakfast was expensive.,1
Everything was very clean. The place looks brand new and is beautiful. The staff was very friendly and even suggested near by places to go. I would highly recommend a stay here for anyone visiting Brooklyn or going to an event at the Barclay's Center,1
Much cleaner then I expected| the staff was friendly and made my experience one I will never forget.  Ill be back !,1
I Really Enjoyed My Stay At The Hiltons.,1
First they mixed up my room ! Then it was a mouse in my room. I called manager and they offered to move me but I left the hotel then they gave me the run around about getting my money back still haven't got it back yet ! I stayed in room 328,0
I was staying in Brooklyn to be close to a job. The other hotels were booked and Hilton had a great rate for the two nights. Very comfy bed!,1
The room did not have a bathtub. I thought it advertised one.,1
It was perfect :-),1
The hotel is very well located| in a walking distance to the Brooklyn Bridge. The hotel is pretty new and the rooms are spacious. Great that the room has a big TV where you can watch Youtube videos.,1
Super close to the metro stop and Shake Shack :) The front desk people were delightful. The bed was soooo warm and cozy| and  the towels were so plush.,1
Brand new facility - just opened this week.  Everything is clean| new| and comfortable.  Area is undergoing redevelopment with nearby shopping| diner| subway and bus transportation.,1
Doubletree bumped us to Hotel Central New York South and it was the worst experience ever| no house keeping| I had to call the lobby and ask to have someone come get the trash and I had to call to ask for toilet paper and fresh towels. The shower door didn't close correctly the sink faucet spritzed everywhere| there was no complimentary bottle water the ice machine didn't work| and the area was not very nice at all| I would not recommend this place even to my worse enemy,0
I really enjoyed my stay. Will recommend to others. Customer service very friendly.,1
Could not use our reservation due COVID and could not cancel AND lost our Reward Night. Very disappointing.,0
I made a reservation at the Double Tree. When I showed up| I was informed that it was turned into a shelter due to covid.  No one informed me of this in advance. My reservation was moved to another hotel with no heads up at all.,0
Clean property| needs snack vending machines and food service,1
Good hotel overall. Service staff were super helpful and polite. Linens were clean. The only issue I had with the room was the bad mildewy or moldy smell from heating/cooling unit whenever the fan was on| and the strong mold smell in bathroom so I left the fan on all day. Down pillows also had strong smell. Not for the allergic.,1
Wonderful stay. Breakfast is okay but all stead were nice.,1
Terrible smoke smell. No shampoo or soap. No toilet power holder. Had 2 rooms and both had extremely inconsistent maid service. Not up to Hilton standards really disappointed.,0
The bathroom pipes were clogged all the time! It was uncomfortable when it comes to share your stay with some friends.,1
Staff and service goes above and beyond. Would recommend this hotel.,1
Great experience|  will travel here again,1
Easy check in| check out.  Friendly| helpful staff. Room on the small side for a 6 night break. No room for suitcases. Good area with easy transport links to enjoy Manhattan.,1
Elevetor doors are v noise upon opening and closing,1
The hotel is run down and the elevators break down.  Although the staff was nice| not very knowledgeable.  I needed a safety pin and asked for a sewing kit.  The staff advised it did not come with one and I should go to Duane Reade.  I asked for one anyway and found one in the sewing kit.,0
Clean and comfy and a great rate. We have been coming for decades. Seems as they are cutting corners little by little| our room was looking slightly ragged.,1
Great location.  For New York| very reasonably priced.,1
Very nice. Room on the small side but had everything new needed,1
Very nice place and staff. Bar tender was amazing she talked with us and was very sweet and good at her job,1
Good location| close to Maison Kayser| Ess-a- bagel| subway station!,1
Had made reseveration thru Hotels.comType of room was not available. Had been put in a double bed room for 4 nights. Spent over 2 hours on the phone with hotels.com just got so frustrated. So much for sliver service from Hotels.com. It was a joke...,0
Very nice hotel. Clean| good sized room! (especially for a hotel in Manhattan!) When I was checking in| the front desk person was very nice and helpful. They also offered late checkout. The breakfast was delicious. I didn't realize the breakfast buffet closed at 10am| I got there at like 10:45. I was kind of disappointed by that| but the food you could order on the menu was great. Also the cookies they give you at the front desk is very good. Only thing that bothered me is during the night the hallway smelled like a strong smell of cigarette smoke. But I think that was another guest smoking. The hotel has signs in the rooms that say smoking is not allowed. It's in a great location. Right near Herald Square Macy's and all the subways/PATH trains. Very short walk to Times Square and all the main attractions. Also Chelsea is a very nice neighborhood in general| so the hotel is along a nice street. I will definitely be staying here again next time I need a hotel in NYC!,1
Tiny rooms| kind of run down hotel| but clean and good service. The breakfast is not worth the price| it would be expensive at half the price,1
Great location staying at this hotel| close to the subway and easy to get an Uber/taxi. Approx 15 minute walk from empire state building and only 10 minutes from madison square garden. Great restaurants located nearby and very convenient location. Staff are excellent and helpful! You can request mineral water for free at the check in desk each day. The rooms are ok| very outdated and the cleanliness was ok - found dust around the room on our first day when we checked in. The lifts are appalling| there are about 27 floors in this hotel and only 2 lifts that skip the bottom floors. We were on the 4th floor and just took the stairs down each time as we gave up waiting for the lift. Apart from that| all was ok! Decent for the price paid and location.,1
Conveniently located to Penn Station| Madison Square Garden| Macy's and not far from Times Square..,1
Good location and value. Rooms were small for 4 people. Service was great. 2 elevators were not enough for all the guests.,1
Great location and the staff we interacted with were extremely helpful and friendly. Overall a fairly nice place| however the carpet in the common hallway on our floor (5th) was filthy. Looked like it hadn't been vacuumed or cleaned in some time. Our room's carpet was fine| albeit a little dated. So overall not that big of a deal| but it was hard not to notice as it's the first thing you see when you step off the elevator.,1
1. Great location 2. Unfriendly and not helpful staff3. Very long waiting time for an elevator 4. Small lobby (huge traffic area in a very limited space)5. Very tiny rooms| no space for suitcases| no place to sit down)6. Room service is not regular (no cleaning at times)7. The cleaning is partial (garbage is not removed| bedding is ok)8. Tv üì∫ is not working9. No coffee machine| no cups,0
The room was terrible handles on closet were broken bathroom door was difficult to open. The bathroom shower was it seems made for handicap and water would end up all over bathroom floor| shower head was difficult to adjust. Mattress was extremely soft and we would sink to the center.,0
The hotel is older| but clean  and the beds were really nice. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The only negative was the lobby. It is quite small with very little seating. Overall I definitely would stay here again.,1
The location is good. Easy to get to Time Square| and other parts of Manhattan .The beds were excellent| and the room very clean.,1
I felt that the rooms need to be updated. The carpet was stained and the chair needed to replaced.,1
The staff was so lovely... very friendly and helpful... room service which is sometimes delivered as an afterthought... was excellent!Thank you.  I would recommend this hotel... Chelsea| close to Union Square| Times Square and a walk to Penn Station!!,1
"Security knocking on my door in the middle of the night to perform a ""Room Audit ""?",1
We had a quick trip in and out and didn't even venture into the restaurant. But| the staff was super kind and accommodating.,1
Location is great.   5 minutes walk from Penn Station.   The hotel is very small and old but the room and amenities were very nice.  Great shower|The best thing was the price!!!!    I can give up fancy lobby and oversized rooms to save substantial amount of money,1
Very good will be back,1
Good location. Friendly staff. Would have been nice to have a more relaxed bar area.,1
The hotel is 3 blocks from Penn Station and around the corner from a subway stop.  The view of the Empire State Building from the window was great.  The 2 bed room was small but good for a weekend.,1
The staff was very courteous and friendly.  Upon arrival| was greeted with warm chocolate peanut butter cookies.  Very small room and cozy bed.  The carpet is very dated but overall| I enjoyed my stay.  The upper floor rooms is were the view of the Empire State Building.  The location was great.  The hotel is close to the police dept| Metro train| Empire State Buliding| Madison Square Garden| The Wendy Williams and Rachel Ray Show.  Plenty of restaurants and galleries.  Only problem was self parking| which is on the other side of the hotel.  Two night stay... Arrived late| around 8 pm.  Parking was discounted at $33 per 24 hrs stay.   I was charged full price on the last day| after leaving early.  Plus if you leave out of the parking garage| the Parking garage will recharge you an additional $33 to park.    Other than that| I will stay at this hotel agsin.,1
Every single staff member we interacted with was friendly and super helpful! The room was clean| neat and modern and the drawer of warm cookies is to die for!!!!,1
Overall| the hotel didn't seem to reflect the quality that I've experienced in the past with Doubletree.  With the Doubletree brand| I expect higher quality versus other hotels.  At this location| the service was strong and professional.  The lobby was very dated and small| with no real sense of presence.  The rooms (including bathrooms) were small for a Doubletree even in NYC.,0
Service was terrible.  Upon arrival the front desk clerk did paperwork and ignored me for at least 10 minutes before checking me in.  Coffee in the morning is complimentary and when leaving the front desk charged me extra for coffee.  Don't mind paying for coffee but not when it's supposed to be complimentary.  The front desk and manager argued with me when I brought it to their attention and actually accused me of eating breakfast there| which never happened. Will never go there again!,0
Easy to get in and out. Excelent| responsive and friendly staff.,1
Great say enjoyed the hotel significantly,1
Location! That was the main reason.The welcoming cookies are a nice touch.I didn't like the price| but everything in or around midtown was expensive when I picked this one.Carpets are old| but not the end of the world,1
weekend visit| htel close t Penn. Station which is excellent. Hotel staff excellent they were all Very nice and helpful . There was free coffee in the morning but breakfast buffet was $22.95||||a bit pricey - I just want something to have with my coffee like a muffin.,1
Very convenient midtown location. Room size was good| king bed| decent sized bathroom. Love the warm cookies & free bottled water available at the front desk! Only 2 elevators so sometimes you have to wait| but we were on the third floor so could take the stairs in a pinch. There were a few minor condition issues| like the bathroom sink was not flush with the marble counter cutout| but overall it was clean and comfortable.,1
I didn't like how I booked a room that was stated view of the Empire State Building I did not have that and I am not sure if the hotel even had the view of it But I def don't want to pay more and then not get the room u pay for,1
The room was tiny| even by New York standards.  The hallways were narrow. The neighborhood is dirty and smelly.,0
This happens to be one of my favorite Hotels. I love the rooms| bed| locations and the Main Attraction of All Their Delicious Cookies üç™...,1
The location is really good. Check in was friendly and efficient - the welcome cookie may have swayed my judgement on this. Room was fine. Comfy bed and reasonable shower. One of the reasons we booked was no add ons for internet or ‚Äúresort fees‚Äù.,1
Good location and comfortable. Staff helpful & good cookies!,1
Pretty nice| good price| helpful staff and| specially| localization!,1
People was nice and the breakfast was really good.,1
Location and price. Cleaning came too early in the morning. No hooks to hang towels.,1
I want a refund.  The hotel cancelled the reservation and fully charged me.  We never even stsyed there.  Thet said we arrived too late and still fully charged the 2 days.  I had to pay for anither hotel.  Please refund,0
Great location! Very central to everything. Close to NJ transit station (3 min walk). Close to subway (28th). Walking distance to time square. Not to mention all the great place to eat and get a coffee. Whole foods is like 3 blocks away.,1
Great location. Wonderful staff. We arrived several hours early during the heat wave. After a short wait in the air conditioned lobby with ice water| they checked us in early. The a/c was on in our room when we got there. Heaven! Very comfortable beds.,1
This was a nice hotel in a good location. Very comfortable bed and room was nice| cool| and clean.,1
Fantastic location for New York. Service from the staff was excellent. Quite a nice hotel.,1
Brilliant location| although not the most beatiful streets around the hotel. Nice bedroom with AC| fridge and TV. WiFi was OK. THe breakfast was a bit boring but it was absolutely worth the money.,1
Good air conditioning| helpful staff. Location okay.,1
The front desk clerks were awesome. They helped us with the WiFi and were always attentive. The cleaning staff were extremely friendly. Good location. Comfortable rooms and I loved the pillows and cookies!!,1
Great location and great staff.Room wasn't ready till 4 but that is when check in was... but they held our bags so we could go off and explore!,1
Excellent location! Very friendly staff! Super clean place!,1
the place was awful. it was very old| dirty. The room was old and carpet dirty. We did not feel comfortable at all. It is the first time I book on expedia and get a terrible hotel.,0
 It's a 7 min walk to a Nordstrom Rack and a 3-5 min walk to reasonably priced eateries & pizza parlors.,1
Breakfast staff was very friendly and refilled items that needed refilling,1
Terrible overated big elevator problem not safe  Inexperienced staff,0
We would have liked to have complimentary breakfast considering how much we paid for the room.,1
My reservation for a king with a top floor view was not available. I was put in a queen room on the 3rd floor next to the elevator.,0
The welcoming staffs were very polite and helpful. We were able to check in early which is a plus! Love the complimentary fruit infused water they have daily. My kids really enjoy that esp coming back from a day full of walking and NYC adventures. Our beds were comfy | rooms were small but that to be expected for NYC.  Location is great to all the landmarks we wanted to tour. Not crazy loud like Times Square. We will be back. Thank you!,1
The staff is warm and inviting. The hotel though luxurious and spacious feels cozy and comforting a nice shelter from the city outside,1
Great locale. Front desk person was awesome. Very comfortable bed quiet,1
Only issue with stay was 2 nights in a row we we're awoken by what sounded like trash trucks that were working for at least 2 hours right outside our room,1
I did not like everything at all I did not like everything at all I did not like everything at allI did not like everything at all,0
Great rooms for the price although they are tiny. Very clean. Bar/restaurant is small| we had to find somewhere to eat to fit our party of 7. Staff was excellent.,1
I attempted to cancel this reservation prior to staying but I was within the cancellation period.  I am truly disappointed at the conditions of this hotel.  The Hilton Chelsea did not meet its expectations.  The check in was good but the rooms are old| smell| and small.  Our first room had dirty linens and smelled so they switched our room... The second room wasn't as big| but was cleaner.  I will never stay at this property again nor recommend it!,0
I ENJOYED IT AND THE STAFF WAS VERY PROFESSIONAL,1
This property is very old. The room condition was quite poorly maintained. Ripped wall paper| stained carpets| the hallways are really worn and dirty| the public bathrooms are disgusting and the smell is horrible| there are only two elevators and you may have to wait 15 minutes for an elevator| the rooms are so tiny you have no where to open luggage (they are all the same as we asked to upgrade and there are only a few studios)| the condition of the ac/heating unit is awful (broken units)| the iron was so damaged that it destroyed my shirt and the bathrooms are so tiny and the door takes up so much space (why isn't there a sliding door?). Overall there's not much to like. This hotel needs a major overhaul. Even the lobby is unkept| unwelcoming| and unsightly. For a Hilton property this was really poorly maintained.,0
Everyone and everything was great! Location to all the attractions was awesome,1
Fabulous! The only thing annoying was the elevators| which tended to be consistently overloaded.,1
Close to penn station Customer service was great.  Rooms were clean,1
Clean building and friendly staff. Would stay here again.,1
Great location| near subway and easily walk to many great spots,1
Perfect location very close to principal streets| quiet and lovely staff,1
Fantastic location| friendly staff. Would definitely start here again in the future.,1
Great location. Easy check in. Comfortable beds. The staff was very friendly. The rooms were very quiet. The tv was big,1
Great staff - great location! Close to Penn Station.,1
The front desk staff were very nice and accommodated our late check out,1
It was close to Madison Square Garden. It is an older hotel| but it was clean and the staff was friendly. It had a nice New York feel to it.,1
Hotel itself is excellent. Area it is in kit so excellent,1
Everything was great from booking| checking in| and even checking out. Was a great experience,1
Only note: Standard rooms are simple and small! Just a bedroom and small bathroom. Perfect for me and my needs but i would not attempt to fit more that 3-4 people in there| and wouldnt sleep more than 2-3 in same bed.,1
The hotel. The views are amazing.,1
Very good work | enjoyed the  stay and will chose again,1
Every single member of the staff was an absolute joy! So helpful and nice. Perfect hotel for a weekend trip to the city!,1
Great location - could walk everywhere!  Close to coffee shops| restaurants| museums and Broadway.,1
The location is ideal.  The street is quiet| and it is close to Seventh Avenue and Madison Square Garden.  The lobby is compact.  The staff prompt and friendly.,1
Great location. Staff very friendly and helpful.   Rooms small but clean. Parking across street reasonable with hotel discount.,1
Location is great! Always check this hotel when visiting nyc. Staff are super friendly and helpful.,1
Worn out - really old inside - no front desk to speak of. Not worthy of the Hilton name and certainly no 4 star! Very disaapointing.,0
Excellent no complaints at all . Child unfortunately was sick on carpet and reported it the receptionist was lovely and more concerned with the child's health offered medical card | no worries all got sorted . Staff were very nice and cookie was lovely on arrival . Beds are so comfortable. Quiet location but only 5 to 10 min dander yo time square. Central location,1
The room was wonderful. But I feel like they need to have more elevators for a hotel of his size: the lobby is always filled with a crowd waiting for the elevator.,1
Convenient. Friendly staff. But very small room. However| I understand why.,1
Good location but the room was very noisy and the heating controls were very temperamental.,1
I like the location| as well as the friendly staff.,1
Staff was very friendly and even took care of our bags after check out since we had a late night flight.,1
comfy beds| loved the chocolate chip cookie they give at check-in. very courteous staff.,1
Good location and very nice staff. Enjoyed staying!,1
Hotel was far from the pics but it is all good. Contstruction were ongoing. We were ‚Äúdouble check-in‚Äù| meaning given a room that was already occupied since when we entered| I noticed the luggage from the guest before me in line. Usually| I would see a worry or concern but the agent didn't seem apologetic but she did fix it right away. The elevators will take you forever to go up your floors especially during the holidays since I'm assuming it was a packed season.,1
Good property in the middle of NYC. Parking spot they work with didn't give us the discounted price though.,1
Very convenient location.  Easy check in. Room was comfortable.,1
Great location| Good price. Adequate room size and amenities. Extremely fast free wi-fi.,1
The location was very convenient. Could get to everything in NYC easily.The room was very clean BUT VERY SMALL FOR TWO PEOPLE.,1
It was fine... they are doing a bit of construction.  Wasn't crazy about the location (personal preference).  Service was great... all the staff are very friendly and helpful.  Bar area is nice.,1
Friendly staff and good location|pretty basic but very clean and as only spent minimal time in room not a problem.,1
Extremely friendly staff and very helpful.  The great cookies are a plus also.  Location is good for walking to sites or catching subway.,1
I have stayed at doubletree hotels for years across the country (I travel for work.) and I can say with certainty that this is bar none the most outdated and scary movie worthy. Pay extra somewhere else. It will be worth it.,0
Hotel is a little old/dated. Bit stuffy. Hotel bar/rest is not flash. Bed was very comfortable and large for a New York hotel room. Lots of draws and storage for cases and clothes which really helps. Higher floors are better for use of lifts as in the morning theres never room for lower floor guests to get in. First world issues....location is ok but in a bit of a tired/funny spot not really in Chelsea. Street is not appealing. For the price we've had better before.,1
Clean hotel with bare essentials,1
We had quite a lot of space with a suite - separate sitting area and two TVs. Tea/ coffee making facility Andy the heating systems were a bit awkward to use,1
Fab location really enjoyed our stay. Close to good cheap eats Maddison Square and Times Square and 5th Ave shops. What more could you need.,1
This is one of the most unfortunate stays I've had in a hotel in recent years. There are full and smelly trash bags everywhere| the halls| the stairwell| the walk up to the hotel. There was a sticky spot on my carpet and black mold in the shower. I've been in town for work| working long hours| and put the do not disturb sign on the door so I could sleep in on Saturday and Sunday and both days house keeping knocked and woke me up anyway. Behind the desk is paperwork and clutter.,0
The location was extremely convenient.The room was clean| staff was willing to help most of the time.But it's important to know that late check out fee is half the day's rate to extend 2 hours and full day's rate to extend 4 hours.Otherwise| everything else was great.,1
Check in service was excellent!  Fast. Nice. Professional.,1
Horrible. Looks nothing like the photos. Would never stay there again.,0
Hotel was in midst of refurbishment but staff were friendly and acted promptly to any request or issues.,1
On a positive note if there is one| the hotel was centrally located for the purpose of our visit.,0
The room service maid threw my toothbrush and toothpaste out of the room. Otherwise everything is fine.,1
The furnishings are old| carpet are dirty| the bed sheet has a blood stain| the service is bad from the front desk,0
I moved to this hotel after the horrible experience that's the Pennsylvania.I'm so happy to have moved to the DT| it has a great location| attentive staff and it's very clean and bright.On the negative: The hotel is small| the halls can feel a bit claustrophobic and if you have loud neighbors it will disturb your sleep.,1
The check-in process was easy and painless| and the front desk staff was so helpful! They printed some tickets for us that we forgot to do before we left and were so friendly. I recommend this hotel - located in a cute little neighborhood with so much to do and easy to get around. Plus| the bed was SO comfortable| we didn't want to get up!,1
Great location| walking distance from so many things!,1
Great experience. Staff friendly| helpful and wonderful.  Would return to the hotel again.,1
The room that I booked was not ready so they decided to upgrade us to a suite for the night. The suite was only prepared for 2 people when there was four of us and the bed sheets were urine stained and no cover on the duvet. On the second day| we were asked to change rooms again but again they had no room ready for us and we were asked to leave everything in our room with our valuables out of the safe for the hotel staff to move. I explained that we had valuables and passports that needed to stay in the safe and that I will not leave them unattended; they said that we can leave them or come back at 12 when there is a room available and if I didn't do either of the 2 choices I would be escorted from the premises. The manager on duty had a discusting attitude and did not want to help us one bit| even though it was the hotels fault that we had to move rooms,0
Hotel is under construction.  Great location! No issues with my stay. No microwave access for guest.,1
I like that it's within walking distance to New York areas like Times Square.  I also like that it's cleanly.,1
Great staff.  Helpful amidst the lobby construction.,1
For an advertised 4 star hotel- it is appalling- not even up to a 2 star!,0
Renovations in the lobby made it messy and very close quarters as most of the lobby was cordoned off to guests,1
Our hotel room was tiny| dirty and had a terrible odour. The carpet in the rooms was dirty. It is under a huge renovation so the whole lobby is torn up. There were workmen everywhere. It was not good. The staff were very nice and doing their best under the circumstances. I felt like it was not good value for the money,0
As a Hilton Honor member| I stayed at Hilton all over the world and this one is the worse one I ever experienced.Unfriendly staff plus the inconvenience caused by ongoing renovation made our stay a terrible one.,0
sheets were never changed during our trip and had blood on them| a lot of construction was going on downstairs so you couldn't sit outside| and hotel staff don't give consistent answers to questions,0
I like that this property is within walking distance of Times Square.,1
I loved my stay at this hotel. The staff was accommodating and friendly. My room was extremely clean| and the bed was super comfortable. Considering that this hotel is currently under renovations| I think the staff (specifically Alex and Harrington) are doing a great job. I will definitely return.,1
The room was clean| but small. The hotel was being remodeled downstairs| but the staff were friendly and professional.,1
Hotel currently under renovation but room was clean| quiet and nice.,1
The hotel is currently undergoing renovations. I will definitely book again because of location and staff friendliness.  Can't wait to see the final results!,1
The location was perfect| the beds were comfortable. The hotel was under renovations during our stay.,1
Great.. Place was clean and comfy.,1
Staff was nice| but rooms were dated and uncomfortable. Way too overpriced,0
All very nice but there is constuction on hotel| but in general all good| very helpfull staff,1
The location was amazing. I wish I could say about the room conditions. It badly needs updating especially the bathroom. The shower curtain needs to be washed or changed because the smell was horrible. It has a musty or dampy smell to it| kinda like when it wasn't dried properly. I thought it was just our bathroom| but I also checked my parents room and they also have the musty/damp smell in their shower curtain as well. The bathroom towel holder came loose during our stay. I think they are doing construction in the hotel and I really hope they would update the rooms too.,1
i wish i knew ahead of time about there renovation| they had two elevators which included the work men. no lobby and no out side area which was in was in a picture which helped to decide to stay there.,0
Overall good experience! Yeah. Just filling in additional words as I ‚Äòm unable to move forward unless I put in more characters.,1
The rooms are a bit small| but to be expected. The beds are comfy and everything is very well laid out. The rooms are very clean and comfy!,1
Great front desk service. Wonderful room. Only reason for 4star was that it was under renovation. Can't wait to come back when it's complete.,1
Very nice stay. Very comfortable bed and pillows. Convenient location. Very pleasant and supportive staff. Great value.,1
It was in a good location. Walking distance to Madison square garden and subway stations. The hotel is in the process of contruction so that would be a con but not much of an inconvenience. The restaurant bar is small and enclosed. Maybe add more lighting to it to make it more open. The room with view to the Empire state was not great. My expectation was maybe a full on view of it but it was not. But overall it was a good stay.,1
Great location.  Comfortable beds.  Room and bathroom were small but probably typical for New York.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.,1
hotel location is great. But room was awful| too small| bad odor in the room and beds| no success to change the room. Asked to have mini refrigerator without success as well.,0
Currently under construction so there are only 2 elevators which at one point there was a line just to go up. Lobby was cut in half so it got crowded and crammed. It was also occasionally loud due to the machinery being used. Smaller than I expected but it is NYC so it makes sense. Great location and access to subways and tourist areas. Staff was friendly and helpful. Room had everything we needed and was a nice stay. It wasn't anything fancy| but it wasn't bad. If you need a place to rest your head| get in a million showers (with that summer humidty!)| great A/C| nice location| then this place should do it!,1
Good location| friendly staff| and reasonable parking. Rooms need some updating.,1
Location is great!,1
Very nice & friendly atmosphere very clean room it was close to Madison sq.  garden  which made it nice,1
Other then that the hotel was good and location was good for the price,1
The hotel was average.  Construction in the entry felt less than inviting. The front desk and concierge were helpful and friendly.,1
great location central to everything and not in the crazy busy but walkable to all destinations. wifi supplied not always the best and kept dropping out.,1
Really disappointed in this Hilton property. I am a Hilton Honors member and the staff made multiple comments about booking‚Äù through a third party‚Äù. Rude front desk.   Dirty lobby. Bed good and housekeeping good. I stay in lots of hotels and very rarely leave poor reviews but I would never recommend. Too many other places in area that exceed.,0
Typical small room| but okay. We were on the second floor with a view of scaffolding over the front entrance. This is where quests smoked which seeped through the AC unit. Bathroom was tiny with little room for two people to place their toiletries.,1
Hotel was nice and the DoubleTree cookies were great. The exterior area was under construction (scaffolding) when we arrived| but I guess that's New York. The room was cozy (we had a King room). The hotel is within excellent walking distance of stores/restaurants. I would definitely stay there again because it was very affordable.,1
This is a 27 story hotel with two tiny elevators.  During our four day stay on the 25th floor| only one elevator worked so you we were waiting up to 20 minutes for the elevator.  Very disappointing.,0
We'll definitely go back again!,1
the rooms were old  and small.  the AC was noisy| I had to shut it down. One elevator was out of order.  It tooks 25 mns to go up or down| stopping at every floor.,0
Tucked away from Times Square this hotel gives you the best of both worlds. The room was small and I got two double beds instead of one and the view wasn't great. Actually felt like the room was dark because of the lack of sunlight. Anyways| would recommend for short stays.,1
The rooms was a bit small| however the hotel very clean and the customer service was awesome!!,1
I was surprised.  My only complaint about this property for the two days I stayed there was the carpet in the hallways.  It was old but with ice| salt and snow that happens. The staff was friendly.  The location to Macy's was great.  5 blocks and you're shopping and eating at K-Town.,1
Great location.,1
Good place to stay| local| clean and close to many NYC activities.,1
The hotel is off the beaten track tucked off the street on 29th. The room was small even by NYC standards| bathroom looked like it had not really been cleaned in number of stays| just a quick wipe. Shower was moldy| carpets needed work. Overall the condition of the room was poor. They definitely need to ramp up the inspection of the rooms. Also| someone needs to stay on top of the engineering department. Our room had a broken picture frame| a bathroom mirror that was delaminating| and some poorly repaired furniture.,0
One of the elevators was frequently out of service ( the majority of our four day stay)| leaving only one to transport guests in their 27 floor hotel. This was rather frustrating. Great views | great staff...,1
I would definately stay there again.,1
This is a great hotel with a TERRIBLE elevator situation.  Get a room on a lower floor and take the stairs.,1
Easy access to subway.  Very walkable neighborhood.  Close to sightseeing and shopping.  Room was comfortable bathroom small and ceilings with cracked plaster.  Enjoyed the view of the empire state building from our room.  Found nightly rates to be quite reasonable.,1
The receptionist were very friendly and nice. Great location| would recommend to others.,1
very comfortable and close to stores| theaters| restaurant an Penn Station.,1
arrived from niagara falls by train| walked about 10mins to reach the hotel.,1
rooms a little small| and elevators a little slow (and only 2 elevators for 20+ floors)| but room was very clean and comfortable.  Staff was helpful.,1
It was perfect for the price and the location. Could not ask for better.,1
I enjoyed being able to get a latte right across the street and the location.,1
Great price for an excellent location in the heart of Manhattan! My second stay here and I do not have any complaints. Would definitely recommend it!,1
Nice| convenient| clean. Helpful staff| easy check and check out. May go back again,1
The hotel is very comfortable and the location is very good to move around regardless of whether you choose to do that by feet or to take the subway (2 stations nearby). The staff is attentive and they store your luggage if you arrived earlier than expected. The room was super clean and cleaned again daily.,1
The hotel did not look like it did on the website. The room was small and looked like it had been a very long time since it was cleaned. The curtains were full of dust and we found a live roach in the drawer with the glasses and ice pitcher. The only thing positive that I can say is that the staff were all very friendly and apologetic.,0
Staff was very nice and friendly. Concierge was excellent. Room was ready well before checking time. Room was very clean and beds were comfortable. Bathroom could use a little updating. Hotel location was great.,1
I think the problems with this hotel all come from a lack of space.,0
Good stay; decent price for the accommodations provided . One of two elevators not working taking the stairs was not convenient. Location excellent. Room was small but clean- expected for a New York hotel in this price range.,1
attention needed to rooms - there was no do not disturb door sign; no back up roll of tp; minimal sugar for the one tea bag,1
This hotel is very central in Manhattan.. we love to walk| but had subways convenient to us if needed (Penn Station| 28th St) The rooms are ok in size for New York. Staff are friendly & helpful. The only negative is the lift| it needs an upgrade as was constantly breaking down. It wouldn't deter me from staying here again though.,1
Disappointed from start to finish. Rude at check-in| terrible mattresses| loud staff in the morning| 30 minutes elevator ride (not enough elevators period)| and no late checkout. The service and attitude was the worst part though| the other things could've been looked past.,0
The staff was very rude.,0
My daughter and I were looking for a reasonably priced Manhattan hotel room that was convenient and clean. This place fit the bill perfectly. The beds were super comfortable| the rooms were clean| and the cookies at check-in were awesome. I would definitely stay here again.,1
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel.,1
There were some sketchy characters near the hotel at night,1
We had a really nice stay at the hotel in February! Got a bit worried reading the reviews before arriving| but in general everyhting was really nice. One of the elevators broke twice during our 15 day-stay| but was repaired quickly. The location of the hotel is superb| near the center and walking distance to many points of interest. Heating and wifi worked. We were on the sixth floor| towards the inner yard and there was no noise. I would say the only minus was the duvet| which had no filling in it| but we did get an extra blanket when asking for it. The hotel is a bit worn out| but had good price-quality.,1
Great location| friendly staff and comfort room. Thanks!,1
Slightly annoying when one of two lifts breaks down.,1
Perfect hotel for a quick getaway to New York City. Great location and very good value for money. definitely recommend!,1
Walk distance to Pen Station| very ideal for overnight connecting flight via EWR airport. Other than that| the rest of hotel service is kinda normal. Facilities is a bit outdated and the elevator is a bit slow....,1
There is a bus stop and a subway station soon.Pennsylvania station is nearby| and access by Kennedy Airport and New Work Airport is also very good by train.,1
We loved our stay. Staff were very friendly and close to almost everything. Walking distance to everything you need to see. Clean and nice room| comfy bed. We ate at the restaurant also and the food were good!,1
The view was beautiful. Comfortable room !,1
The view was everything!!!,1
Liked the viewfrom our room| yet the windows obviously didn't get washed on the inside before we stayed.,0
Beautiful hotel| and the view was breathtaking from the 29th floor! However| I was really disappointed that there wasn't a microwave| and the refrigerator could only hold maybe 3-4 bottles of water!!! Didn't see an ice machine either!,1
Great hotel! Very clean| rooms are nice and comfortable. Right price for what you get.,1
Great location and very friendly staff. Amazing views. We woill stay there again.,1
I loved this property and will definitely stay there again! Every single staff was helpful and friendly! My view was immaculate and the size of the room fit my needs. Close to everything and easy access to taxis and Ubers. I do however| wish there was an over night kitchen or mini store for toiletries and snacks.  Even a microwave to reheat leftover meals or if I bring my children next time. Other than that I have no complaints and I recommend this hotel to everyone especially Californians who are used to spacious hotels.,1
Really  nice view,1
Everyone was so sweet and the room was huge with an amazing view! I would definitely stay there again. The receptionist was so nice she even gave us early check-in. Even the barista in the little shop was so sweet. I will definitely return!,1
Though the reservation was for a room with two double beds| the only room offered had a couple of twin beds!,0
This was my favorite hotel to stay in pre-Covid. Unfortunately now much has changed and not for the better. First| there is no hotel valet! As everyone knows around the hotel is UN parking and it is impossible to find find parking| so the lack of valet is a huge inconvenience. The clock/music player was outdated and not functioning well. When I called down to have it replaced I was brought an even older version. And finally I was told there were no functioning icemakers in the hotel| and if I wanted ice I had to go down to the ground level to the caf√© and purchase ice by the cup or the bag. I was literally charged five dollars for a tiny bag of ice that could fit in the palm of my hand. Was disappointing because this hotel is beautiful and I absolutely love the views so hoping that they consider changing these things in the future,0
The staff was incredibly helpful.  From the front desk to the bell hop| it was top notch.,1
Great stay very clean,1
This hotel| is in a great location| very accessible to little restaurants nearby. The room was spacious and the view was breathtaking. Honestly the view was worth everything.,1
Amazing quality of service ! Words cannot express how polite| helpful and friendly was everyone in the hotel specially  the front desk lady who helped us check in. The location is amazing!!! Walking distance to grand central| Bryant park and Times Square. And much more. Would definitely recommend to everyone I know and will use it in the future.,1
Hotel was quiet| and immaculate| as far as cleanliness.Highly recommend. Staff is courteous and attentive to all requests.,1
The view from the room and location was good. Lot of places nearby to eat out. The staff was generally nice (meets expectations). But it is an old hotel with hardly any space in the lobby. Lots of mirrors to hide the space problems (pictures on the site are deceptive). I could see ants crawling in the room| linens were oldish and bit soiled. Ratings on Expedia do not reflect reality. Maybe they invested to get the ratings improved artificially...Not sure. Would not recommend the price.,0
Nices view Great facilities,1
We visited the hotel during the pandemic hence most amenities were unavailable. However the staff was very friendly| helpful and professional.  I would love to come back there.,1
I like the fact that it is close to town and easily accessible.,1
Rooms were clean and updated. Coffee maker was dirty.  The view from both rooms was worth it for us| first time in NY.  The location and it's surroundings were peaceful and lots of stores for personal items and food within walking distance.  Service at the hotel was great and welcoming.,1
Everything,1
Such an amazing city view! Very nice room. We will be staying here again!,1
Since 9/11 the front desk personnel have s more military/police attitude. I understand the need for security except most hotels in NY manage to do it more subtly. Front desk should be staffed by people that make you feel welcome after a long trip. Also| restaurant was closed. No room service. No gym. Not even a bottle of water. Room and views were exceptional as always reminding me of why this used to be my favorite hotel in NY.,1
Staff was amazing!,1
The place is nice |i enjoyed my stay there but the staffs at the front desk could do better. I understand some people don't like their jobs| but at least act professional when a costumer is in front of you. You just can't be giving everyone an attitude at your work place| it doesn't make no sense. But overall the hotel is ok for it price,1
I've never seen a Hilton in such terrible shape...Room was not clean. Multiple stains on carpet| tears on carpet| stains on my comforter| trash under the bed and behind the curtains including a vape cartridge.  TV didn't work and I called and they said they'd send someone up| never did. On check out I told the woman about all of this and she said she'd talk to the manager and they would email me within the hour| never did.,0
room was way smaller than expected and overpriced,0
The front desk was not accommodating and very rude on arrival. I had a morning flight and wanted to leave my bags or do an early check in but they straight out refused my request. They had multiple people behind the desk but not one that can help with storing the luggage. They did not make the room upon request and stated that they are under staffed due to covid. The room was average| The only thing good was the view. I WOULD RECOMMEND staying somewhere else if you are planning on coming to NY.,0
Clean| comfortable rooms. Quiet and restful.,1
I like everything me and my husband has a great time,1
They need to update and clean. There was a large container of sex oil massage under our bed. Halls smelled like weed,0
The view was spectacular,1
Our stay at this hotel was very beautiful with the city view. The only complaints i have is the windows not being clean and due to our room being RIGHT next to the elevator| you could the elevator right through the walls. Even while being in the shower the wall shakes a little. Other than those two complaints the bed was very comfy and we enjoyed out stay.,1
Everything in my room except the was bad except the bed my refrigerator didn't work so the staff brought an extra fridge but it was a freezer & it frozed all my things & the extra 1 stayed & took so much space the heat wouldn't work the bath tub wouldn't stop running i have pictures & video & i paid so much for very low to no service,0
The view and the staff were amazing but the room could be cleaned better.,1
The room was decent and had a fabulous view. I was surprised by the fancy toilets they have. I would recommend,1
Great place to stay!,1
Horrible experience. Rude staff. Due to COVID| no room service. Compromise on standards| but no compromise on price. Quality comes at a price.  If you guys can't provide a good service hiding behind COVID| price has to be less too.  Staffs are really really rude,0
The view on the 40th floor was amazing and the room was perfect. The only dislike was the cleanliness... it could be much better,1
The room I had on the 34th floor was nice. The view was amazing and beds were comfy. Staff was very nice. Only thing that bothered me a bit was a weird smell in the hallways. The carpet outside the rooms could use a bit of a cleaning but other than that my room was perfect.,1
Mostly enjoyed the view| was close to airport| bed was very comfy...slept like a baby.,1
Too old and dirty nothing pleasant even the lobby on my floor too dark will never stay here again,0
I liked the location| size of the room| comfort of the bed and pillows| nice linens| view| helpful staff| room condition.The room air was stale when we first checked in but after 24 hours| the room had a better smell.  The hallway carpet looked pretty bad and I was surprised that a Hilton Hotel would not change that.,1
It was ok was an unexpected deposit n room wasn't clean,1
Good stay. Favorite hotel because of the views.,1
I stayed in this hotel 4 years ago. It was amazing. Now I will give it 0 stars if I get a chance.,0
The view from my room was beautiful| the room itself was not bad. The bathroom was also nice| shower very nice good pressure hot water. The issue I had was that housekeeping did not come once in the two nights that I was there. The sheets and pillowcase had a slight scent to it it| didn't appear dirty but it seems like it wasn't washed well enough. other than that the room was clean. And the other issue I did have was that the grill/restaurant that's in the hotel was closed and I was not made aware of that. I had waited till about nine to eat dinner thinking I was going to go downstairs and eat and then when I got down there there was a sign on the door that said it was closed temporarily for unknown reasons. The staff did not inform me that the restaurant was closed and I had anticipated going to eat dinner and have drinks there th.at evening but was disappointed when I got down there and the door was locked| before closing hours. Overall this day was decent.,1
the hotel is beautiful| the view from my room was amazing. The elevators seemed to be needing some work they are very loud and squeaky. The lobby and the rooms were supper clean and had lots of storage to put clothes and other items.,1
The room and view nice area lot to do around the hotel,1
This was a great clean hotel with an amazing view. I would definitely stay there again.,1
My flight was leaving late and the staff accommodated me with no issues. The rooms could be cleaned better and the sofa was stained. I enjoyed my stay.,1
Everything was great i had no complaints thank you for a wonderful stay,1
The weed smokers outside were not a pleasant sight to see. And what hotel doesn't have ice?,0
I loved the location but very dissappointes in the over fall staff and service. Staff wasRude| when I requested roomService I was told i need to give 24 hrs notice. I was unaware of such thing. I was given bedding to do the bed myself. No iron boards in room. Luggage rack was broken. Found items in room from previous stay. The whole hotel smelled of marijuana smoke! Staff at front counter was impolite and unfriendly. I totally regret the stay and disappointed that Hilton would allow this!,0
The room was nice with a nice view in the corner. What i was worry about was the room wasn't cleaned was dust by the coffee station|but the rest so far was good.,1
ve close r y frendly stufftion and cline posishen of the hotel is exselent,1
Highly recommend the city view rooms. they definitely don't disappoint üòä,1
The best thing in there was the housekeeping lady the best and the guy bring the fridge to our room because no fridge in the room when we check inMore than that checking that I was rude to secure people route the room cleaning now from 0 to 5 and give them one,0
We were upgraded to a King XL bedroom| amazing city views| comfortable bed and brand new bathroom.,1
Could not sleep all night bc too much like too much noise too loud every thing in building top of that they charge my account money also very mad very bad experience pay for parking also üò°,0
Loved the view from my room. Loved the fact that there was a hand held shower head. Would have appreciated a microwave in my room.,1
The room was disgusting. Stains all around the room in suspicious spots. Then the staff was rude when I was checking in. I had an issue with my wifi(that I paid for) and they didn't even attempt to help me.,0
Room with a view indeed! Corner room with spectacular| unobstructed views was breathtaking. Very clean. Friendly staff| most helpful| a few not so much. CONS: Website did not reflect that valet parking was not an option. Only said valet parking only. Tried calling the hotel multiple times in a week| never got an answer.,1
We had amaizing view from corner room on 35th floor. Pros was pillows smell and insufficient ventilation in the bathroom. Overall we had a great experience.,1
The shower didn't work and no one did a thing about it. Still paid the full price.,0
The view and room was not what we booked but it was ok for just one night,1
Staff were very rude| did not want to answer any questions,0
Stood for 3 days and couldn't sleep because there was a lot of noise inside the walls,0
Staff was not friendly at all.Place wasn't clean| a lot of dust all over.They don't have a vending machine in the property.Long line for checking in once we got the Room  we asked for a room upgrade| the manager asked us to make the line again. Nobody was helpful.,0
You can see the UN building and the EmpireStates Building. Beautiful night view.Easy to access the Grand Central Station.,1
The property was really clean the only problem is I paid for a room with a city view the windows you cant open them and there were too small. My partner and me we cant even enjoy the view. Overall it wasn't that bad,1
The room was a nice size and very clean. We stayed on the 35th floor and had a nice view.,1
This location is just simply immaculate. The upkeep| presentation| hospitality for the most part and amenities are just superb!,1
They charged my card $14.95 when my stay was already paid for through Expedia| when I called I was told that the charge was for the internet which I never used.After deliberation with the rude and condescending clerk| she agreed to refund the $14.95.She was rudely letting me know that all hotels in New York charges for wifi.,0
Everything was appealing to me i loved my stay from the entrance to checking in to entering the room and leaving,1
The property was spacious| clean| quiet and absolutely lovely,1
This hotel was absolutely filthy and rundown. It looks nothing like the pictures online. I took pictures of the hotel conditions and checked out immediately after checking in. Do not stay here! The carpets were stained| the hotel room had hair and filth all over the floor| the furniture was run down and looked like it was from good will. The carpet had not been vacuumed for weeks. Gross place,0
Amazing views! I would recommend to anyone in nyc. River views and city views. Stay in a corner room,1
I loved loved loved the view and how everything looked from the top. The room was the perfect size and even the bathroom was gorgeous!,1
I didn't like the fact that I walked into my room that was not cleaner or prepared for me even after booking in advance and then still coming after my check in time and completing the check in process before looking for parking.,0
I had a great stay at this hotel no complaints at all.,1
During our stay the first night was very cold and uncomfortable and the tv was broke they came to fix that,0
Very food...............................................,1
There was a vacuum cleaner in front of our door. There were no dace towels. A rose pedal was in the bed which indicated to us the sheets were not clean. The phone randomly rang at different times of the night with no one on the other line. Check in is at 4 and check out eleven... that's two hours less than other properties... ripOff. The room was nice but overall the hotel looked run down and stale. Hilton needs to update this lobby. We spent good money to stay and didn't get the same level of service as we would elsewhere,0
It's filthy| and My room wasn't cleaned properly at all. I wouldn't recommend this hotel especially during covid. It's unsafe for things to not be cleaned properly. I called house keeping 3 times and got to the same person and no one came. I spoke to two mangers and they did absolutely NOTHING for me.,0
Beautiful! Very clean| great staff. Very nice rooms!,1
Everything was perfect except that when I came in there was a little dirt on the ceiling but I cleaned it | but honestly it was beautiful and a great view as well | an amazing hotel honestly !!,1
No food no water basically nothing to eat or drink!,1
The stay was amazing probably the best hotel I've been too in the city. The room is so huge and spacious. The bathroom is perfect it has a separation area for the toilet it's self. The lighting is amazing as well. I will be back for sure,1
Location was great but the parking was awful. No microwave nor vending machines.  Other dan that it was fine,1
the view is very nice great location beautiful hotel,1
This hotel was in a beautiful location overlooking the city.,1
The corner king size room was beautiful| clean and it had an amazing view. The reception was not friendly at all. She did not welcome us| barely made eye contact and seem upset. The customer service should have been better.,1
Okay Nothing Special,1
Beautiful hotel| good service| but very expensive parking garages nearby. Most street parking in the surrounding blocks was reserved for diplomats since the hotel is by the United Nations building.,1
Everything was perfect no complaints was made to report,1
There's no parking. So if you're gonna chance it and park across the street| just know it's a $95 ticket.,1
Room was scrupulously clean. There was a lot of noise from some rooms. The doors really don't insulate the sound very well.  It's a bit unsettling to walk down a hallway and hear so much of people's lives.  Party walls were good| though.,1
First the front desk clerk came off very rude and when I was asking questions about my room she was very short and cute me off.   The hotel was nice the rooms could have been more cleaner like wiped down on the furniture old food stains were on the table and night stand windows needed a little glass cleaner other than thats the view was beautiful.,1
This hotel was amazing in every way. My boyfriend and I were very satisfied with the room and staff. Very nice| will definitely be back again!,1
Extremely dirty hotel.,0
Excellent view of the empire state building . Beautifully decored room amazing restaurant Patsy,1
No free wifi| the sheets were stained and the door of the bathroom had literal hand prints on them.,0
I liked the hotel itself| the staff and the location. I did not like the mass amount of disturbances in our floor. People going in and out. I tried to call the front desk but didn't get anyone. Also - the bathroom not having a fan is a HUGE mistake. Not to mention the shower head didn't work properly| we had to use the side extension which was very hard. The $15 per day internet charge is also a scam. I loved Hilton but this made me change my mind on that. Too much money over all for a fairly poor quality hotel.,0
Everything was good| but the front desk attendant at the check out time was very rude and with bad attitude. The stay was good| place is clean and comfortable| the location is very convenient| definitely the lobby area needs an update.,1
It was great. The view was phenomenal and the room was so comfortable. The only downside was the parking. There was a lot of parking lots but expensive. Other than that I enjoyed the trip.,1
Front desk was a bit rude when I called 2x before our stay| other than that everything was perfectly fine.,1
Very nice hotel but the walls are not sound proof so you'll hear everyone. Especially if your in the hallway. Staff was great. Amenities were closed because of covid,1
My stay was good| a reasonable location| not so close to the metro but a short distance depending on the line you would use| very good view from the room.,1
The check in receptionist was very friendly and the room was clean with an amazing view.,1
The stay here was lovely. I loved our room with city view. Close to everything,1
excellent| room was very clean and modern with a very nice view| would definitely recommend,1
The room was clean| the location was convenient| and the view was amazing from my corner king room.,1
It was amazing. My husband and I stayed in the corner King room.,1
Great Love it thanks,1
I live in the city and wanted to plan a small weekend getaway with my boyfriend. We had a king room and it looked exactly like the pictures. Due to COVID| the gym and restaurants including room service are unavailable| but you can order delivery to the hotel from Uber eats and more. Service was friendly and efficient. The carpet in the hallway was very dirty| like bleach was spilled and left a long trail throughout the hall. Other than that| the hotel is clean.,1
Wonderful hotel and wonderful view. I honestly loves staying at this hotel üíú,1
I loved the view and how spacious the room was! I enjoyed my time,1
This hotel is great. I got a corner room so the views were incredible. The staff up front was so great and helpful. The hotel itself is in a great place because its about a 5 minute walk to grand central station with access to all subways. There are also lots of places to eat within walking distance and coffee shops. I was there during COVID so not sure how their amenities are| considering they were all closed but such a great stay!,1
I had a wonderful staying at the hotel| I will stay anytime... thank you so much,1
Really nice hotel | I enjoyed it very much | would recommend| and only 30 min walk to Korean town !,1
Wonderful quiet hotel with incredible views! I love staying here,1
Thankful for putting us in a room with an amazing view.,1
I don't like they don't have parting .................,1
I had a really romantic and fun weekend| the hotel was really nice| romantic and I loved.Staff was really nice.I didn't like that I didn't have housekeeping the other day after so I had to change towels| linens myself.Other than that everything was perfect,1
Really liked! Clean| comfortable hotel. Will stay there next time too,1
Thank you!,1
Thank you for your excellent service as always.,1
I will definitely be staying here again. The views and customer service are unmatched.,1
The room was very spacious. I had an amazing view of downtown Manhattan as well as the East river. The elevator is very fast| your ears will pop. Check-in and check-out was quick and easy. I recommend this place!,1
Good room| but called home keeping plus front desk for some fresh sheets about three times and no one ever showed up or called to tell me what was going on. After some time I just got tired of complaining| only a two night stay.,0
Great welcome. Very accomadating. Courteous staff. Great price!!!,1
Great stay| friendly staff| great view .. checkout took a longer time,1
No water or ice machines throughout entire facility,0
The hotel stay was very pleasant and comfortable. The staff was very polite and helpful| the location was very convenient,1
Large rooms!!! Nice views!!! Was here during COVID-19 and they were very clean!,1
I was so nice !! I love the room | the service | everything .,1
Very clean and amazing view of the city. Close to many restaurants so amazing location. If you drive there however| the hotel does not have a garage so parking your car for your stay may be a concern. I found a paying garage near it however that was about a good 3 minute walk so there is a solution. Just would have been amazing if the hotel itself provided a parking area for its guests. Otherwise great experience. Would recommend and come back,1
So my room was on the 32nd floor... I get up there and my key didn't work. So I had to go back down to get a new one. Go allllll the way back up and that key didn't work. So security had to come change the battery on the door. I finally get into the room and it's nothing like the room advertised| it smelled like old cigarettes and they had no wash clothes in the room. Definitely won't stay there again.,0
Awesome hotel| nice view of city. I pretty sure recommend to my friends.,1
I loved the view and the room looked exactly like the pictures.,1
Nothing was unique about the building.Not the stag,0
Excellent house staff!!! From the front desk| to housekeeping| to management‚Äî they were all incredibly patient and accommodating to my requests. The view from my room was extraordinary and I would definitely stay there again!,1
Omg i loved the City view the staff the hotel very clean the rooms nice,1
The view was great. No ice machine though. The hotel was clean.,1
The rooms were very nicely set up| the lobby is beautiful| the hotel in itself is peaceful . I had a great stay ! Housekeeping was accommodating| desk staff amazing . No complaints | definitely will be a frequent customer.,1
The property is located close to major amenities and a safe neighbourhood.,1
Great room. Clean and spacious just how I like it!,1
Location was great. Views were nice. The price was also good. Rooms were clean. My only dislike was the carpets in the hallways were orange and dirty. The colors of the hallways were gray also making it kind of dark but my biggest dislike would be the dirty hallway carpets. However| rooms were nice and clean.,1
Great stay| friendly front desk!  i will definitely stay again,1
It's a five star and the management decided to keep it open. This been| there shud be adequate service available to guests. This Used to be high class location is now maintaining low budget motel standards! Expect more!!!!,1
The hotel is clean| safe| and almost close to tourist attractions. Times Square is like 20 min walking and the rest of the sites| I took an Uber. There is a good pizza spot and breakfast cafe close by. Due to Covid| they are not cleaning the room daily but you can ask for extra towels| etc.,1
Worst Experience Ever. Terrible. we booked a room for 3 people and they gave us a room for 2 people and they said Expedia put the wrong info at their end| Ver un,0
Nice place and location. Clean. No glasses or ice bucket. As a HH member - given WiFi and late checkout.,1
Great location in the sense that it's right next to the UN! The hotel offers great views of the river! Luxurious room amenities!,1
The quiet sunny  UN side of Midtown - staff is very upbeat and eager to serve and overcome the understandable limitations created by the pandemic. Thank you Hilton!,1
Unfortunately i had so-so experience. I booked city view room. Goods: view was alright and the room was spacious enough. Bad: cleaninness of the room (bad smell of vomit near the bed)| shower need maintenance| staff unfriednly and not helpful| all sanitizer boxes were empty| storage wasn't working and no one notified me so i had to care my luggage all day. Front desk did not care. As a customer do not recommend,0
I had an amazing experience. I highly recommend it,1
Great looking hotel but definitely need better attention and service especially with Covid room wise since got there my room wasn't clean  towels had stain i request new one didn't got them till i when again downstairs n ask no clean service provide next day bed shot dirty definitely suprice because great hotel,0
Check in was extremely slow. When I got there there was only one person at the desk. There was no line| just myself and my partner. She went into the back and we can just hear the chatter and laughing while we were waiting to be checked in.We finally got a room| headed up just to see that we were given a room that had not been cleaned. There was alcohol everywhere| sheets were a mess and gross| towels all over the floor.We headed back down to the desk and there was now a line. We waited a total of 45 minutes to receive a new room. The person at the desk was not pleasant nor welcoming.,0
The hotel was nice the gemtelman that check me in on saturday wasn't pleasant never told  me it was 100 accidental policy which is ok  he was like a robot not pleasant at all. Overal the stay was nice,1
Love the room i had And would definitely stay here again !!,1
The hotel was clean and very comfortable but the internet was not working for most of my stay but everything else was exceptional.,1
No parking. customer Service sucks. Would never stay here again,0
No parking at the time I went we just had to go up the street and pay for parking,1
I liked the view from my room and it seemed like there was security in front of the hotel every night so it felt safe. The only thing i disliked is I didnt get the room that was in the picture with the full window.,1
No.place to park and it cost almost half of the cost to to stay just to park my car for 24 hrs.  Get a garage,1
Good place,1
Very nice hotel highly recommended!! :) and love the location,1
Stayed two nights and will never come back Although the staff at front desk was friendly| it seemed he was the only guy working in the hotel. The skewed headboard and the dusk layers on the table showed the room had not been cleaned recently. There was no hair dryer in the bathroom and I called three times to both ‚Äúconcierge‚Äù and ‚Äúguest room service‚Äù line in the morning and waited for another hour for the hair dryer delivery. In the evening I called multiple times to ask about ice and no answer at all. During the pandemic the everything runs slowly but it's not an excuse of plunged service to have only couple of staff on duty for two giant hotel buildings.,0
Lovely location spotless clean very safe and comfy,1
The room smelled like cigarettes. Had pissed on the floor. And the rugs were stained with stuff that look like it was freshly spilled overall very unhappy,0
Only comment is that it would be nice if the room had a piece of furniture with drawers fit your clothes,1
Experience is great. I purchase an extra insurance (about 10$)I don`t know if it saved me a room but it worked out pretty good.We got a room at 31st floor (3124) which is the great view on lower Manhattan and Hudson River.A room was a bit tiny but this view.Love it.,1
Great accommodation rooms are not the best but nothing to complain about..,1
The view of the city warranted this stay,1
Wonderful hotel with great views! No complaints,1
I've stood in about 10 hotels within the last 2 weeks| this hotel is by far the best hotel experience I ever had ! The views were so amazing ! & the staff is by far the nicest people !! Not one bad thing I can say about this hotel,1
Hotel is in excellent condition| spacious room and great staff. Covid has affected the services (no food service) but menus are available. There is no parking that was disappointing and costly. Otherwise the stay was great. We stayed on the 31st floor and the view was amazing.,1
Loved the hotel very nice and clean| however I thought someone would clean the room when we left because that would be social distancing but no one did and there is literally nothing open not even the deli in the hotel. Other than that the hotel was nice and quiet and the view was amazing. There are no stores but around the corner is Duane Ried.,1
It was great. The view of the city was beautiful,1
One of the best hotel in the city. Our stay was phenomenal| outstanding and we can't wait to go back. It's super clean| very luxurious| very quiet and safe. This is our new go-to hotel.,1
Stayed to enjoys some views of the NYC skyline. We had a corner room and enjoyed views of the Chysler| Empire State and World Trade Center One buildings.  Billionaire row was easily in view also. We arrived to late at night to sample any on house dining or bar activities but the hotel does offer quite a few choices.,1
So clean and a pretty beautiful space.Exactly what it looks like in pictures| but the window is definitely misleading. The only thing I can complain about is the shower. There is only one glass panel and it doesn't slide over| so there was an issue with water flowing over. Other than that| highly recommend.,1
The city views at this hotel were amazing!! Great service,1
The front desk was the most welcoming. and friendly.,1
excellent !  I love this place is very very very nice,1
I enjoyed our room| I enjoyed the breakfast and the internet was better than expected. I have to point out the breakfast on the 30th floor; it was fantastic! Igor| Mohammed and a third team member who I cannot identify were fantastic!,1
Very disappointed. Paid extra to go in a corner room but it all corner rooms are conjoining and as a result the noise from the next room is really disturbing.  WiFi went down the second day which was inconvenient. Wouldn't stay here again!,0
Good location near Grand Central. Room was fine| really could only find fault with the heating controls which didn't work so was far too hot. That said| no free Wi-Fi in the bedrooms in this day and age.....,1
The view was amazing and the room was super clean . We enjoyed our stay there.,1
They need to clean better!! The bed needs to actually queen sizes.,0
It was a very pleasant stay for me and my girlfriend. We stay for 6 nights over New Years and had the most wonderful view of the city with buildings such as the Empire State and Chrysler in view. I do think the view was largely part of why our experience was excellent and of course| this is not always a guarantee. I would recommend emailing Hilton beforehand to request a certain view.,1
Location was great| staff friendly. Bar drinks expensive.,1
I love this hotel.. from the location| to the views| to the friendliness of the staff| to the food. Never has a single complaint and I've stayed there over several times,1
Overall hotel was dirty| especially the carpets. Very noisy location. Wouldn't go back.,0
Old| badly maintained| overpriced| overrated and zero service,0
We rented a suite to accommodate our adult daughter| the room was spacious|but|the pull out sofa was broken and so a roll-a-way was brought.  There went the space.  Also| had some trouble understanding the staff.  Though I'm sure they work hard|especially being a holiday weekend | their English was a struggle .,1
Fantastic concierge service| great room| nice view good location,1
Slight difficulty getting through on their phone system| I had to keep asking the operator to transfer me. Was as able to check in early though which was a huge help especially with a baby.,1
I thought our was amazing it was our anniversary and staff treated from well I would recommend This hotel to all my friends and family,1
The view was amazing and the room was great. Clean| comfortable| stylish. I never sit on the couch in hotels| but this one we did!,1
Phenomenal view.  Would return for that alone.,1
Hotel is modern| clean| staff is polite| best view from the room we had.,1
They overbooked our room| them put us in another room and on fallowing day move us from that room to another.The second nite the people on room next to us start to talk really loud and nasty ( we have kids).Really disappointed üòû,0
Room was very big| and the hotel was long on standard amenities that make it comfortable and convenient for business travelers.  Not trendy| but excellent and reasonably priced for the serious traveler.,1
Close to UN.  Efficient design.  Room very nice.  View from 35th floor of East River| city buildings was spectacular.  However| hallways looking worn.,1
No especial care from any of the staff,1
a few blocks from grand central station.  price was good.  booked room with ability to cancel without penalty.,1
The front desk staff were absolutely gracious and professional.  The Bell Captain - Ozzie - could not have been more helpful given my challenges of walking with a new knee.  He was knowledgeable and ye not overbearing with respect to his joy of working at this hotel for 40 plus years.  He was kind enough to introduce me to the general manager as I left.  Despite my desire to show my appreciation with a gratuity| he refused to accept it and said| the conversation about diplomacy with me had much greater value.  Pls. share with Ozzie my assessment.   Thank you,1
the front desk associate would not let me use the bathroom before I checked in and got my card. when I told him that I had been in the car for 4 hours and needed to use the restroom he made me check in | and then gave me a bathroom card| which he followed me to the bathroom and then made me give it back to him immediately. he said people came in and used them for their restrooms| and he wouldn't let me do that| even after I checked in.,0
I had a reservation for 3 nights my flight was delayed and had a late arrival.  due to the rain they had roof leaks and sold out on rooms and to my surprise had no room and my daughter and I had to sleep in the lobby till 5 am and was told I would get a refund on first night which hasn't happened. And when I asked abt my refund at check out the person was so rude about it and said they didn't charge the first night when they actually did.,0
Everything was perfect other than that a bath plug won't work by which I could not soak in the bath. So bummed out...,1
Very comfortable room| wonderful view.  Service was very straight forward and business like. Clean and located wonderfully.,1
The room was huge| and bedding was very comfortable. We would definitely stay here again,1
Excellent location and close to UN. Excellent front desk staff| very helpful and respond quickly.,1
Everything was wonderful| beautiful hotel and friendly staff,1
Staff a little surly on check in | otherwise all ok,1
Great location and a really nice view. Our room was a nice size and the bed was super comfy.,1
It was a good 2 days that we had in the hotel they had an event going on| was crowded but fin,1
The staff was so nice and patient with me. No matter the question they had a very helpful answer. First time staying at this location and i can definitely see myself doing it again.,1
Our room was so spacious and looked recently renovated. Had a fantastic view of the Empire State Building from our room. Bed was comfortable and room clean. Staff very helpful| and the cafe on site was good for coffee and snacks. Room service for food was only during limited hours| and didn't have much to choose from. Location was really close to central station| only a 5-10 minute walk away. Would stay again,1
I loved the rooms and the amazing city views. I also found the customer service & friendliness of the staff (including the bellmen| the front desk staff & housekeeping staff) to be particularly stellar!,1
Great location over looking the United Nations Building. Easy access to the centre of Manhattan located on 44th St straight walk into Time Square.Hotel has amazing views of the city and recommend booking the corner rooms.,1
Everyone was very helpful and courteous   Great location,1
WOW!! not this is a hotel!! smells great! great location! great accommodations !! great GREAT room and the VIEW!! loved and enjoyed everyday!!,1
The room and view were fantastic.,1
The hotel overall was good| but comfort wise was not that great. The a/c in our room didn't work properly and it was super humid and warm. After complaining for the 3rd time| we were given a discount on the room.,1
Everyone was very helpful and accommodating to all of our requests. We didn't have a King size room and we asked to see if we could upgrade. The front desk girl was supper helpful and got us a king size room on the top floor with a view of the city. It was perfect. We could see the Chrysler Bldg and the Empire State Bldg from our window.,1
Very basic hotel and more like a 3 star. Room had continuous drilling or a jack hammer noises that wouldn't stop beyond 11pm. Got stuck in the elevator and it was one of the worst experiences ever.,0
Rooms were nice and clean| and staff were friendly and a pleasure to interact with. Overall a nice and enjoyable experience.,1
The city view is amazing stuff was great all in all was great experience,1
We like it because it's in ther quiet side of Midtown Manhattan. The staff are very friendly.,1
Rooms large| just a little tired| other than that it would be a beautiful hotel,1
So if you are disabled| mobility impaired| or travelling with older relatives do not use this hotel,0
Amazing| polite & professional staff/ workers. All very welcoming & helpful. Room was great however carpet in room needs to be replaced.. definitely old & outdated. Hotel gym has a great view.. and has machines & weights to get the job done. Overall| we will return to this property.,1
Good location and clean rooms.I did have a great view of sunrise over the East River,1
The decor of the lobby was beautiful|the staff were friendly.     The only thing i didn't like was there was only expresso in the room with no option for coffee,1
+It was very quiet and close to the subway.-There wasn't much shopping near by the hotel.,1
Nice location| good view| Hilton standard but wifi more or less didn't work in our room all 4 days and nights we stayed at this 5 star Hilton and no one felt responsible. They said: wifi is free so if it doesn't work it doesn't matter. For a business hotel it's not a convincing answer.,1
The toilets were cool.  Never used a bidet before.  $15 for internet?  Ridiculous!,1
Hotel was great except the staff. Staff( receptionist) was not friendly and did not even look at my eye while talking. She left even before I finished the question about the room. Someone else next to her answered it for me. Internet was not working somehow throughout the stay(despite going through the correct steps with the help of the guy on the lobby of the hotel),1
I liked the location. I didn't like the limited dining in menu. The customer service wasn't the best but the manager made up for it at checkout.,1
We have been staying at the Millenium for the last Four years.  We live everything about it.  The hotel| staff and location are FABULOUS.  Try it out| you won't regret it!,1
An amazing and excellent place to stay in the heart of the city,1
Perfect location to attend UN meetings. Rooms are spacious. Very comfortable and clean.,1
Amazing views from the rooms| clean and friendly staff.,1
All in all a great hotel to stay at. After spending 5 nights in New York where we were doing 20k steps a day| we wish it was closer to the Metro.,1
The location is fantastic. We usually stay further up near the park| but from now on this is where we will stay. The room had a fantastic view. It was very comfortable. The only thing I wasn't that happy about was that to get ice| we had to call the bellmen and it seemed as if that was not a part of their job that they liked. It also took a long time for them to bring up the ice. I would much prefer to be able to get it myself. I would say that every staff member I encountered was very nice and helpful except the bellmen. They were not helpful when I arrived| and were just neutral throughout the stay. They were standing around talking at night when I'd arrive back from a walk| and never greeted me. I think having more friendly members of your staff greet your guests would have been an added plus.,1
 The one drawback always experience has difficulty with the Wi-Fi. It is often spotty| frequently takes a very long time connect,1
While the green marble to me back to the days of the Carrington's| the staff and the shape of the hotel were delightful.,1
We booked for two nights. The room was great| the bed was comfy and staff was pleasant and helpful. I would stay here again!,1
We felt truly comfortable| we will return. We recommend it completely.,1
It was in a location I had never stayed before in NYC. The views were spectacular! People were helpful and friendly. We enjoyed our stay,1
Extremely satisfied with this property. Incredible view| clean and modern rooms| and quiet. It was so great we wish we could have spent more than just the weekend to explore everything the hotel had to offer. Beds were super comfortable and everything  was amazing for such a fair price in NYC. Close to the subway too. Recommended to all our family and friends.,1
Great Location with great views| only 5 min walk from Grand Central,1
Great location| could walk to everything. Lots of shopping and restaurants near by. Room was ok was on the east river side great view but room could have been updated more. Park on the street cost for valet is to high and you don't have in and out privileges. Didn't eat the breakfast because that is pricey as well there is plenty of places to eat near by.,1
it is good and pleasant close to the united Nations,1
Nice room|great views|friendly staff. 15 min walk to 5th ave,1
The views from room 3727 were breathtaking! Corner room on the 37th floor and it was truly marvelous!,1
Great views and location! The breakfast at the lounge could have had more selection but was sufficient.,1
Fantastic view of downtown Manhattan from the 32nd floor !,1
Beautiful and clean building. Linens were heaven to sleep on.,1
I will never again use Hotels.com for my hotel reservations.,0
Perfect location with an incredible view.,1
Love the hotel | really friendly staff and super very safe area will stay again   !,1
Spent memorial weekend with my husband celebrating our anniversary. We had an amazing view room. I was missing the microwave. Room wad OK about the size. Service wad great.,1
I liked the location of this hotel. I didn't like that fact that the hotel is outdated.,1
Horrible decor and design. Over priced for its condition.,0
I checked in on Sunday May 19th and checked out May 2oth 2019. Although I had prepaid my booking with Hotels.com I was charged USD$400.00 as a preauthorization in case I had a late checkout. Upon checking out as no late checkout 4 days later the USD400.00 hold was released and only charged the USD$55.00 for parking. All good untill a USD$286.88 showed up as a hold on a late checkout that never happened. I called Millenium Hilton and they indicated it was a mistake and charges were to be reversed ASAP. On the next day charges were still there and once again I asked Hotels.com to handle the matter. They were told a FLAT LIE| and to this date I am veing charged a second time for something that never happened. Either Hotels.com is in cohoots or the Hilton really needs the money. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!!!,1
Very Beautiful facilities. Would have like to have a full bar but very nice nonetheless. Excellent staff support and super friendly. We felt extremely at home from the front desk| to the doorman to the Housekeeping Staff. Can't wait to see them all again!,1
We really enjoyed our stay there. Great rooms| view| location and staff.,1
Family reunion.  The hotel was very elegant and the wrap around windows and views were amazing,1
Location for us is perfect|would  come back for sure next year,1
Amazing!  This property was super friendly and helpful| I felt right at home right away.  All of the staff made me feel welcome and was so nice.  I would definitely recommend this as a place to stay!!  xoxox,1
All we knew was that it is an not so cheap hotel near the U.N. Plaza. As we arrived| Robert greeted us and| suddenly| the hotel became friendly. The check-in was quick| we asked for a room at an upper floor and we received one on the 37-th. The view was breathtaking| the room large and clean| the wi-if pretty fast. Waking up in the morning was a unique experience| the first thing we saw being the Manhattan skyline. We had breakfast across the street| at Mona's. The Central Station is two blocks away but the neighborhood is quiet and safe.,1
Views was exceptional great location friendly staff,1
Blood stains on comforter,0
Nice hotel| room was amazing| really large - overlooking NYC and Empire State Building - just exactly what I was after for celebrating my husbands 40th.  The gym was ideal with modern cardio and weight equipment and an amazing view of the river and the city.  Young lady on guest relations was a disappointment| very unhelpful| unfriendly and poor customer service| otherwise everyone else was very welcoming and pleasant.  Close enough to Grand Central to catch the subway and found a couple of lovely places for breakfast and dinner along the way.  Would definitely return here in future.  Its a shame that you charge for wifi (unless sat in Reception where it is free)| wifi is somewhat considered a given now in prestigious hotels.  Really like the in room option to bluetooth the music on your phone to the television sound system - that worked really well.  Just a shame no free wifi to support it.,1
"Upon check in we noticed that the ""double beds"" were smaller than what we thought we booked.  When we spoke to the manager| Tai| she was very unprofessional| rude and unapologetic.  She told us that was their idea of a double bed.   We did speak Steve who is also a manager the next day and he was very nice and considerate.  I visit NY very often and will not be staying at this hotel again.",0
Friendly FOH staff - we've stayed there often. Quiet as rooms only start on floor 28. Associated restaurant good but expensive,1
I liked the friendly people who greet you in. I did not appreciate the lack of sensitivity at the check-in to my late arrival.I liked the room view. I didn't like the long wait with other guests for the elevator on 37th floor for 20 min without a practical reason. I enjoyed the restaurant buffet...hostess was excellent and assumed the needs without interaction...caused us to go back the next day...,1
Hotel was great| just should have booked one closer to midtown.  We ended up doing far too many cabs to get places.  Could not believe there was no WiFi included in price.  I joined Hilton honors to get free WiFi.,1
Clean and overall good stay. Overpriced for early check-ins,1
good place. good service| good location. needs better access to pick up food.,1
Everything about the hotel was amazing| the only thing we found as a slight negative is that there weren't subway stations nearby that we could see but everything was perfect. Comfy bed and pillows| excellent view (we had the king size room with a view of the Hudson) although we did ask for a room with a view of the NY skyline hence booked a king size room (which we didn't get but we didn't mind).,1
The views are amazing.,1
I was only here a day. The staff were courteous and accommodated my early check in. The room was nice and clean. Overall a positive experience.,1
Great location| valet parking| staff helpful|  friendly|  informative!,1
Location| friendliness and convenience.  Hotel well keept.,1
Our stay was beyond amazing| location was great walking distance to everything| the check in process was wonderful I was actually able to check in 2-3 hours early with no extra charge. They held our luggage before and after our check out times. The staff was wonderful so nice and helpful. I would definitely stay at this hotel again and highly recommend it.,1
Very helpful and pleasant staff. Rooms were clean and nicely decorated. Small| but to be expected in NYC,1
Hi I just wanna is a great time yyyyyy was a great time for y'all and we were going on a walk with you and you guys and we can talk tomorrow morning so I will have to tyyyyyy the next week or so,0
Quick stay in route back home.  Great location| clean room and great staff,1
Close to the UN headquarters and very convenient to transportation,1
Great location|clean.Lacking restaurant and is really a business hotel.However fab views from top floor.Would recommend.,1
The heart of Manhattan| Broadway| Fifth Avenue etc|  within walking distance.Breakfast was over-priced at $43.00 and should really have been included.A refrigerator/mini-bar would have been useful| as would a towelling robe.,1
Great view and personnel were efficient and professional,1
Amazing location| staff was so friendly| and the rooms are perfect.,1
Really clean| nice place and the staff was very friendly and professional,1
The bed and bedding was terrific| you get a huge flat screen| the internet is above average and housekeeping was terrific.,1
Just a quick getaway to see a couple of Broadway shows and museums.,1
Beautiful hotel  great views corner room on 33 floor.,1
Great location| nearly to best NY places Poor customer service. Exemption of Brandon| the policeman and his fantastic dog| all others attendants were unsatisfactory,1
Great stay only one night clean very up to date and close to time square would definitely stay again,1
Location was within walking distant to area we wanted visit,1
Very positive experience. The only area that needs obvious and immediate improvement is an increase in staffing at the check-in / check-out.,1
Our room was nothing like the photo we seen on Expedia housekeeping was awful we order pizza the pizza was still there until we threw it out the bed sheets had stained the bathroom had an awful urine smell that was coming out of the toilet the towel we will use was put back it was switched out for a clean one the carpet had toenail clipping and wasn't even vacuumed our room was pretty awful and tiny we asked if we can get another room and they told us no I wouldn't come back to this hotel and Expedia should have updated photos cause our room wasn't even close to the photos they have on their website. I am really disappointed,0
I felt that the facility was well run| there was nothing that i would change.  It was clean and well appointed.,1
The view from the 30th floor was incredible. I enjoyed being able to log into my own Netflix account while at the hotel. The location was superb.,1
Very nice hotel in a great location. We'd definitely stay again.,1
Great View of New York City! Hotel was clean. The staff was helpful and professional.,1
Slightly smaller rooms but well maintained and clean,1
One of the Best Hotel stays ever ! The staff was incredibly helpful| friendly and professional. The room was great but the view was amazing. HIGHLY Recommend !!,1
First time in New York| on arrival the reception staff and luggage people were very rude.  No information available in lobby about things to do. No information in room.  It seemed very unorganized and nobody seemed to be enjoying working there. First impressions count . They need to work on their customer service in all areas of the hotel .,0
The location is good and the views are impressive. It has a gym| but the elevator access to this is a little bit problematic as only 2 elevators go to the gym| but there is no way to specially call those elevators| and this could cause delays.  That issue could be solved.  The condition of the gym itself was OK| but some equipment was out of service (who knows for how long) and other prices quite old| but better than nothing!  Also had great views.,1
Fine hotel. Clean and comfortable. Close to Grand Central.,1
The concierge couldn't have been more pleasant| or more helpful. Everything about our stay went smooth as silk. Wait. To use the WiFi| you had to be (or become) a rewards member. Fine‚Äîit didn't cost anything to sign up| although we're not likely to ever reap any rewards...,1
The check in process was painful!!  They never staffed more than two people even though it was holiday season in NYC.  The location of the hotel is nothing to get excited about unless you had business at the UN.  The accessible room I reserved was not accessible. That meant another 45 min of messing around to get settled.  The 3 nights I reserved via Hotels.com was sent to the hotel as one 2 night reservation and 1 single night reservation.  That meant our room cards did not work after two days.  More waiting in line at reception to get new cards.  Overall| an adequate property. Nothing special. No exceptional service|  It isn't cheap.  Look elsewhere .,0
Nice hotel a few blocks from grand central station| great location away from the crowds.,1
No free internet inside the roomsI was pay 150$ taxt fee more,1
amazing and cozy beautiful hotel,1
Overall the property was nice. However the hotel kitchen host       was quite rude.,1
We stayed for three nights and it was a great stay! Hotel staff was great| the room was very spacious| the bed was very comfortable and the view was great also.There were a couple of minor issues in the room that were immediately addressed.We had breakfast in hotel and enjoyed that also! I would definitely stay here again!,1
Nice hotel. The staff was friendly. We had a great view of New York,1
Good hotel close to best part of NY| Empire State| Chrysler Building| 5th Avenue etc.,1
Staff were absolutely helpful and the location made it easier to access other parts of the city that isn't the usual Times Square. Great choice especially during Christmas time.,1
This was my 1st time in New York and my stay at your hotel was AMAZING!!,1
Everything was perfect! Friendly staff! The location of the hotel is only a 20mn wall to time square. It's located on a not so busy side of manhattan and the view off my window (room 3708) was great! Definitely coming back!,1
Great location| staff and room! They do good the extra mile for all their guests. Will be back!,1
Very very nice and very good  5  star Very close anywhere very quiet neighborhood And before they very nice,1
Most amazing room| spacious| clean and a priceless view....,1
Great hotel. Loved the room - big! Great closet and bathroom size. Can't beat the price for NYC.,1
Hotel staff very friendly and accommodating. Room nice and clean. Close to train station Grand Central in walking distance.,1
Room was really spacious; more than most NYC hotels that I have stayed in. Quiet neighborhood. Front desk was really crowded probably due to holiday season.,1
WE ARRIVED 9 PM| AND OUR ROOM WAS NOT READY. WE HAD TO WAIT 20 MIN BUT THE FRONT DESK GAVE US COMPLIMENTARY BREAKFAST.  VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THAT,1
Beautiful hotel! Amazing view. The room was very clean. Only gripe it is was difficult to find! There isn't much by way of the name of the hotel in a place you can see it. We basically just followed others with suitcases. I'd stay here again for sure though.,1
Very nice experience. I wish I could set the air beyond 23 degrees though.,1
Upon check in the clerk sent us to the wrong wing of hotel and on a goose chase up a tall tower many stories up  in scary elevator looking for room. Back to the lobby we went. Bell desk helped point us in right direction after. Got all the way up to room (another hike in scary elevator) and arrived to a very run down| lack luster room. Not meeting that Hilton standard. Called front desk. Phone just rand & rang & rang & rang & rang. Transferred twice. Finally was put in touch w/ manager Arika. She corrected everything and went above & beyond with excellent customer service. I give her all credit for turning sour experience around!! She put us in a new room and had bellman help w/moving rooms. Offered free breakfast for our 3 night stay. New room had spectacular views & very spacious & clean room. Totally updated from the other. A million times better!!Thank you| Arika! And the two lovely bellman who have been w/the property 40+years. They were a delight. Breakfast had nice spread but didn't taste the best. Location isn't near anything-- two thumbs down for proximity to sights unless you are there to see UN.,1
Staff is superb. The bellmen are outstanding| Ainsley| Edward; all of them. Avery is awesome at the front desk.,1
Amazing accommodations they treated us like the duke and duchess of York üíï,1
Stay was great. Staff was friendly| helpful| and accommodating. The view from our room was very nice. Room itself was clean.,1
Beyond our expectations. .  View was amazing and staff were all very pleasant |would certain stay there again.b,1
Great inviting|cordial| professional staff.stayed here last month and experience was so wonderful I chose to come back!,1
We booked a room for 3 adults but the room was only set up for two. There was no water or milk for coffees. My friend had to sleep on the floor because a third bed was not supplied despite us checking  at the front desk and explaining the room was not big enough for three people. In fact the receptionist put the phone down on us which was very rude!!!  Overall a rubbish experience for our one night in New York despite the hefty ¬£338 price tag for the night. Would never recommend this hotel and I would like to point out that they blamed Expedia for the mess up!,0
The hotel fulfilled a special request and had a yoga mat waiting in the room. Their attention to detail is amazing.,1
The breakfast was explained to be a buffet and it was a Continental breakfast at most.. Nothing with eggs were available.. Nothing warm on the buffet.. Unless you count coffee.. Very disappointed,0
There were some annoyances| but overall we enjoyed our stay and would return.  Annoyances: The front desk did not answer the phone when I tried to call ahead twice between flights to warn of our very late arrival. There were some overlooked maintenance issues: the mini fridge did not work| the fancy toilet control had dead batteries. But on the positive side| our room was there when we arrived; Maintenance responded nearly instantly and replaced the fridge; the room was quiet| comfortable and clean; the room had windows that OPENED (a rare thing in high-rise hotels!) so we could enjoy fresh air; and housekeeping was extremely attentive (made rounds in the morning to refresh the (Illy!) coffee supplies| always available for clean towels| etc). The view of the city from our room on the 30th floor was stunning. The hotel has extra security measures due to its location across the street from the UN: these include a circle of bollards outside the front door| and card-key activated elevators-- and the world's most adorable luggage-sniffing pooches! We looked forward to encountering them each time we went through the lobby.  The caf√© in the lobby serves excellent Illy coffee drinks and breakfast pastries/snack items| and the staff were delightful. The location is a very short walk to Grand Central Station| and the neighborhood features many restaurants| from budget to high-priced| as well as a colorful Irish bar (open until 4 AM) with a genuine Irish bartender.,1
Everything was very clean and location was perfect. Parking was a little tough but staff helped with all needs and transportation,1
Our stay was amazing! They upgraded our room and gave us a view of the East River. The staff was friendly and welcoming. The room was clean and well stocked with essentials. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to stay at a nice hotel without breaking the bank.,1
Great staff and great location. We'd stay again.,1
Excellent hotel - my girlfriend and I enjoyed a 34th floor king room with great north-facing views. Rooms were immaculate| quiet and spacious and hotel is a short walk to all the mid-town attractions. Staff was extremely friendly and attentive. I would absolutely stay here again!,1
Nice hotel and nice view| the staff very good I recommended,1
Stayed for the NYC marathon. Everyone at the hotel was amazing !,1
Friendly staff| ultra clean sanitizes bathroomsGreat location,1
Perfectly located and great views,1
Impressive views of the skyline and wonderful location.,1
Very nice hotel| staff was very very helpful| courteous and friendly. I would definitely recommend!,1
|great location| nice room front desk staff ok| could have been more helpful. no concierge at 9 pm,1
Close to areas we wanted to see (Theatre District| UN| GCS (& subway),1
Because of its proximity to Grand Central Station| the UN| and cafes| restaurants| etc. the Millenium Hilton's One UN Plaza location is lovely.  The hotel is clean and comfortable| secure (guard with a dog at the entrance) and| the views are spectacular.  All in all| a nice hotel at an affordable price,1
Great place with excellent location| very friendly staff.,1
We've stayed at this hotel numerous times| always a beautiful view.  Whether of the Chrysler building| the East River or downtown.,1
the hotel was very comfortable it felt like home I would definitely recommend this hotel to anybody who is traveling to New York City I like the staff and the location was perfect,1
Amazing views and timely staff! I would highly recommend!,1
The property was very nice and in a great location. One of the bad aspects of our stay were the beds. We requested a double-bed room| but the size of the two beds were equivalent to a twin bed. That was the only downfall of our stay. Other than that the bellhop was amazing and the hotel was very clean.,1
Door bell gentlemen were friendly and super helpful.  they went above and beyond and made the overall experience great.Just with the pillows were more comfy.,1
Needed a quick place to stay and it was beyond my expectations. Thanks again,1
Attempt to check in early understandably denied but not without an unsolicited offer to upgrade with a fee. Poor communication and attentiveness to consumer concerns.,0
The area around the hotel is very safe. But I have been to NYC 3 times and at least on Manhattan found the city to be veruy safe.,1
No minibar| no snacks on site at night| restaurant closed during the day| poor service - waited 5 - 10 minutes every time I needed anything from the front desk. No Honors check in special service...Very surprised how bad the service was.,0
A 10min wall to Grand Central located next to the UN but otherwise surrounded mainly by embassies and consulates so quiet. Stayed on the 38th floor with great views over the city. Restaurant and cafe in the hotel were pricey and so many better options available,1
Kudos to all staff always reasy to greet and welcome,1
Very nice room.  Staff very nice.  Bring your own water bottle; none in room and no after hours aility to buy any.,1
Beautiful coean hotel with friendly helpful staff. Gret location|convenient to shopping and restaurants,1
What a joke lol| lived at hiltons all across the world. By far the worse hotel possible. 1 hour late for checkout at noon| charges $50 late checkout fee. Don't all hotels usually check out at 12? If not why not call and remind? Room that was ‚Äúnewly renovated‚Äù looked old and torn| asked for a room change to the older west tower that my friend was staying at but they couldn't ‚Äúgaurantee‚Äù a room even though I booked the hotel for four days. They told me to go down each morning to check for availability.,0
Very near to everything like subway| shops but the staff were so rude and unfriendly,1
I did not like that my reservation was given away and I did not even get to check in. After event I came to check in and was told due to high occupancy my room was unavailabe and I wouldn't be able to check in but other accommodations were made at another hotel. The other hotel did not offer room service or similar accommodations in my opinion at least plus it was 1am and I had just finished partying all night long so they said we could cancel at no charge. I told the manager we had decided to nacelle and her response was ‚Äúthat's great news!‚Äù Yea great for you because you got out of doing your job but was it great for the customer who reserved a room to crash at after an event who is now stranded in NY and has to find a train back to Long Island at a time when all train lines are not in service. Beware when booking through this property and this site since they don't actually ‚Äúreserve‚Äù a room for you!!!,0
Nice hotel great service clean bathroom and the view was nice too,1
Very clean and convenient location. Very quick service from the housekeeping.,1
Nice hotel| friendly staff... very clean plus amazing views of the city,1
Have always loved this property and it's location. It's like living in the neighborhood without being surrounded by commercial/retail properties. The un plaza is a stunning backdrop for walking on 1st Ave.,1
Disappointed by the lack of services: was not advised about needing to ask for the cleaning of the room! No gym.  Prices at the caf√© are very expensive. The staff very friendly though (thank you all),1
In every hotel room there should be drinking water .. But there should also be good covers in winter time.  They don't have that.  But everything else is fine.,1
Everything was very clean. And following procedures.,1
I stayed one week and found it well-located in midtown. Silent Location. Rooms are bigger than in many other Hotels in Manhattan. Nice bar for a last drink. I did not use the restaurant| therefore I can't rate it. A nice coffee shop at the Lobby with very friendly staff. Room was very clean| staff absolutely friendly and helpful. Appro. 8-10 minutes walk to Central Station trains/subway. WiFi does work perfectly. I had a room on floor 32 and the view was spectacular (you should ask for a room in the upper floors if available).,1
Amazing view of the One World Trade Center| memorial| and the bay,1
Dirty Dirty Dirty my room was soDirty that they had to change my room and that was dirty too. Glad the manager saw this. Will be requesting a full refund!!! Beautiful view and location but Filty,0
Amazing view. Staff was great and friendly,1
Well I booked a room with a bath separated from the shower but I got a connected bath and shower and the room wasn't as I thought,0
Rooms need to be upgraded. Views beautiful,1
Great location.Property maintenance left some to be desired. Not all elevators working. Lobby closed.Refrigerators disconnected in roomsSome staff did not seem to be up to par with amenities.,1
The carpet is full of stains. It's outdated. The lobby had a bad smell.,0
I rented two Jr suits and they were both very deteriorated and dirty.I opened the small refrigerator inside the room and a horrible smell came out| aperently had being off for quite a while and probably wet inside.I gave my Hilton Honors number and the person at the front desk said he could not register those nights because I had made the reservation through Expedia and not through the Hilton web page.,0
Overall| I'd rate this as a good hotel and would stay there again.  We did have a few issues| but it wasn't anything that were deal breakers.  It was advertised that parking was less than 1000 ft and when I spoke with the front desk verifying the parking situation| I was told yes| they have parking and it was $64 a night.  We got there| the parking deck beside the hotel was shut down and the gentleman working the front desk didn't know what the other associate was talking about.  We still found a deck a block and a half away after searching around.  Second issue| we booked a junior suite and when we went to check in were told they no longer had any suites available.  They wanted to comp us with two connecting room| but I explained it was a trip with my husband and a second room would just be wasteful.  They then instead gave us a high-rise room.  The views from the room were beautiful.  All in all| the rooms are a little dated| but even after the confusion with the parking and booking| we loved the location| loved the views and would book there again.,1
not clean at all| uncomfortable beds| bathroom dirty and dingy,0
The view is very beautiful,1
Fabulous views of downtown NYC!,1
There was a soap box that was stuck to the ceiling of my shower l| looks like it has been there for a while. I don't know how that goes unnoticed when making sure a room is cleaned for a new guest to stay in. Makes me sick to my stomach knowing that if that was left on the ceiling what else isn't clean in the room. I have taken a picture of the box that is somehow stuck to the ceiling of the shower and if you want a picture of it i am more than happy to send it to whoever reaches out to me. That was really gross and I would like to get a refund for my room. I think the least to expect when staying at a hotel is a clean room and my room was not clean. Especially in times like now with covid I would think hotels were being more cautious about how clean the rooms are to avoid spreading but I guess your hotel isn't. Please refund me for the room.,0
"It is in a great location with great views.  Housekeeping service was excellent.  I marked ""amenities"" only as pleasing because of some restrictions still due to Covid.  Lots of good restaurants in the area with many shopping opportunities.  We had a great visit.",1
This hotel was amazing I have never been to New York and I'm so glad we picked a great location! Directly across from the World Trade Center memorial| east subway access and a safe and clean area. I will definitely be staying here again for my next visit thank you Millennium Hilton !,1
I expected more from The Millineum.They really need to invest in some upgrades.,1
Proximity to wtc,1
Good service overall.,1
Very powerful aura around and in this hotel! Beautiful property and very clean rooms,1
clean and comfortable place.,1
There was a roach in my room but they immediately gave me the option to switch my room and gave me a nicer view on the 40th floor. And the lady at the front desk was very nice about it and understanding. So I did appreciate that. I do wish the pool/spa or atleast the bar downstairs could be open. But I can understand given the covid restrictions. Overall it was a decent stay and the staff was polite.,1
Prefect location. Next to World Trade Center. Beautiful view from room. Pleasant and helpful staff.,1
Parking off site. No valet. No dining areas open yet in hotel. No little store with snacks available in hotel.room was nice. Had a great view of tower..room was clean. Toilet very very low so would be hard for elderly.,1
Amazing customer service| and the room was clean. But the beds need to be updated| pillow soft would be nice. Also| my room had light bulbs out| the refrigerator was broken. The cleaning lady was amazing.,1
Great location if you want to visit downtown and stay close to financial district. It has many good food options and is very close to The battery and south street seaport.,1
I was very disappointed with the overall experience at this hotel. Very very bad service and cleanliness. They didn't do my room service and said there was nothing they could do about it| the toilet was clogged. Only positive thing was the view.,0
GHETTO! Hotel rundown| interior of rooms beat up and outdated. Tv did not work| people staying near our room were extremely loud in late hours of night. So disappointed| surprised in quality of hotel for it being near 911 memorial. Would never stay here or recommend this hotel.,0
Stayed one night in June. Location was great - across the street from the Oculus and WTC memorial. The room was clean and quiet and the staff was friendly. None of the issues mentioned by other reviews. Also| there is a pop up outdoor beer garden across the street. Have a drink and a bite to eat under the new WTC 1,1
Room 2011 was dirty| the sofa had stains. The carpet was filthy and stains on the bed spread. I have been waiting for a refund from hotels.com of $472.77 and I have been given the run around. Both experiences were upsetting and unprofessional. I will never do business again with either company,0
The rooms are old| and need a deep cleaning. If you're traveling with a group you won't have any place to sit| talk and eat.| they have no amenities available. I was attacked by a non hotel guest outside the hotel while trying to eat outside had we had some indoor seating it would've been avoided. Until they deep clean the rooms and open some amenities| I don't recommend.,0
2 night stay in New York & was disappointed in the condition of the facility. The room was dusty| we requested blankets that we did not receive until we called a second time- the next day. Apparently rooms are only serviced per request (which is the opposite of what is customary) The fan was blowing hot air| had difficulty reaching front desk through the phone. I spoke to a woman at the front desk who was helpful but besides that this experience was not worth the $636 dollars.,0
Great location on the financial district,1
One of the best views and really friendly staff.,1
The view from my suite was awesome. The room had a plenty of room and the hotel was close to the subway and major attractions. I didn't like that the room was outdated| sink was clogged up| the elevators needed maintenance| and there were absolute no amenities made available. I would definitely stay again simply because of the views of the Brooklyn Bridge and how close it is to the subway and major attractions.,1
Great stay even if itnwas only.one day.  View was incredible!  Had a view of Ground Zero and the new World Trade Center.,1
This place is horrible the rooms are so nasty and dirty it was unbelievable how dirty the rooms was the reception workers was so unprofessional i pay almost 300 dollars for a disgusting room the furniture was broken the fridge wasn't working no water at the rooms no air-conditioning ssshhh was crazy,0
This Hotel denied finding my reservation even when I provided my Expedia confirmation number| the staff didn't show any interest in help solve the problem even when they saw I had a 1 year old baby with me that needed a place to rest.,0
Great service,1
Loved the view of the WTC,1
After a long drive to this hotel| we were upset to find the parking lot was closed| after that we had to find off site parking and walk back with our luggage. The room was just OK but the carpet seem to have a blood or a big wine stain| the TV is extremely outdated| no WIFI| mini fridge didn't work| the phones didn't work. The pool was closed| as well as the convenient store. And to top it off| the service was awful| you have to show your room key before entering the hotel| the lady asking for room keys had a terrible attitude and was yelling at everyone. I'm confused how this hotel got 4 stars. Will never stay at a Hilton ever again.,0
Lobby unfriendly and ineffective (first room given was not cleaned from previous occupants)Loud neighbors Dirty underwear found in a drawer in the second room Housekeeping came 2 days after we asked for itAC brokenSmells like some now-legal substance was heavily smoked by previous occupants,0
The only thing that was great about this room what is the view everything else was terrible the room looked Like it was falling apart in my point of you but in reality the couch bed was dirty some of the cabinets in the room had chipped drawers| There were stains on the bed.,0
When I checked-in| I was informed that all building amenities were closed. TV in the room didn't work so they moved me to another room with a broken minifridge that had old orange juice in it. When I wanted to reheat my takeout| I called the front desk and was told they had no more working microwaves. The water pressure in the shower was also shockingly low. Had to go down multiple floors for a working ice machine.  The room was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. Overall disappointing for a 4-star Hilton.,0
Stained carpets| worn and dented furniture| old fixtures| nonfunctioning tv and phone.....a long time favorite has lost its appeal| depressing.............,0
Place is really nice| solid view and all that fun stuff. The mini fridge didn't work and was broken looking inside. Not the end of the world. Would for sure recommend the place to friends and family.,1
Horrible service,0
I love the staff. They were very pleasant. Didnt like the parking was off site.,1
None smoking residence. View from the room,1
The room was very clean and the view was spectacular. Will definitely stay there again!,1
I didn't like that the staff there treated me differently because I'm a black women,1
Great place. Close to subway.,1
Parking was a big issue. lights not working in the room| tv didn't work. request for more towel| we got the towels| toilet paper after requested to speak with manager. :(,0
Property Staff was very professional| greeted us at the desk.,1
Was a great place to stay the view is amazing. Very close to things to do and subway station.,1
Great place!  However| could use a touch of upgrades as the room had obvious signs of wear-and-tear.,1
I did not like anything about the place but the location. Room smells like weed. No real heat. No microwave or refrigerator. Old and outdated. No accommodations for no restaurant due to Covid. Most hotels. No spoon no forks no bag warmers. No tooth paste and much more. It was all bad including the beds. 750$ for 2/half days. I was better off booking a extended stay. They put up pictures as if the restaurant and rooftop was open &much more when we get there they had No| No|and more no.,0
This hotel should have been great...but it wasn't.  There was no air conditioning.  Also| usually hotels have USB charging ports in their rooms.  I have no idea why a hotel in the middle of NYC wouldn't!  There wasn't even complimentary coffee.  It really felt like this hotel wasn't even fully open.  Very disappointing. Not even vending machines?!,0
Great staff,1
I had two rooms and one of the rooms had a foul odor coming from the fridge and the roomPhone didn't work ! & when I called the front desk the gentleman who answered gonna respond with would u like to to change your room before I could answer ‚Äú oh it's too late ‚Äú was his comeback! Then they sent someone up stairs to spray bug spray which made the room smell even worst !!!!! Never again,0
The hotel is ok it's clean the rooms just need some updating but it's not bad  the bed was comfortable I had a great time  I love the area  Covid  cause a lot of restrictions  but  everything else was ok| the front desk staff was very pleasant and helpful...,1
The staff was courteousness but the amenities were no bueno,0
Disappointed with Expedia customer srervice would like refund horrible experience,0
The parking garage was closed for renovations. AC wasn't enabled - room was hot and could not be cooled. Phone was inoperable. TV was static and difficult to see. Had the run the fan on all not and did not get good sleep.  Bathroom was dirty.  No trash bags in the trash cans. Front desk was polite but was not helpful.,0
The best part of it was the tourist attraction the One world trade center the least I liked about it I booked the junior suite when I arrived in my room the carpet was disgusting the tables were not clean and the room had a nasty odor I called the front desk immediately and they gave me another sweet not an upgrade but a regular sweet like the one I had already booked after traveling 6 hours hours way too tired since we arrived late at night this room was also disgusting so I just bought stuff to clean it..I open a section that supposed to be a refrigerator I think and it was disgusting and it let out the worst odor in the room that I've ever smelled the tables had clearly dust that show through the glass and the window seals was scratched up shower area was not clean the next day a housekeeper came around and said do you need towels they never asked for the room to be cleaned so the day after I called down for housekeeping scheduled it for 10:15 I leave the room for 3 hours just to come back and the room was still dirty call down and let front desk know that housekeeping never came they made up 100 excuses why did the housekeeper came and said it was front desk and housekeeping fault they never told her to clean it being that this is a main attraction to this city this was the worst experience I've ever had my first time in New York City then they recommended the little man parking where the guys wore a new pair of my shoes and placed them back in the car the next day,0
The room was good| but they had refrigerator that didn't work. They claimed because of Covid. Tv doesn't have a lot of options. I had a nice view though.,1
When I arrived in my room I realized that the window was open all the way. I informed the concierge and he placed me in another room because the window was broke. What I didn't like about my stay was the workout room. It was closed the whole weekend. They placed a ‚ÄúClosed for the weekend‚Äù sign on the door. I feel like that should be something they inform people about before they book. I missed out on 2 days of working out because I thought the hotel had a functioning gym. Also| no ice on my 25th floor room. Another sign posted said ‚Äú30th floor for ice. I expected more from a Hilton; a Hilton in Manhattan! The only great part about my stay was the concierge he helped a lot. Recommended a bus tour and even gave me another mask when I left mines upstairs. Disappointed!,0
beautiful building. view from our small suite was breathtaking. it definitely delivered.,1
Very luxurious and classy I will most definitely stay here on my next business trip to New York,1
The rooms were dirty with stains on the carpet and furniture.,0
The hotel was BEAUTIFUL. I'll always stay there when I visit New York. The only thing missing was a fridge. A lot of food went to waste because I had no place for it. I used the A/C vent to keep some things at least cool and a bucket of ice for some ice cream. The bed was cozy and the view was spectacular.,1
The place was clean and well kept| one problem we had was that the AC was kept at 78 degrees by default so sleeping underneath the semi comfortable covers without sweating was impossible. When we called to have it lowered| the front desk said they were sending somebody up to fix it but to no avail nobody came.,0
The hotel is not a 4 stars hotel. The furniture in the room was just broken| the TV was from the 90s| the carpet was dirty| no fridge or minibar in the room| etc.,0
It was beautiful hotel . Nice staff and friendly. Neighborhood was decent lots of options for food . Beautiful view and very clean .,1
Wonderful place to stay but wish they were more specific on no parking because it was under construction an no microwave no mini bar but the view was beautiful,1
Not updated| bathroom sink was broken| the concierge was accommodating and helpful but they do need to update the rooms,0
The check in was very unorganized. Our room and hallways smelled like marijuana the whole stay and no one from the organization offered us a new room. They never gave us new towels the whole stay and they never answered the phone. Very unprofessional and bad customer service.,0
Unprofessional staff with luck of communication,0
The staff is very rude there was big party going on cops were called People roaming around the hotel,0
Horrible hotel...........!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
The hotel is so outdated lot of the plugs didn't work lot of  lights didn't work and there's no fridge but an amazing view,0
It's a great property. Room is elegant & efficient. Staff is accommodating. But the location provides breathtaking views that are unique and beyond comparison.,1
The view is amazing| and the hotel is close to all of downtown| but the rooms need upgrading| and the property and rooms were not as clean as they should be--especially not in the age of COVID 19. The office chair in my room had stains on it| there were fingerprints under the glass part of the table| and fingerprints and a decent amount of dust on the windowsills. Fortunately I travel with disinfecting wipes and spray| so I squared things away. There were maskless guests in the lobby| and discarded masks in an elevator. We stayed here 2 years ago| and it's disappointing to see how much the property has declined. The staff| however| are still first rate.,1
Excellent view of lower Manhattan. Good price and off site parking,1
This hotel is in SERIOUS need of investment and upgrade.  The room was dated| the bed was really uncomfortable| and there was little to no staff on site to assist with problems| which in my case were many.  The 25th floor stank of marijuana in the common areas| and it even wafted under the bedroom door and woke me up.  It was so intense. The check-in process was a total disaster - hoards of people and a single agent at the desk.  She was helpful and polite - no doubt - but the expectation that one person can check in a hundred people is ridiculous.Would not recommend this hotel.,0
Nice hotel.  A bit dated but the view was great and the location convenient.,1
"Being in the heart of the City and observing microaggression's isn't an unusual combination. Now I understand that all hotels have policy's and regulations they have to follow| however you can't pick and choose who regulations and policy's apply to. When entering the hotel the lady had made it clear to me that ""no smoking in rooms was permitted""",0
We stayed 3 nights/2 days. The men in charge of receiving guests wasn't friendly it all. He didn't explain about the extra fees or the health screening we supposed to fill. When we or other people asked about it he was very rude. Besides that| the first day we received the cleaning service but not the second day. We asked for it| they said they will work on that before that end of the day but it never happened.,1
It was pretty good the only thing people was making noises and smoking even in areas that they shouldn't... but that's under every personal behavior doesn't go really under the hotel but the rest was pretty good under the limits we still live in now a days,1
The view of the 40th floor was nice i was able to see the world trade center and more .,1
This is the most disgusting ‚Äúmotel‚Äù I've ever been to. The rooms are outdated and the upkeep is deplorable. There were stains and remnants of past guests everywhere.,0
I love everything about the facility and the cleanliness of this hotel and views are amazing.,1
I loved the view from my room| but not the fact that had i used the wifi while in my room i would've had to pay for it. I've stayed in p!enty of hotels and I've never paid to use wifi..,1
View of the Freedom Tower from the 30th floor was incredible,1
Good overall. I have no complaints for my stay. It was one night only.,1
Accessible  to public transportation. Friendly staff,1
I loved this hotel. It's really beautiful| clean and safe. Thanks,1
The view was amazing! Staff was friendly. Some repairs were needed to the room| including the thermostat.,1
What is unique and good about the property it's the location but the rooms suck| beautiful view of the city downtown the more your up but such an ugly room and not so clean,0
Great hotel. Very clean . The view is delightful| right across from One World Trade Center and 911 memorial. Also short walk to Brooklyn bridge | Statue of Liberty| New York Stock Exchange,1
The view from the room was fantastic! The hotel is conveniently located across the Oculus with easy access to train and buses to explore the city.,1
The views and the convenience of the subway stations were the best things about the hotel. There was also plenty of space in thr junior suite. We disliked was the dated decor| electric sockets in tye room that wouldn't firmly hold a plug| and no fridge or microwave.,1
LOOOOOVED MY VIEW. So perfect for my birthday. BOOK THE JUNIOR SUITE! 4211 is where i stayed & it was beauuuuuutiful. I loved it so much. My room wasnt that deeply cleaned prior to me stay tho.,1
My room was very underrated. The water was uncomfortably hot| the beds were small and unstable. The beds made noise as soon as we laid down and wobbled. The iron push button was broken. The room just wasn't up to par!,0
I love this hotel very nice and clean.Food is good service is excellent!,1
Hotel was clean and privacy was maintained. Check in was okay and staff minds their business.,1
Great staff| clean rooms| beautiful view,1
I love the view  and the cleanliness the hotel have,1
Hotel was not as clean as reviews made it seem. Super thin walls let you hear absolute everything and no amenities AT ALL bc of COVID. did not find out until check in bc it is not disclosure in their website!,0
well honestly I don't like we don't have anything included| no breakfast area nothing and the most worst the parking omg is so cold and we need to walk from the parking outside to the hotel,1
Great views. Cleanliness was ok. Concierge could have been a little friendlier during check in process. But overall it was a great stay,1
First room smelled like marijuana. Area around the elevators also smelled like marijuana. Hotel moved us. Second room had moldy shower walls (in the grout line). Asked maid to clean the mold. Returned to room and bathroom wall was still moldy. I don't know if this was just an isolated incident or norm at this hotel| but it's not acceptable at a Hilton.,0
Didn't like that the fridges were not available for the rooms. Our room had no towels when we came in and had to order them to receive them. Barely any toilet paper.,0
Very attractive location right across the street from One World Trade Center (aka The Freedom Tower). You can tell this hotel was once very sophisticated and brought in all types of people. Unfortunately| it isn't maintained great anymore and you have a lot of sketchy people staying there. The weekend I was there there was a party in the next room until 2:00am and you could definitely smell weed. Not a terrible experience but it could surely use some upgrades.,1
The room smelled horrible because there was old food in the refrigerator.  The coffee maker still had coffee in it.  The whole experience was bad.,0
This place is bad. Not clean and also the service was terrible. The elevators took forever and people were not six feet apart,0
We were not aware that this hotel  had NO PARKING AND WE HAD TO OAY $160 for parking that was crazy. Very unhappy. So much dust in the hotel rooms. Dust on the lamps. Not clean,0
The hotel room view is amazing...but they had no refrigerator| no microwave| the heat wasnt working in one part of the room and they expect you to place the trash bags in the bins.,1
Not as nice as listed . Claimed to have black out curtains but they where to short for that windows . Listed a bunch of amenities with the room | have where not there .,0
I enjoyed the view it was a great stay.,1
Place is beautiful but the staff wasn't friendly or looked like they wanted to be there. The phone system didn't work and we had to walk down to the elevator and go to the lobby to ask questions. We bought a bottle of wine but couldn't open it cause the didn't have a corkscrew. Ask the front desk they answered with we are out or check your room,1
It was a nice view and social distancing was well implemented.,1
Nice place to stay. The room was clean and the view was nice. I would definitely stay at this Hotel again.,1
Nice hotel | nice view and excellent service.......... thank you,1
Very clean and friendly staff. Highly recommend. I will be returning soon.,1
The hotel feels dilapidated and very outdated. The shower in our junior suite did not have a hand-held attachment| there was constant loud banging noise coming from outside the windows. We have booked a two weeks stay but had to check out after one night and move to a different hotel.,0
Everything was great thank you for the experience see you again one day,1
The view was beautiful. Only downfall i was told the day before my check in that it was $50 per night for accidental fee which would b refunded. Total $150 since i stayed 3 nights. I got there and was then told it was $75 per which came up to $225 smh. No food no pool no gym and the fridge in the room was broken. It was a quiet stay but dey need to really do better.,0
property was decent and the location is excellent but it was very crowded and there was almost always a line for the elevator. the heat in the room didn't work and we booked and paid for a king bed and got a queen. the view was decent though.,0
It was fine!,1
I expected a bit more for being a Hilton hotel| but I felt comfortable| and the view was spectacular,1
Nice neighborhood tbh . It was pretty cool experience for it being my time . Would go again. My only complaint it's that I wish they gave me a higher room to see the veiw.,1
Definitely had good time and enjoyed the view. The layout and d√©cor seems like it can use a bit of an upgrade| but it still gets an 8.5 out of 10 from me. I was happy with my stay!,1
My Sunday last Sunday was not what I was expecting from a Hilton hotel. Carpet floor was smelly and outdated.  Heating system was malfunctioning and operating it was a hassle . It's a shame to have a Hilton chaine with such old air control system.Sheets were stained and had hair . Hallways had a terrible odor and TV signal was mediocre . Overall my  experience was horrible that I ended up leaving and staying over with family . I'm asking you respectfully to refund me as I'm not planning on staying at this hotel again !!,0
The guy at the front desk and the manager argues with a lot of people in front of me and with me. I don't think they should work there at all.,0
The TV in the living room didnt work| we called the front desk| they said someine will come uo to our room| no one evwr showed up....,1
Most of the extra stuff is off limits which I get due to covid . But that just means your staffing needs to be 120% more on there game. No one smiles . No one welcomes you. And upon my leaving your front desk told me a lie just to get me out. You need to teach everyone about customers service !,1
The room was big| needed alittle updating. The view was amazing & service was good,1
This hotel is so centric in downtown Manhattan. View of One world trade center was amazing. Spacious bedroom (king size bed). No housekeeping during pandemic but you can ask for towels in the front desk and throw away your trash and you're good. Toilet and TV are out dated but we just came to sleep after being in the city all day. Friendly staff. Everything excellent. Would come back.,1
The view was an amazing view. Definitely sparked my feelings to come back.,1
The one thing I did not like is that you have to pay for fridge or raider and microwave above above all the experience was really nice the room was clean and nice customer service very friendly,1
This was a great getaway for a Jersey family. We loved everything about the area and the view was breathtaking! Will deff be back,1
Staff was friendly and patient| loved the cleanliness and design,1
Room was dirty | wasn't there for even 30mins when I checked out but they charged me for the whole night,0
Location and Staff. BEAUTIFUL HOTEL. Cleanliness .,1
Great views. Great location| convenient to shopping.,1
Excellent view and comfortable rooms and bathrooms,1
Most of hotel facilities closed due to Covid.Location was the best of tge best.,1
The pillowcase was dirty as well as the blankets had visible dirt as if they weren't fresh linen. The remote control didn't work either but overall it was ok,1
Your basically paying for the view. It's an older hotel. The window view is amazing. But there isn't a fridge or even a microwave. Basic lights. Last hotel was half cheaper and it was really nice. Just didn't have a view of the city. Was expecting a little more for the price.,1
The view of the wtc memorial was out of this world. Absolutely stunning,1
The fridge was not working the thermostat was acting up and we were very cold the price for the deposit was very high per night per room. Pool was closed. Price was high for not including food and parking spot,0
The entire staff was extremely rude and acted as though my being there was an inconvenience to them. All the amenities were closed| which I knew before I booked| however the staff told me an in-room microwave could be requested. When requested| they told me none were available and could not give me an ETA on when to expect one. The bathtub drain was clogged so every time I showered there was sitting water. As the staff was so rude I did not feel comfortable reporting the problem and asking to change rooms. The location and view itself were amazing| and the bed was comfortable however I would never stay here again due to the attitude of the entire staff.,0
Great hotel right infront from 9/11 Beautiful view super close to Brooklyn bridge. Nice stay at Downtown and close to stores & restaurants.,1
The Millennium Hilton New York Downtown was unique in terms of it's location. Being by the WTC and all the local transit stations made it a prime real-estate for anyone visiting.  I was able to get around the city easily. In terms of my actual hotel experience it was subpar. The hotel staff and hotel services you could tell was downsized which was most likely due to covid. I think this negatively affect my stay a little. My friends hotel room wasn't properly prepared| the bathroom wasn't cleaned properly. The ice machine on the various floors weren't functional. I had to travel to the 50th floor to get ice every time. Other than does little instances. The stay was average| I appreciate that I got a nice view from my room. I was very pleased with that. I think I can't complain my stay was decent.,1
I loved the location. The bed was a little hard and uncomfortable. The bathroom could of been a little nicer.,1
I didn't like the fact that COVID is going on and my sheets had dried blood and hair. I would think the sheets would be changed before you are going to issue a room to a person with COVID spreading like wild fires but that was not the case.,0
Customer services was bad he wasn't nice,1
Everything was excellent I like the way I was receiving emails and updates accordingly.,1
My stay was great| me and my boyfriend stayed in a junior suite and the view was amazing and the room was very comfortable. Check in was decent but some of the morning staff didn't acknowledge us walking in or out of the lobby but over all I was satisfied and will now make this hotel my weekend getaway spot so I'll be going back very soon.,1
Location| location| location. Spectacular views from my room. Only set back. No refrigerator and no microwave. Not even a vending machine.,1
The hotel is very nice. I had a city view room on the 54th floor. The view was like a movie. Room is spacious for NYC| comfortable| and nice to be in. Close to almost every train. Parking is an issue as is with most places in the city. We enjoyed our stay.,1
my room had a beautiful view the place where the hotel is located is spectacular,1
Breathtaking view! We loved it!,1
Great hotel| quiet| clean|| The Tv was old school| couldn't put what I wanted on it because of that|| but if you are not there to watch tv||it's  an awesome hotel| really really great location for the price| I have no complaints.,1
Beautiful hotel. Amazing views! Would definitely stay there again!,1
Okay| so I decided to have a little staycation in the city for the weekend with my little ones. Upon arrival| the hotel is very polished looking| would definitely appeal to business clients/visitors. Front desk staff| was welcoming| quick and efficient. No complaints there. I was placed on the 32nd floor| and my room was close to the elevator. This is where things started to go left for me. 1. This is a non smoking facility| but the elevator and room area REEKED of smoke. And not like oh someone is smoking in their room| more like this is the SMOKING FLOOR. 2. Room| albeit clean is a bit dated. The floors were carpeted| so naturally there were a couple stains. My 5 year old naturally cops a squat on the floor as a kid| and I'm like ehh ehh| don't sit don't sit! 3. No fridge... 4. Bathroom| again clean| but dated. And I noticed there was a leak from the pipe when you turn on the cold water. I remember washing my sons face and I'm like how the hell did the floor get so wet?5. There's no room service until 3 days into your stay in regards to Covid restrictions. Now I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed| but wouldn't the pandemic ramp UP the cleaning??? I digress. 6. I must have been placed on the ‚Äúpopping‚Äù floor because there was quite a bit of traffic at night. Not the WORST| but I'm having a staycation| so I wanted to chill.7. I had to print a document for work| so I went to the business center| where there were 3 computer stations. 1 pc and 2 Macs| TBC,0
There's no control on the facility| staff horrible customer service from some of them not all of them and not happy with my room at all,0
Is hotel. But have many restrictions by pandemic COVID 19,0
Couches in rooms was filthy| you could see the dirt on them. Carpets was filthy as well| service at check in was terrible| front desk service was terrible!,0
The staff was amazing.  The location is amazing.  Our room had a view of St. Paul's| where George Washington prayed. The oculus and the 9/11 memorial are right outside the hotel.  Thank you so much for a remarkable trip.,1
My room wasn't cleaned the whole time i was there. I had to clean myself and had a big trash bag just sitting in my room for days.,0
The experience was great! The room did have a couple of flaws like water mark stains on the curtains and if it's sunny you can see alot of dust on the outside windows but other than that it was great,1
My stay was amazing...the staff took great care of me. I work in the medical field and needed the TLC which they provided.,1
My stay was ok. The only problem was the shower wasn't clean and the,1
Honestly everything was great. Very clean| beautiful view| and great location. Only thing I would suggest is the hotel investing in more comfortable pillows.,1
This was a horrible experience. There was not a refrigerator in the room or a microwave. There was no valet parking. Staff was not friendly and not accommodating. The room was freezing.,0
Was beautiful only complaint that there is no fridge in the room so strange,1
It's was my birthday. My husband and spent one night here the location was Kusic with a perfect New York city view of Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan Bridge..Our restaurant was walking distance from this location so that was a plus for me. The room was just what we needed for the night clean spacious and comfortable. The shower was a little bit tricky a little bit too modern  The flooring were flat so The entire bathroom was wet.,1
Good location and property| but furniture felt a bit old and dingy.,1
Beautiful room| with a gorgeous city view like we requested.,1
I absolutely love this hotel.  I spend one night a week in NYC and the Millennium is my preferred hotel| hands down!,1
I had to switch my room 3 times due to the room being dirty specifically the bathroom. The rooms weren't updated and the curtains and chair cushion were stained. Never staying there again. On Expedia it stated there was valet but there actually wasn't and we had to find street parking in the middle of midtown,0
My second stay at the hotel. Always nice check in service and great Help n with concierge. We love it.,1
The view is amazing| and staff members are very friendly.,1
great all aroundconveniant to 9/11 memorialbeautiful room,1
I was very disappointed The room was extremely cold the window was left open and I could not close maintenance came they close the window but there still was no heat the carpet was dirty the room was antiquated old there was a garbage bag with a dirty face mass stuck in the smoke detector the staff was nice but I couldn't understand why I didn't have any heat could not stay there change hotels,0
Its my second time in this hotel i love the view but the manager when i was checking in wasnt that nice and the housekeeping policy is silly for 6 nights 1 time cleaning!!,1
Simply the best. Fell in love with NYC all over again.,1
Well first if I had a Junior suite I should've had a Refrigerator Microwave And two bathrooms in my suite  because on the website that's what it says for a Junior suite... I found used condoms in my suite and the sheets and blanket had stains on it,1
It was directly across from WTC. So location was nice. The front desk staff are somewhat unfriendly and show a lack of professional courtesy. But even that doesn't bother me to much. The bathtub kept backing up| but was eventually fixed. But what I found disgusting were sample shampoo and body lotions had tiny black hairs all on the inside cap. For some reason that made me gag to think they aren't replaced after each guest.,0
Fantastic location. Right across the street from transportation hub and mall (The Oculus). One street over from the 9/11 memorial. Plenty of things to do and places to eat. Lots to see. The view is amazing. Unfortunately| due to COVID| amenities were closed at the hotel including the parking garage but we were lucky enough to find a garage one street over for the same price we would have paid to park at the hotel. Property was very clean. WILL DEFINITELY BOOK AGAIN.,1
For the chain this hotel is apart of and the location,0
Room was not ready even though we arrived at regular checkin time.,0
Dirty old room. Nice view. Needs A major overhaul.,0
solid bed| Amazing view of park Row and in the distance over the buildings| Manhattan Bridge. ask tor a room facing east| unless you want to look at the world trade center and get in your feelings. This is an older hotel| there is a Power strip for your chargeables because when the Millenium was new| people only had rotary phones and so only one outlet in the room. still a great time and space for the $$$,1
It was okay. None much to really do,0
I didn't really like the toilet| it was to low For a normal person to sit very uncomfortable and very hard to get up or down . I would say it could be unsafe as well .,1
Horrible hotel!!! Disrespectful staff!!! Do not ever stay at the hotel!,0
The lobby was presented well.  The room was disappointingly worn.  A/C rattled all night and I was unable to sleep.,0
Jr Suite was spacious with great view of Freedom Tower and WTC. Security staff at lobby were the most obnoxious and disrespectful| Wouldn't even allow folks to sit at the lobby or take a phone call. Lady at business center was very nice.,0
Beautiful property and very well located. Our room had an amazing view and I cant wait to go back!,1
The staff was very rude| the room was very dusty| the walls are not soundproofed at all and the guests next-door were very load to late hours of the night.Was a horrible experience and definitely don't recommend this hotel.,0
Great customer service and a beautiful view. The King Suite room could use an update honestly for the price you pay. The room seems outdated and bland. But overall was a great experience. I would recommend staying there.,1
Due to COVID-19 there were no amenities and the parking garage was closed. It would have been very helpful to have known ahead of time about the parking garage. That may have been a determining factor in choosing the hotel. We had to walk several blocks with luggage to the alternate garage| and my husband has a leg injury. On a positive note - the hotel was clean and the location is great.,1
The concierge was extra helpful and polite. The best service.  The cleaning lady was cheerful and super nice.,1
Do not stay here. Staff are extremely rude| they won't hold your luggage past four and they won't allow you to use the restroom downstairs.,0
The hotel is beautiful and the price was great for a nice couples night out BUT the water was ice cold in the morning and we weren't able to shower. Mentioned it upon checkout and it didn't seem to phase the person at the front desk. Not even an apology offered for the inconvenience. Customer service is such a thing of the past these days....///,1
We booked for one night but ended up leaving early. The phone in the room wasn't working and the noise level was a bit crazy from the room next door| it was almost as though our neighbors were in the room with us. Beautiful view| we appreciated that but the walls are paper thin...Because we are in NY at least once a month| we will probably stay there again| hopefully next time it's better.,1
Nice staff and room,1
All was fine - check in staff was competent. Room was good|  view of the Oculus and the Freedom Tower were amazing.  Covid had the streets fairly empty and the hotel amenities not in service. Biggest  complaint was the straight out of the 90's TV in room was abysmal with horrible reception. Otherwise all was above average.,1
Our room had amazing views of One World Trade aka The Freedom tower| One of the 9/11 memorial pools and the New Oculus and it was clean a bit small for it to be a king room but it was ok. The only complaint was that there was no hot water 2x out of the 3 days we stayed at the wrong time especially the day of check out when I wanted to shower before I left. The phones in the room were not working cause they wasnt charging correctly we couldnt get ours to work. The ice machines are not turned on| on every floor so you can only get ice from the designated floors in which a sign on the machine will tell you where to go. If you want to bypass the hotel tv I was able to hook up my firestick and watch my shows just paid for the premium wifi for streaming purposes $5.00 a day used it for 2 days. Other than the amenities not being available due to Covid. I would definitely book again. Hopefully the next time the hot water issue would be corrected.  I would also ask for my next room to not be so near the elevators and maybe next views of the Brooklyn and Mahattan bridges.,1
The room that they gave us the lights didn't work also the bathroom door don't close we ask for another room then the room was dirty no wifi the next day they clean up our room and they took one of our shopping bags.,0
Beautiful hotel| room was clean and tidy. Loved everything,1
Great experience| clean and enjoyable!,1
Room had human hair in bathroom Lights wasnt working tv remote wasnt working untill they replaced it Bad experience all over especially for junior suits Wont stay again,0
Our stay was amazing. During check in the first room that was assigned to us the tv was very staticky and very outdated so we decided to go back down and request a new room. The gentleman that accommodated us was very helpful and moved us to a different room with no problems. Overall the hotel was clean| the view was nice and it was a nice little getaway.,1
Everything was fine| only the wifi didn't work. Such a great experience,1
The view was awesome but the room and bathroom were dated no USB ports Bathroom is due for remodel.No other amenities due to Covid,1
When I reserved it said free parking.  When I checked in the hotel said they don't have parking. It is so wrong you guys can't update information on websites. I ended spending so much on parking spot| not cool.,0
It was terrible i kept hearing noises all night and day i ask the hotel manager wat was it and they said people were working on the elevator all lies then the long line to get on the elevator they had no parking u had to park a block away,0
Great views| kind service. Amenities closed for covid.,1
The room was spacious and very comfortable with great location,1
Very disappointed with staff and their customer service. The room was not cleaned on time and when you for the room to be clean no one available. There is some days that room does not get clean at all until the next day. I did make a request for a microwave from my second day and never received one at all till checked out.,0
It's a nice hotel in a very good location| due to COVID 19 there was almost no service at the hotel| the pool was closed and so was the gym| but it's understandable. The room was big and the view was amazing| very comfortable bed and big screen tv with lots of channels. The furniture is a little dated and there are stains on the carpet.The mini bar wasn't working and I was told that it was disconnected because of the pandemic| but since I stayed for a week they brought me a little fridge and it was very helpful. Overall I was pleased and the view was breathtaking| the freedom tower right outside the window.,1
Great facility with an amazing view over the Oculus and the skyscrapers of World Trade Center. Very clean.,1
great hotel in an incredible location!  Multiple subway stops with in a block and the PATH trains stop right out front. Only complaint is that the walls are a little thin and so there is some noise. Nothing terrible. And I will stay here again but it was there. Management was good about talking to particularly noisy rooms. Which I appreciated.,1
Chargingn me 250. For already damaged room,0
the room was not very clean.  The fridge was broken| the TV control too.  various dirty places.  In 6 days there was not a single house keeping.  According to Hilton| due to covid policies| you must request it yourself in advance| even if you spend a month in the Hotel and even if the garbage leaves the door. In this particular hotel the only thing you have access to is your room| all other areas of it were closed by Covid.,0
Wasn't sure if the room was ever cleaned from the previous guest stay. There was a used towel on the bathroom sink counter and there were used water bottles in the refrigerator. The refrigerator was plugged in but was not cold at all.,1
Upon arriving to our FIRST room| we walked in to a cracked tv screen and old bed linen sitting on the chair. It didn't look as if the room was cleared or checked before being assigned to us. Although the room was quickly swapped out for us and the tv in our second room wasn't cracked| we still weren't impressed. The fridge in the second room was not on and all shelving from the fridge was stored in the top drawer of the dresser. There was also still left over hair on the floor from the prior guests or whoever ‚Äúcleaned‚Äù the room before we checked in. In addition| the garbage on our floor was overflowing when we checked in and was not taken out until we checked out... 2 days later. Overall| didn't reach standards of cleanliness and we won't be back.,0
Very clean | spacious and friendly check in...,1
I loved the view from the 52nd floor and corner room.,0
Had some issues with check in| front desk was not willing to help| besides that had a good experience in overall.,1
The views are spectacular. Room is nicely appointed and the king size bed is a real luxury in nyc.,1
GREAT!!! AMAZING AND A GREAT PLACE TO STAY AND GREAT LOCATION,1
Check in was a breeze and staff is friendly. View is beautiful from the 46th floor. However the room had a strange smell went to the store and purchased air freshener to fix it.,1
The room was horrible and it smelled horrible. There was no service and the fridge was broken.,0
The city view of the World Trade Center from my room,1
I checked in the room and the room wasn't clean at all and I opened the Mini fridge it had old food that was smiling really bad and old stuff from last one was in the room and that's Disgusting!!!!!!!,0
Very disappointing ..... with the biggest issue being lack of basic requirement of people wearing masks.  No one to monitor that situation| that I saw.  Concierge desk was usually unattended.  ???   Did not feel safe ....Will not go back .... should complain to Hilton,0
It was wonderful. Staff are very friendly especially a lady who helped me check in process. That was fast and kind. The room  was spacious and clean. Grate place !,1
Super good! I love the view| my room and the place.,1
Overall the stay was good. However| there no parking which is crazy for a hotel not to have parking. A guest must of complain about noise at 10:15pm while we were getting ready to go out on a Saturday night. The staff came up to issue a warning and if they came back again we could be evicted smh. This really blow our minds... we didn't want to ruin the night so we left has we were doing so anyways. Other than that the rooms are nice and the view is great!,1
The only complaint is that the room has no microwave or fridge| and you have to go to another floor to get ice. The staff wasnt so friendly. Great location and stunning view |,1
It was great| the location was perfect and I really enjoyed myself!,1
second stay and I will likely stay a third soon. I wish things like the bar was open but other than that| it was a nice stay.,1
Didnt have a refrigerator or microwave for my stuff and it went bad the place where the refrigerator was rusty and dusty i spoke to the front desk and they said it was a chillier not a refrigerator but i wouldn't put anything in there wasn't sanitary at all i requested a room change but i was denied. Never again,0
The check in process was quick | we got a high floor (amazing views!). I'd definitely come back.,1
I was really disappointed with my stay here. Due to COVID I expected the rooms to be extra clean but that was not the case. There was old food left in our mini fridge from the previous guests. Online it states that the rooms are left empty 72 hours between guests so this food was sitting in the mini fridge for over 3 days and smelled so bad. Our bathroom floor was also extremely dirty and there were urine stains around the toilet. We called the front desk to inform them and we were placed on a long hold and then they told us the the only thing they could do was to have someone come and remove the old food but no one was available to clean it. No one came to remove the food that night. It wasn't until the next day when we put the sign on our door for house keeping that house keeping came and removed the food but didn't clean the fridge or anything else in the room and we had to request new towels because we weren't given any. Also I had booked a deluxe room but there was nothing deluxe about it. It was extremely small and it wasn't worth the extra money for the deluxe. I have stayed at the other Millenium Hilton properties and this one was a huge disappointment.,0
I didn't see any statement regarding pool being closed| it wasn't until we were at the property we were told all amenities were closed.  I stayed elsewhere in NYC 2 weeks ago and their bar/restaurant was open.  Also at checkin the representative was not very friendly almost going through the motions.  The room had nice views of the city and location was great.,1
Friendly staff and cozy room. Amazing city view plenty of stuff to doPizza shop amazing great historical site Word trade center memorial,1
It took a very long time to check in .. long lines .. at the front desk  ..fridge in the room was not working and broken .. others guest arguing in the hallway early mornings,0
Our room stunk very strongly like marijuana. Staff was very helpful with trying to get rid of the smell. But would have preferred a new room. Hotel was full booked apparently. Had great experiences during past stays| this one was very disappointing. Probably our last stay sadly since we love the location.,0
Great stay very clean the only inconvenient part was no parking at all,1
I loved the view in my hotel room and the television quality was great! HBO movies available! The bad side of this hotel is - the water was brownish when I first turned it on| there was bugs crawling on the wall| the AC and refrigerator does not work. Also there is no microwave that I was able to use.,0
Nice place| all amenities were unavailable due to COVID-19. Room view was amazing,1
No sense staying here. No parking at all| nothing but,0
Very disappointed in this hotel | my watch was stolen and the hotel have not yet did anything about it . The junior suite was a disappointment . Room needed to be updated and renewed .. i complained numerous of times and no one did anything . Never should've came here on my birthday . Only thing i like was the view .,0
No parking at the hotel|all parking around is $70 dollars per night|and the staff including the manager is rude.,0
Nice n clean. Fast check in. Nice staff. Next to stores n restaurants,1
Awful.  I'll never stay here again.  My room had black mold in the bathroom and my sheets were not clean.  The service at the front desk was terrible.  I understand Covid has everything screwed up but yikes this wasn't worth it at all.,0
But stinky room| carpet was dirty and very looks really old,0
Fantastic location and hotel in general. At this time the hotel has to suspend a lot of there normal services| Restaurant| Bar| Room Service| ETC. Regardless| what an awesome stay!,1
The city view on the room it was beautiful and convenient,1
Furniture outdated and wornVents in bathroom so filthy Bed sheet had holes in itCarpet multiple stains Gross not what it use to be,0
I have been going to this hotel since 2013; granted| I have not been since late 2016| but this weekend in 2020 was awful: the room was grimy| moldy in the bathroom| paint chipped and peeling| wall paper with paint marks all over it| the chairs looked soiled| the room smelled of smoke| kids running around and banging things at 10:30pm--horrible experience.,0
Great location however| everything in the area is still shut down.,1
Everything was great except the mini bar is cancelled and there are no amenities but still a resort fee. But their security fee is only $50 considering everything. Staff and room was amazing and if you can| make reservations for ‚ÄúThe Cut‚Äù| the food was amazing,1
Upon arriving the concierge energy was very degrading and rude. Then after waiting two to three hours after checkin because our room was not ready In time. They then put us in the disgusting room. I was then referred to a manager after complaining and I was compensated,0
I stayed at a junior suite overlooking the west side| the 36th floor view was amazing| very comfortable and a nice place to stay.,1
I wanted to enjoy the pool but it was closed,1
Beautiful location| quick check in and very clean! Will definitely be back to stay!,1
The hotel was amazing me and my husband stayed in a Junior suite the view was amazing and the customer service was great.. I definitely recommend this hotel!! Will Stay again!!,1
Clean and fast check in. Service was great.  Great location as well. Street parking only.,1
Fantastic views. However| currently no room service. The room we were checked into had a running toilet that would not stop. Management promptly moved us to another room.,1
had the best experience from check in all the way through check out! views were amazing. and so close to all my fav little spots in TriBeCa. will definitely stay here often.,1
Very comfortable. Very safe. Very quiet. We will definitely stay again,1
Due to covid 19  the pool and resturant was closed,1
The hotel was good| great views| rooms are a bit dated and need a refresh,1
I always wanted to stay in this hotel given its excellent location and awesome views. Unfortunately the property is run down. My room was not very clean| AC did not work| the elevators were dirty. Very disappointing. I'm not planning to stay there again.,0
The view from our room was nothing short of amazing. It was small| and the bed was definitely not a King| it was a really uncomfortable mattress as well. Had many issues with the tv shutting off by itself|  the guide didn't work either.  Ice machine on our floor didnt work which was a issue for me especially being on the 50th floor.,1
A very nice hotel with a great view!  The staff very accommodating.,1
the view was amazing.the place was clean and smelled great.,1
Stayed during covid... hotel was very clean and staff was helpful and kind.Slept well- quiet room| beautiful views!!!,1
The view is amazing | I extended my stay because this was by far the best experience ever,1
I was in the 43rd floor and the view of 1 world trade| the entire downtown and NJ was amazing!!!,1
Everyone was very pleasant and professionals. Will recommend this hotel to my friends,1
I didn't like that the mini fridge in my room wasn't working. When reported nothing was done,1
We really enjoyed our stay and the location was great,1
Very nice hotel in a really good area!! It's just a bit outdated.,1
Staff was more than helpful .  Hair dryer would not work and they were up with a new one in no time,1
Great stay| nice view| great staff| highly recommend.,1
Family trip. Hotel was clean. Staff was not overly friendly. Compared to our other stays in NYC. We enjoyed the pool. Location to transportation and shopping was great. Wish they would of had USB ports for charging electronics in the room. Beds were not as described. It was an OK stay.,0
The view was amazing. The bed was comfortable and the soap they provide smelled awesome. The room was nice| but was not cleaned extremely thoroughly. I found a bottle cap on the floor near the bed| in the corner of the room near the dresser there was a dirty cotton ball and an old french fry (ew)| and the snacks were not replenished before I checked in... there was only a can of Pringles and a granola bar left. The TV quality was very poor for a Hilton hotel and the room smelled like cigarettes.,1
Great Stay no issues at all,1
Loved the views... The easy access to main attraction. Exemplary customer service.,1
It was awesome| everyone was helpful. Will do it again.,1
It was an amazing experience! The staff was friendly| the room was superb and the view was incredible! We were on the 53rd floor.,1
Too expensive. For that price should have had free breakfast at least.,1
Luxury hotel in great location and beautiful view.,1
The Millennium Hotel is perfectly located for exploring New York on foot or by the nearby Metro. Our room| which overlooked the Oculus and 9/11 Memorial|  was spotlessly clean and had fabulous views of the city.,1
Great location| very clean rooms and attentive staff. The only suggestions would be more comfortable pillows| usable mini fridge and usb outlets.,1
Location is greatStaff very helpful.Some upgrade of carpets would be an improvement.,1
"The location is of course| fantastic. However| we were disappointed by the room. It was in dire need of an upgrade; the carpet was dirty and stained| the curtains were also dirty and stained| and there was not refrigerator. The small refrigerator that was in the room was packed full of stuff to purchase and the refrigerator was not even cold. The pool was very small and there was no spa (Jacuzzi). Perhaps worst of all| there were only two full beds in the room that were barely suited to one person| and definitely not two adults. The mattresses were terrible! I could feel the springs. We would have liked to have ordered room service the evening we arrived because we were exhausted from travelling but they wanted $24 for one burger. I understand that room service is usually expensive but $24 for a burger? Also| the final bill included charges for three snacks/drinks that they claimed we took from the ""refrigerator"" or ""mini-bar"" (whatever they want to call it) that we had most definitely not taken. They didn't argue with us and they readily deducted the items from our final bill. I definitely would not recommend this hotel to any of my friends.",0
I ain't like how tv didn't have YouTube service was bad and bad connection,0
We planned a short stay in NY for New Years. Even though we drove it was nice to see it was right next to a train station. The staff was nice even though one doorman looked a bit irritated that night. We were upgraded to the junior suite which has the most amazing view of the world trade memorial. The best hotel I've stayed in while visiting NY thus far. Only no complementary breakfast.,1
As always| great to stay here; all the crew super friendly. I will stay again soon.,1
I book a one night stay for a personal ‚Äústaycation‚Äù - with this in mind| I believe| is the reason why the front desk attendant placed me in a handicap accessible room. The view is beautiful but the bed and toilet are considerably low - I'm 5foot 9 so this is a bit uncomfortable. I'd like fair consideration for comfort being a hhonors member and an overall loyal patron. The duration of my stay should not come into consideration when placing a ‚Äúfully callable‚Äù person in a room that is comparable to what was requested at booking.‚Äù,1
I really like the property it was beautiful inside and out. It was a trip for my boyfriend's birthday everything met our expectations and then some. The hotel is kinda pricey but the area we were in made sense.,1
Location was great for us.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  Hotel Lobby and our room were kept clean.Room furniture was worn and dated.All in all we were pleased with our voice of this Hilton property.,1
Very good views and very kind professional staff! The restraint was very well and professional to!,1
The room was great. It was clean very comfortable even the bed was very comfy and the pillows as well...,1
Location superb. Would stay there again without hesitation.,1
We love this hotel.  Our daughter attends college in the financial district| and this hotel is very convenient for visiting her.  The hotel is top notch.  Great staff| nice accommodations| close to many NYC sights.  One of our favorite places.,1
The view was breathtaking| great services and food,1
Everything i liked breakfast and lunch/diner was amazing,1
Nice sized rooms for the price| especially for NYC and the views from the room windows are spectacular.,1
Great phenomenon view of the world trade center| amazing.,1
Solid choice. Hiltons are always a safe bet| early check in was appreciated,1
Beautiful view| right in front of the World Trade Center !!,1
LOVE THE LOCATION OF THIS HOTEL.IN THE MIDDLE OF A LOT IN THE BIG APPLE AND EASY ACCESS TO SUBWAY. ROOMS WITH AWESOME VIEWS OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER AND THE WORK OBSERVATORY  !!! WISH YOU CONSIDER THIS PLACE!,1
What a wonderful hotel in an excellent location!  The views were stunning.  Clean comfortable rooms| friendly helpful staff.  Fabulous stay in the Big Apple!,1
Location was convenient. They originally gave us a room that reeked of smoke| but worked to move us to another room. Suite was comfortable| though the beds were hard foam. Nice to have a pool and convenient to grab breakfast at the hotel restaurant. Seems place is going to need to be updated| but over clean and upkept. Staff was very professional and hospitable. I'd return,1
We had a beautiful room with a perfect view.   The hotel was clean and staff was efficient.   We didn't eat on site but I have no complaints and look forward to returning.  The location is excellent as well.,1
Location excellent. Staff very friendly and helpful.,1
I am very upset with my stay at the Millennium Hilton downtown. The hot water did not work in our room so I had to take a cold shower. Additionally| the TV in the room was outdated and each channel was fuzzy‚Äîunwatchable. I booked the room with the purpose of making it to a law exam early in the morning on time and in the hopes of having a stress-free| good night's sleep. However| I was very frustrated with my experience. The manager sought to alleviate the situation with free breakfast| however| I was still unable to have a relaxing evening in preparation for my exam because I was unable to unwind with a hot shower.,0
Old and tired but great location. Expensive for what it was!!!,0
Did not get the room type I booked. Did not get bed size or bathroom. Box spring on bed not covered and had damage. Not as I expected. Had to be on the phone with Expedia for 1 and a half hours to try and resolve this after long day of work and I was tired. Did not get resolved. Expedia canceled the second night without my  request and I needed to find a room after another long day of work. I was very upset.,0
I am so glad I chose this downtown location as it provided a brilliant starting off point for attractions (2 days with my 13 year old son in NYC). Attractive location| great local restaurants| Citi bikes and sub wait stop on street next door. Pool was a lovely tonic with a bright aspect but rather dated.Breakfast was good expensive.Lovely staff.,1
Hotel was clean| room was spacious and view of one world trade was amazing. My only complaint is that a very loud noise came from the bathroom periodically throughout the night which kept waking me up. Perhaps there are pipe issues that need to be resolved.,1
Fantastic in every way. Well done. Made our time special.,1
Hilton is garbage. I spent $2|000 at this dumpy hotel where I heard people through the walls| and then got Zero points for my stay b/c I booked through Expedia and not directly through Hilton. What made it worse is I was asked at check in if I wanted breakfast or extra points - even though they knew I booked through Expedia!!This hotel is a dump and the service is awful.,0
This was a great property.  I was late coming to the hotel and my king size bedroom was given away.  The manager was very helpful with getting me a better room which suited me.,1
Great location for sight seeing activities.  Shopping just across the street too,1
The staff was great. Location was also very good. The hotel is in need of a renovation. The bathroom shower drain was not working well. The carpet had stains. Was expecting more considering the price we paid for the room.,1
Great location for visiting 9/11 Memorial and Museum.  Excellent bar with very good view.  Close to subway.,1
Perfect location in TriBeCa financial district area. Beautiful views from rooms Looking at ground zero.Rooms need upgrading.,1
Location was great.  Also had great views of city.,1
Fitness center|  size of hotel| clean| everything is great!,1
Very conveniently located hotel in lower Manhattan. Excellent views. Room was clean and comfortable. Rooms are nice| but not updated. No USB ports| but that's a minor inconvenience. Overall would absolutely stay there again.,1
Only passing through NY. Fantastic location and view,1
Amazing Views from 48th Floor room.  Great new demo room of the new modernized renovation to come! Great customer service too!,1
The view from my room was beautiful| overall the experience was very good. I would recommend this hotel.,1
The staff was very nice. The elevators were pretty scary and the hotel was a bit outdated. But the view was amazing definitely my favorite part of the weekend.,1
The location was great for my trip| but there were huge dust bunnies on the tv ‚Äúcabinet|‚Äù housekeeping had to come remove a large bug| my A/C broke| and there was a piece of plastic in my overpriced sandwich. Overall| I was not impressed.,0
Great and iconic hotel right across from the WTC and oculus. We were on just the 12th floor and the views were great! Bed was so comfortable and room was spacious| which was pleasantly surprising to me because most hotel rooms I have stayed in while in NYC were tiny. Drawbacks: pool looks way better in pictures| it was quite small in person and reminded me of 3 star level hotel pools. Also apparently a bartender got nasty with my associate staying in my room but the hotel gave us free breakfast for the rest of the stay as compensation. All in all great stay| I will stay there again.,1
The room was spacious and surface level clean. There was a layer of dust in the TV stand| hard to miss. The carpets in the hallways and elevators are very dated| discolored. The issue I had with my room was noise. I could hear when the rooms either side of mine flushed their toilets. It was very disruptive. Location is great though| I'd say fairly priced due to that point. Great view!,1
First night in 4 nights in NYC that was quiet great locale,1
Great stay| spent my anniversary here it was very nice and we loved the view. Oh and the pool was big plus!,1
Nice hotel| great views and central location. Beware the mini-fridge: it's a you touch it| you buy it deal. Would have been nice to have an empty fridge instead to store a few late night snacks. But! That's nitpicking. Overall| really great stay. Would stay again.,1
View was amazing . Cleanliness to perfection great customer service just everything was great,1
Good location for visiting Manhattan downtown.,1
The hotel building was so beautiful! The view from our hotel room was amazing. Staff was very friendly! We had a few minor issues| such as having to get some of the pillow cases and sheets changed from certain stains. I would suggest the hotel upgrading on their televisions. It was really outdated and not a clear picture. Overall it was a pleasant experience!,1
Great location| great view| very safe.  They need more chairs around the pool and should turn the First Aid Office next to pool into a steam room.  Also open the Lobby bar earlier on weekends.,1
I arrived later the in the evening after getting lost on a hot summer day. I walked in exhausted| and the gentleman in the front desk took noticed. His name was Antonio| and he made sure we enjoyed our one night stay.,1
Great hotel!!! Very well located| and if compared to other I stayed this is a steal. Very inexpensive for the quality!,1
room was filthy...staff was unwelcoming... bottle of water cost 7$ ..free in many hotels...neither bar was open when we arrived nor later in evening... we have stayed there several times in the past we will never stay there again,0
Loved the location-across from several ‚Äòmust sees' in NYC; close to subways if going elsewhereRoom a bit ‚Äòdated' but fantastic views and plenty spacious for NY for two in King bed roomNice staff but was a bit annoyed when we realized we forgot our phone charger not 20 mins after leaving and they claim they didn't have itVery fair price for our last minute trip!!Would return and recommend this property!,1
Best location-DO NOT Rent a car. Parking or valet will destroy you but everything else is great|,1
THAT IS WAS ACROSS FROM THE 9/11 MEMORIAL AND VERY WELL CENTER GOOD LOCATION,1
Very nice hotel| we had a wonderful view. Very close to subway station for easy commute to mid-town. Pool was very relaxing! Staff friendly and helpful!!! We will book again here!,1
Improve quality of towels. Neighbors/people going to elevator are noisyHallways are drabShould always have an extra roll of toilet paperGood location near river. Never got a bellman to help us get a taxi,1
Great location and nice view.  The check-in process was quick and easy.,1
This property was excellent service and hospitality,1
Always enjoy my stay at this Hotel. It's my go to when I'm in NYC.  Perfect location in Lower Manhattan,1
I enjoyed the view and the closeness to the Oculus and the different train stations. The only issue that I had was the refrigerators in the room were unplugged and we're not working and they smelled because of them not being plugged in. They said there was a rental fee involved if you wanted the refrigerator. It did not make sense to me that they were a mini bar and nothing was kept cold. I needed the refrigeration for medication and it took a while for them to come up and just plug it in. It was too complicated for my taste.,1
Excellent facility| friendly/helpful staff| convenient to many subway lines| comfortable room| nice pool.,1
The view perfect location for night life family or just a couples trip love it I will come back,1
Rude front desk .. not answering phone promptly .. slow service .. smell of weed in hallways .. dirty carpet. Poor room ventilation .. 60$ for overnight parking .. I asked for microwave and was told it was an extra $35.. this was NOT in amenities.. I showed manager my email she still insisted this was the same as a roll away bed she refused to provide it without charging me ..  I would never stay here again .. they also charged me $50 for overstaying 1 hour after checkout time ..,0
Everything is badass i love it cant wait to go again,1
It was supposed to be a Mommy & Me trip. When your 7yr old says| ‚ÄúMommy this the worst room ever!‚Äù| you know it's bad. She's not even a big traveler and nor doesn't keep her own room clean.lol The room was VERY small with an odor. When I opened what I thought was a refrigerator| turned out to be a minibar that appeared old and smelled like mildew. Our television didn't so I had to let my daughter watch her shows on my phone. Thank goodness for the other attractions in the city to keep her busy. The restaurant was not good at all. The best part was the location.,0
Great views| friendly staff| and excellent service!! This is honestly one of the best hotels I've stayed at in New York City. I've stayed at a lot of hotels| and this was one of the best rooms overall. They even gave us an extra umbrella since it was raining and I didn't have one as I was leaving. Everyone was helpful & accommodating. We got recommendations about the surrounding area of downtown in terms of where to go to eat. The cleaning staff were also especially friendly.,1
My husband and I enjoyed our 2 day stay cation at the Millennium!   The view from our room was tremendous and the pool was a wonderful amenity.   The area around the hotel has tons of dining and shopping options and is very close to park spaces and outdoor activities.,1
The hotel was nice the room fairly spacious for NY hotel but the beds were hard as rocks.  That said when you walk outside to the oculus how could I really complain.,1
Excellent view of the Oculus| Freedom Tower and Hudson River. Location is great| especially since it's close to many subway lines. My kids loved the big indoor pool| which is a real luxury for a Manhattan hotel. Room was spacious but some details were missed. The sofa bed was dated and didn't look very clean. The sheets were already on the sofa bed when we opened it up| complete with a bloodstain on the top sheet! Carpets could also do with a thorough cleaning. Overall| a great stay| but for the price of a junior suite| I would expect clean bedding and carpets.,1
Love this hotel!Best location.Breakfast buffet not great.Go to Eataly for breakfast.Yummy.,1
My kids had the best fun| the location of the hotel was superb,1
GREAT LOCATION! THEY PUMP THIS AMAZING FRAGRANCE THROUGH THE LOBBY AND IT JUST SETS A WONDERFUL MOOD.,1
Absolutely gorgeous view I was on the 32nd floor and it was stunning! Room was alittle small but definitely felt roomy and at home. Parking was $60 dollars didn't know about that so alittle upset but overall had an amazing stay and 10/10 recommend this hotel for your stay in New York ! Easy to find| gorgeous view| and perfect location. Was able to walk to get food and see a lot of different sites. WILL BE BACK!,1
Everything is good,1
Check in process was good| my 8 year old wanted the highest floor possible| so I asked and we were put on the 47th floor overlooking the Oculus and WTC Memorial.  It was a breathtaking view!  The room was clean| neat and comfortable.  I was however unhappy with one thing. I booked a 1 hour massage.  Per the directions on the website| I called a few hours in advance. The gentleman was very nice and was able to call back in moments and confirm that indeed the therapist would be ready for me at 330pm. I showed up at the appointed time and honestly had a fantastic massage and was so relaxed! It was however| completely ruined because as I came out| I asked the therapist where to sign (assuming I could put this on my room bill).  It was then that I was told that I was to pay the therapist directly and that I should have been told that when I booked. Moreover| they only take CASH.  So everyone has 100 cash on them all the time| right? No| I didn't.  So after my super relaxing massage| I am in a panic and have to go to my room get an ATM card| I go to the front desk and ask where the ATM is - THE CLOSEST IS A BLOCK AWAY.... After my relaxing massage| I had to walk a block| get sweaty with the massage oil clogging my pores| pay $3 foreign ATM Fee to pay the massage therapist.  None of this was her fault and I still gave her a tip. I didn't go to the front desk to complain because I just didn't want to worry with it - I wanted to go back to relaxing.,1
"BEWARE.  The Millennium Hilton Downtown REGULARLY oversells its rooms.  I arrived at 7am to check in and was told that there were no clean rooms available at that time.  I stored my luggage as requested and left for my client.  Upon returning at 10:45 pm| I was told that they were oversold -- in fact| that they KNEW they were oversold at 7am (but didn't tell me) -- and 'offered"" to send me to one of their much lower-class sister hotels 15 minutes away.  The worst part (besides not being able to sleep after an exhausting day) -- the desk manager approached her offer as if it fully rectified the situation.  It was the first and last time| I'll stay at the hotel.  There are too many other fine choices in the area to have to tolerate this type of experience and behavior.",0
We love the view and the location !The room is comfy| but on the small side. Shower has very low water pressure,1
It was a great stay | but the young lady at the front desk wasn't friendly or welcoming when I was checking in.,1
Staff at checkin not friendly at all and the guy at the bar rude,1
The pool is in desperate need chlorine and repairs. The mirror walls was dirty and smudged looked very nasty. My job is physically demanding was looking forward to using the steam room but was unable to because the steam room was out of order the main reason why I picked this hotel for the pool and steam room. Had two rooms next to each other one room had a tv that was very poor and snowy and the shower head was terrible. One room was clearly better than the other even though they were right next to each other. This is a famous hotel and for the price per night it should be in better shape! I wanted to have breakfast at the hotel $28 is over the top for a continental breakfast didn't bother looking at the lunch and dinner menu. I paid $6.00 for a can a coke and the sad thing is that the wholesale cost of a can of coke is $0.42| enough said. I love staying at hotels and love spending money at hotels and the only money I spent at this hotel was the $6.00 for the can of coke.,1
Close to everything I wanted to see.  Convenient.  Beautiful views of WTC.,1
The trip was wonderful the location was great right across the street from World Trade Center Memorial. Minor disappointment with the great room the television was not in HD just surprised at that but I would stay here again!,1
st location.,1
Property was clean but no microwave in the room and there is a $35 charge if they bring one. Wasn't sure if that was per day of a flat fee. Location of property is great in the heart of downtown Manhattan.,1
Everything about this hotel was beautiful - the people. the service| the location - EVERYTHING!,1
The location was spectacular| close to the 911 memorial| the Oculos| brooklyn bridge and battery oark where we took the ferry to Liberty Islandt. All within walking distance. The service was superb. The double beds were a bit smaller than imagined but overall wonderful place and the staff extremely helpful. We were iNew York celebrating my moms birthday so we were given a room with a very special view of the city. Breathtaking. Thank you Hilton! We will definitely be returning!,1
We had a room on the 40th floor with amazing views of One World Trade Center| the 9/11 Memorial and the Hudson. The location was outstanding and even though we were on vacation| there were a lot of things for us to see and do in the Financial District. With subway stations right outside the front door we had access to the entire city. As with any older hotel| there were minimal signs of wear and tear but the room was clean and modern and the staff was attentive and helpful. One thing of note is that the AC was not on since it was winter and they do not make it available in any rooms so it got a bit warm and stuffy. The front desk clerk said the only option was to have someone come up and open the windows which we did not want to do. Other than the AC the room was perfect and our stay was amazing.,1
Overall a great stay and would definitely stay again when next in the city for business.,1
A wonderful experience all around,1
Clean hotel. Perfect Location. I strongly recommend it .,1
Hotel was spacious| clean. Front desk and concierge service was excellent. Some TV channels weren't clear.,1
We enjoyed a stay-cation here for my fianc√©'s birthday. Everything was wonderful we had a great stay!,1
Room was clean.  Larger than other nyc properties I have stayed in.   Had a view of 1wtc can't beat that.  Minibar was reasonably priced for a hotel minibar.  Didn't use most amenities the hotel offered so I can't comment.   Check in and check out was easy.   Would stay again,1
They charging my card from no reason | they won't give me my money back,0
Hotel has an amazing view of the Freedom towers. The rooms are a bit dated but the overall value is worth it.,1
Great views & value on rooms on new Years day.  due to the mass exodus that day| we couldn't get into our rooms well past the normal check in time| thus spent way to much time ( 2+ hours) waiting in the lobby to get in our room. we waited because the staff keep telling us that the room would in ready in a few minutes.....,1
The check in & out is very speedy. The kids enjoyed the pool.,1
Our room was very clean and smelled great. However we weren't pleased with the pool....that was really the only reason why I chose the hotel was for my oldest kids. It was dirty and the floors were extremely slippery. I watched two younger children fall and one actually hit his head very hard| luckily got up like a champ.,1
I had a junior suite reserved for weeks and once I checked in they told me they didn't have any.,0
Staff  from check in to check out amazing friendly and helpful!,1
The sida couch was not comfortable| but none usually are! I will stay at this hotel again!,1
This is the FIRST place I'll stay if and when I go back to NYC.,1
Great view and place to stay. Right across from World Trade Center mall! Will definitely recommend,1
I liked everything the pool the room the area. The hotel is old it just needs a little more love.,1
"This should be a flagship location for Hilton.  The rooms are very tiny and ""old"" feeling.  The TV service in the room was almost unwatchable.  They still have standard definition stations with a very grainy and unclear feed.  Wifi was marginal at best.",0
Some small trash on floor| otherwise fine.  Still think charging $13 for wifi this day/age is nuts.,1
The only issue I had was booking through Hotels.com. Upon my arrival they advised me that there were in fact no reservations scheduled for me| even after showing them the print out from Hotel.com website. It was extremely nerve racking knowing that I may not have a room and need to find one on a last minute weekend. Not happy with hotels.com.,1
I love the area and convenient. Subway station ferries so close by. Ground zero and Brookfield mall and statue of liberty ferries,1
A great and vibrant hotel! The rooms are standard but super comfortable and CLEAN!!,1
The hotel was nice and in a very convenient location.,1
Everyone was so kind.  All your employees and manager went above and beyond being so nice to my family.  It was so clean.  My family and I had a beautiful time together.  Thank I for eveything. I will come back here,1
I stayed here over night and I stayed on the 9th floor and my view of the world trade building was gorgeous! The room was very clean| everything looked fairly new. Everything was great. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The only downside was that the kitchen was closed this weekend in the hotel but it did not bother me because I had dinner reservations before my broadway show. I would definitely stay here again!,1
I was so excited to stay at this hotel because it has nice views| and usually I order take out and enjoy a nice late night meals in my hotel room| and microwave and fridge is stated as ‚Äúon request‚Äù| so then when I get to the hotel| they told me I have to pay for the microwave| and when I just telling them nicely that it didn't say that on the website| they replied with ‚Äúwell| now I'm telling you we're charging it.‚Äù Those were their exact words| I was shocked how they speak to guests| and then I was like whatever| charge me then| then they said ok and hang up on me| waited for a hour| didn't have any notice from them so we figured they probably will bring it in the room later| then when we came back after 6hrs| the room still don't have microwave| when I called them again| they told me there was no request for microwave on my file| then I have to ask for it again. After the this experience| I just wanted to have less contact with them| super rude| the hotel view is nice| outside is nice| but inside with the room just looks old and outdated| but gladly| it was clean. Probably will never stay at this hotel anymore.,0
Great view!!! Hotel staff was accommodating and pleasant. Location was perfect.,1
Hotel was great| close to subway and shopping and World Trade Center. Staff very pleasant. And hotel restaurant was ideal. 10/10,1
Clean| spacious room and the staff was excellent and friendly. A wonderful experience.,1
Carpet in our room definitely needs to be replaced. More Lighting in the elevator waiting area in lobby.,1
This is our 4th or 5th time staying here| as we have kids and grandkids close by.  Great location for us w/Occulus so close even when weather is bad you can get far thru ‚ÄúO‚Äù and Brookfield Place.,1
I thought it was great!! The location is amazing and the hotel is nice!,1
We had a terrific stay. Our hotel room was spacious and immaculate. It overlooked the memorial which is a beautiful structure. Great location; easy to get uptown on the subway. We would definitely stay there again.,1
Great location right next to metro station| World trade center and lots of activities to do. The hotel could use little upgrade especially being a Hilton.,1
Employees aren't very knowledgeable at the check in,1
I was not allowed into our room| after having arrived late at night| because something was wrong in their system and my name wasn't on the room appropriately.  They handled this horribly and I had to wait and speak to several people before it was sorted out.,0
One of the best locations in NYC. Great view of the Oculus and the river.,1
The check-in could have been warmer. I've stayed in this hotel before and this time the check-in processs left a lot to be desired in terms of friendliness and hospitality. The room is starting to show it's age and there used to be an arm chair by the window which was missing. Housekeeping didn't come during my stay.,1
Nice hotel | great location| right next to subway. friendly staff. Second time staying here would recommend. Hotel restaurant food is good too. Had dinner a couple of nights and was very good and reasonably priced.,1
The hospitality was truly remarkable impeccable service from the restaurant bartender Manuel| to housekeeping at your beckoned call| would gladly returnüòÑ,1
Nice room.  Great location,1
Perfect location| exquisite view. Concierge was very nice. Elevators were fast.,1
Took a break from the suburbs to spend a long weekend in NYC with my wife now that we are empty nesters.  Indoor pool was a nice touch on cold November days.  Overall| no complaints.,1
Right next to the oculus and world trade center. Indoor pool nice for kids in cooler weather,1
Nice hotel with beautiful views. The carpet and sofa were dirty. Privacy/noise issue. Other than that amazing and an ideal location to be in Manhattan.,1
Wonderful stay| great location| friendly and helpful staff. Rooms are very comfortable.,1
Good location for Lower Manhattan| room size is big and best view by window,1
It is a very nice place to stay. It is convenient to World Trade Center| shopping| donning and an easy subway ride to Time Square. The staff is very nice and helpful. It is nicely decorated and very clean.,1
The hotel room was bigger than most in NYC| which was great. The TV had some issues as the reception on all TVs there is bad apparently. That needs to be addressed. Also| there was a plumbing issue so the faucet made a loud and terrible noise when you first turned on the cold water in the bathroom. Other than those couple of minor issues| the staff was nice| the location was great| and they were very nice to let us leave our bags there before check-in and after checkout| free of charge.,1
Good for the weekend price.  Mattress had dips in it which made it uncomfortable.  Other than that| room was very clean and in good location downtown across from World Trade.  Also close to Subway stations.,1
Perfect location| quiet room. Would definitely come back again.,1
Nice hotel| nice view| next to World Trade Center.,1
Nice Hotel| close to the 911 Memorial| Trinity and St Paul Churches| conveinent to Battery Park.,1
The hotel was amazing! When we arrived at the hotel around 11 AM hoping that we would be able to leave our bags there since we had just flown in that morning and to our surprise our room was ready. It was exceptionally clean| the view was spectacular and the customer service was great. We would love to stay here again. It really made our trip even better.,1
Room was comfortable| brilliant views| good location| subway nearby. Pool really needs an upgrade.,1
The perfect location. The beds are comfortable and the room is a decent size| however they could use some renovating such as the carpet and television but aside from that| it is beautiful with fantastic views and within a short walk to all of your necessities as well as fun activities. The snacks range from $5-9 usd.,1
It was pleasant stay! Location of the hotel is the best part. Little inconvenience with bathroom freshness but overall good stay. Best hotel at this price for staying in downtown. We woke up looking at WTC every day from our room window.,1
Nice hotel close to Restaurants and 911 memorial .,1
Great front desk person and bell hop staff very helpful and attentive rooms were comfy and clean,1
Great downtown location. Across from World Trade Center; close to Wall St and Chinatown.  A number of subway lines mere steps away. I would stay here again.,1
I chose this hotel since my brother would be staying and touring NYC for two nights only.  The hotel needed to be the most accessible| close to the best NYC attractions with a very competitive rate!  And these are all true for the Millenium Hotel in downtown.  The hotel is located in front of the Oculus| few steps from the 9/11 Memorial and walking distance to the Battery Park.  I also got very good rate during our stay!The lobby is nice with bar at the corner.  We did not get a chance to check the other facilities.  The room is a good size| we upgraded to two double beds.  It a little bit outdated and there were showing of wear and tear in the room itself.  There was also a funny smell in the room which we were able to resolve by spraying the room with our perfume. They told my brother it's the bathroom cleaner scent.  All in all it was a pleasant stay aside from the smell.  The location is great!  I will consider to stay again in th future.,1
Nice hotel with helpful staff. Breakfast around 30 dollars but very standard menu,1
We will chose another next time we go to NYC and can't recommend this hotel| unfortunately.,0
Great location| ok rooms. There are not a lot of restaurants nearby but you are just above the subway so everything is easily accessible!,1
Great view!  Enjoyable stay in a very pleasant room. Everyone was very helpful.,1
Really clean room| central location for cabs| food and Times Square site seeing,1
desk was great| breakfast was good.didn't clean our room unless we requested| had to go get clean towels daily,1
Employees super friendly and helpful,1
The breakfast staff was excellent and accomodating. The staff was helpful with feedback.,1
Hotel was clean and staff was friendly. Didn't like the fact that we had to park 2 streets over in a parking garage. No valet parking??? May be a Covid restriction. Otherwise we had a great stay in NYC.,1
Bear the subways and port authority. Breakfast is back. Secured,1
We were very happy with our recent stay! Our room was a good size and clean upon arrival| the bed was very comfortable| and there was always a restock of towels in the hallway to grab at your convenience (housekeeping must be requested due to Covid). The continental breakfast in the morning was a little crowded| but decent. Besides the rude front desk assistance upon check-in| the rest of our front desk experiences throughout our 4 days was much better. I like that you needed your key card to open up the front doors of the hotel and to activate the elevator| which were added levels of security that made me feel safe. Central location to almost everything we did| shops| restaurants| etc. We could either walk to most of our destinations or hop on the subway from the entrance down the street. Overall| we were very satisfied with this hotel and would stay again in the future!,1
We had few good items missing in the room when we arrived but the Evening team was excellent in helping us to get what we need. Two days after staying at the hotel| Management responded to our comment earlier and dropped off most and even extra items we needed since the day team ignored our request the first time. Kitchen team gave excellent service during breakfast.Location of the hotel is great.,1
Very close to Time Square! Nice parking nearby! Wonderful breakfast!!,1
All the stuff of the hotel were very friendly specially Fatima the lady that works at breakfast buffet was super friendly and greets everyone that walks in.,1
Hotel was perfect! We stayed on the 28th floor with a city view.  Location was ideal to Times Square| subway and restaurants.  We loved our stay!,1
It was nice,1
Clean and convenient!,1
Good breakfast,1
Very well located and near a metro station,1
Exceent location| clean and modern. Only thing not that great was the wifi,1
excellent location.  Very clean,1
Very disappointing!! First stay in New York since Covid and the rooms have gone to poop!  Literally. Poop. There is a fluid smell in the rooms and the toilet and the showers backed up. Asked to be moved to a new room and was told they couldn't til someone checked out. No refund available either. Asked how to see some sites that were further downtown and was told to ask someone at the subway‚Ä¶.,0
Walking distance to everything you could possibly need.,1
Walking distance from bus terminal! Clean.Needed trash emptied after first day. Long wait for elevators at peak times.,1
Loved location,1
The hotel is in a great location! The rooms were clean and the bathroom nice with new amenities.,1
It is a good place to stay.,1
Good location to theater district.,1
Great location| one block from Broadway and all the happening. Easy to get to the subway.,1
Upon arrival we were assigned a room that was no vacant. It was an embarrassing encounter when we walked in on people in their room. We also had to ask 3 times for a couple extra bath towels. The person at the front desk seemed very inconvenienced when I approached the desk and asked for a towel| which they did not have. I like Hampton hotels| but this one in Times Square was awful. The breakfast was terrible too.,0
This hotel was very convenient for our trip: breakfast included was the part| delicious and different every morning.  The Location for this property was great| it was a walking distance to every place we intended to go restaurants| subway| Time Square and more. ..Room service was fast and friendly as well as the front desk staff. For sure if I have an opportunity to come back to NY  I will be staying in this hotel again.,1
Great place to stay. It is also in the perfect location. just 2 min walk from PABT. Everything was good,1
The room was so clean. Check in was fast and easy.,1
Staff was friendly,1
Room was a bit small and a fridge would have been nice but overall it was a great place to stay. I would definitely recommend to friends. Thank you for making our trip enjoyable.,1
I spent two nights at this hotel and I thoroughly enjoyed my experience! The room was clean| bed was very comfortable. Most importantly| they went beyond to make us feel clean and safe during the pandemic. I would return next time when I visit NY.,1
Very Clean| Nice Staff. Breakfast was delicious. Check out was so easy.,1
Being close to time square was our aim and it worked out well..,1
No maid service Slow elevators,1
We were there for 3 days| our room wasn't cleaned once. No clean towels (we asked for some)| trash wasn't taken out| ran out of toilet paper| no coffee refills. We were very disappointed.,0
Very centrally located in times square. Staff was very friendly and helpful when asking for directions.  My only real complaint is never once did house keeping come to our room  to make beds or give us fresh towels. Not sure if that was due to covid restrictions? We seen housekeeping around and figured they would come eventually. We helped ourselves to towels from their cart that was always kept right outside our room.,1
Clean and pretty just too small the area of breakfast,1
We had a nice stay overall.  They did have a nice breakfast| but we're not always prompt at getting items restocked.  They ran out of things towards the ending time and did not restock even though there was a line.  They have 3 elevators to service 30  floors so we had to wait at times to get an elevator.Due to COVID-19| they are not doing daily cleaning but it is available if you ask.,1
The location was great! We walked to most places we were looking to go! We did not know that that the roof top was for public access| so only checked it out on the morning we left. Would recommend and stay again!,1
All of the computer services and facilities were available. Breakfast is free and wonderful. The only complaint is not with Hampton but the city of New York which is much dirtier than a few years ago.,1
Needed to do a better job in cleaning. There was a wash towel in the refrigerator and had to ask two days in a roll to clean it out. But other than that it was great.,1
Great location close to every sigh seeing place.,1
Rochelle @ the front desk only checked a note on our account after i kept pressing her for answers about a cab being odered for our departure.,1
It was the worst ever in my life| we trade unfairly. So we left the hotel one day early. Our reservation until 6/23- we left 6/22.,0
My husband and I very much enjoyed our stay at the Hampton Inn. The location was wonderful for being able to walk to some of the sights| the room was clean| and the breakfast downstairs was very convenient as well. The staff was wonderful| always friendly and they were even accomadating to our request for an early check in.,1
Great hotel really close to theaters| Times Square and the subway. Sadly| currently no theater going on| but the location was still wonderful!,1
A very nice hotel| near Times Square and the subway. Comfortable rooms. Nice bathroom.,1
I love the room so much. The bathroom is so nice and big. Very clean hotel. Friendly staff. Will definitely be going back.,1
I like the location. I did not like that not enough soap was in the room.,1
Very nice and clean. Super comfortable beds. Pillows can be more firm. Clean bathrooms and tastefully chosen room furnishings.,1
I liked everything,1
Liked the quietness and cleanliness of the room. Didn't like not having on-site parking. Didn't like smell of weed that came into the room several times.,1
Love how close the hotel was to Times Square! Such a great area.,1
We had a great stay here. Our room was clean| check in and check out was fast & super nice| beds were comfortable and we felt this hotel was serious about Covid. Breakfast was better than expected. They validate our garage parking so ended up paying only $42/night. They even gave us a closet to keep our luggage after checkout which was a great help. Overall great stay.,1
The property was 1/2 a block from broadway and Times Square| yet it was super quiet inside the hotel. The staff was polite and accommodating when we had an issue.,1
The staff members were very friendly and helpful! The area was in a central location| which was convenient. The room was clean and everything worked well. There were some other guests smoking at times because I could smell cigarettes or marijuana in the hallway and elevator on occasion.,1
The view was amazing! Checking in and checking out was smooth and easy and everyone was so polite and kind. I highly recommend for a couples retreat or a personal getaway.,1
Nothing fancy about the place| but it was okay. The room size was normal. You need to ask to get the housekeeping to come clean. Location is perfect| very close to the Times square. Free breakfast was either bagel with cream cheese or pre-made biscuit sandwich (egg| cheese| sausage) that you would microwave for 1 minute| juices| coffee| and fruits. No bar or restaurant in the hotel. The best part of this hotel was that they have laundry room. $2 for washer and $2 for dryer (quarters needed). If you plan to do laundry pack your detergent and dryer sheet.,1
Property was good Times Square has gotten really dirty which doesn't help the property and trash cans were spilling over right in front of the property but other than that| they did a good job of maintaining cleanliness.,1
This was a great hotel!,1
Queen room was larger than what you will find in many Manhattan hotels.  Room was very clean and in good condition.  Bathroom was clean and well stocked with towels and soap etc.  Very quiet and I was directly opposite elevator.  Close to Penn Station and Times Square.,1
No microwave or refrigerator in the room is very small,0
I liked that their was security at the front door. Loved everything!,1
Very clean| friendly staff and always unexpectedly quiet no matter how booked the hotel is. Nice renovation of the entrance and even a security guard after hours!,1
Good| clean place to stay and really close to Time square. Overall was everything was ok| there's no microwave or fridge. Breakfast was packaged muffins|bagels| fruit| cereal.,1
Literally the first review I've ever written and it must go to all of the staff at this hotel. They were all truly amazing!,1
Great city view.,1
One block from Times Square and a subway station right at the corner. Easy to get to| great installations and amenities.,1
It was good!,1
Everything we needed for this trip. Free breakfast is  rare| so much appreciated. Front desk staff| PM and AM| were absolutely excellent and friendly. Elevators slow and people piled in| so not much social distancing.,1
The room was spacious and clean. Just as pictured. One block from Times Square and the subway. The elevator was excruciatingly slow| be prepared to wait. Other than that it couldn't of been better.,1
Nice hotel and in a good location. I was kinda expecting more than cereal for breakfast everything morning though.,1
It is a great location to explore NYC. The staff was very friendly. They also had a place to hold our bags on the last day while we explored before our flight. Would definitely stay there again.,1
Nice hotel in nyc| 5 bloks from times sq. Good rooms| there is gym| and lundgry| and a meeting room.,1
The stay at the hotel was great I wish you had parking for us,1
It was so close to times square and transportation. It was centrally located. Only 2 elevators and parkong is always a hassel in NYC.,1
Everything in Times Square is just walking distance pretty much. Convenient location.,1
As someone who stayed at many hotels till pandemic surprised at how good hotel was.Service was 10. Room 10. breakfast 8.Perfect location and hotel People very helpful and Friendly with a smile.Woul stay again,1
Great location! Updated room| but small...as expected. Great staff and quiet.,1
excellent value. profesional staff and priviledge location.,1
Having to park so far away from the hotel wasn't pleasing,1
Great place to stay Clean| nice and quietClose to everything,1
It was Quiet Nice and Friendly I Wouldn't Mind Staying Here Again Also I Would Refer Others,1
Everything Everything Everything Everything Everything,0
The staff were friendly and the rooms were clean and nice,1
I love the hotel area the room but there's no on-site parking,1
Breakfast could have been better| other than serving guest a bagel and yogurt| Breakfast was very limited. Also| I wish there was a refrigerator in my room| but there was not. Thus| I was unable to keep my perishables cold. However| the staff was accommodating by providing free water| and offering to fix a room issue fast. DO NOTE the location is a little sketchy at night| but the lobby has security and the doors are locked| with access to rooms only available by key-card. Overall| good hotel| with an awesome view from the free rooftop| and the free water was a nice touch.,1
Spotless room| fast check in| no hiccups at all. Highly recommended,1
Overall| wonderful stay| good breakfast| nice lobby,1
Worst internet service. Dirty towels| broken shower. Really bad experience. Happy that I was only one night in this hotel .,0
Close to everything . Lobby was nice . Rooms clean,1
Excellent location| super convenient| clean| comfy and appreciated the sleek modern design touches| lustrous vibes| totally going back!!,1
I liked the fact that it was minutes away from time square,1
No fridge in room| not pleased with that.,1
This place has bed bugs,0
Nice | clean. We stayed for 2 nights. Very convenient to time square and metros.,1
Very clean and comfortable with a friendly staff in the heart of the city. That being said find another city to visit.,1
Good hotel| great location!,1
Very nice Hotel! Very clean and the staff was great. The best part is how close it is to Times Square| literally around the corner from it. Loved it!,1
It is a place to stay while in New York. Recommended,1
Great service-clean like you won't believe,1
Just wanted  so.e away  time,1
I very much enjoyed my stay with you.,1
We stayed upon the 16th floor| very fast elevators I believer there are 30 floors in total. Comm,1
Amazing front desk service| after a long day driving being welcomed by good service is imperative.,1
Location is great but Check-in experience was very bad and| the bathroom was not clean.,0
This was a great place to stay for the money. Everything was nice and clean....from the hotel lobby to the rooms. It was a nice place to retreat to after site seeing.   Oh....and the staff were very professional and friendly. Conveniently located to everything you need and attractions to see ! I plan to stay here again on my next trip to New York.,1
My room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. It's a nice contemporary space. The only annoyances were from other guests on my floor. They were celebrating someone's birthday and people kept coming in and out of the room during really late hours. I could hear the door slam each time. Also people kept having conversations in the hall. These things made it difficult for me to get to sleep. I came there for peace and quiet and an escape from my family during this long period of quarantine so that was a bit disappointing. The free breakfast was mostly coffee| muffins| orange juice and cereal. It would've been nice to have a hot breakfast. The staff was friendly and helpful. Easy check in and check which took less than 5 minutes each time. Overall I mostly enjoyed my stay. I'd stay here again. Hopefully next time I'll have better neighbors.,1
King size bedrooms are small. Can't connect anything to the tv and they are old as well. Their alarm clock has no Bluetooth for you to connect your phone or laptop to play music and entertain yourself. There are no refrigerators in the room. Basically| their rooms are dry with no entertainment. Boring,0
It was a great stay highly recommended! Me and my girlfriend had a great time.,1
The hotel was excellent overall. Loved my room. Was very quiet and relaxing.,1
It was amazing ! Staff was friendly and the hotel is really nice and clean.,1
Excellent experience with staff. Furnishings in room were comfortable though a bit dated. Appreciated being on a high floor and the complimentary breakfast.,1
Perfect location| no swimming pool.  Rooms a little small but over excellent hotel.  I eilk definetly say again.  Staff is wonderfull and very helpful .  People make the difference| what a great place.,1
Great location|friendly staff|Great choice for breakfast Definitely stay here again,1
Perfect location| clean room| great breakfast| good rate on parking| friendly staff.,1
I loved the little things the staff did like text me before check-in to see if I needed help with anything. Lilly was especially helpful. The location is awesome and breakfast was good. The carpeting (apparently carpet squares) in the rooms is oddly thin and has a cheap pattern that brings down the entire experience. The towels are also thin. But| the bed was comfortable| and the room was quiet. The elevators can be slow.  I was also disappointed that the hotel would not agree to let me cancel and rebook when I accidentally selected the wrong room type| even though I was trying to get 2 rooms and we would be there for 4 days in one of them| and they would not have lost any money. Staff had no discretion. Overall| it was good and I would stay there again. Be aware that there are 2 basic room types at least on the upper floors - one has a hallway and the other does not. Also| be advised that if you choose a nonrefundable rate| they really truly mean it.,1
Excellent service with everyone at the Front Desk!,1
Excellent place to stay!!! Great Breakfast and coffee| tea & hot chocolate always available! The room was very nice| clean and the beds were comfortable! Very convenient location and the price is great! It will be our go to pick from now on!!!,1
I loved the location and the breakfast in the morning,1
Overall happy with my stay except the soundproofing of the windows are poor and the blinds were not doing a great job at blacking out the light should you want to sleep in . Great location and great value for nyc though .,1
The staff were polite and very helpful. Lived the free breakfast.,1
We've stayed 7 nights and all was good| the location is very handy and close to metro and Times Square. Breakfast is included but can be very busy in some hours (you can also take it to your room in case there is no place to sit).,1
This is my second time here. Great location to everything. Excellent service and always comfortable and clean!,1
It was a two night weekend stay in NYC. We were checked in immediately upon our arrival| without waiting.  Staff was quick and accommodating. The hotel was very clean and updated| comfortable rooms and beds| very close and walking distance to almost tourists points of interest| just few steps on time square subway station| and blocks away from Time Square| with great restaurants around.  Excellent full buffet breakfast daily in the lobby with lot of choices| fresh fruits and fresh 100% juices| bacon| sausages| eggs| lot of  good and delicious pastries| the 24 hour variety of coffees and tea's in the lobby| with 24 hr drinking water. Toilet and bathrooms were clean| with regular refilling and changing of clean towels and toiletries without asking them. Quiet room for us| so we had a nice sleep all our stay. And the view was excellent| overlooking the city. Elevator wise? We didn't experienced any long wait even if we were in the 19th floor. Price was cheap if you consider the all services that was provided. There was a $20 security deposit per night| but as soon as we checked out| it was automatically returned back. So we only paid the rate we got from hotel.com. We enjoyed our stay in this Hotel. Excellent in NYC. We will stay again when we come back| and highly recommended.,1
Employees aways greeted us and were pleasant .  Very close to Times Square.,1
A Chair in the room would have been nice| no refrigerator or microwave either,1
The room was very well-kept. Very clean very easy to access for us the front desk was very courteous and would recommend to all our friends,1
Great location| clean room| all working fine.On the down side| very busy elevators  and very busy breakfast room.,1
The location was excellent for our short trip to New York for some shopping| just off Times Square and close to the bus terminal,1
Staff was very friendly and helpful. Elevators and breakfast do get crowded in the am.,1
Great location| easy access to a number of subway stations whilst also being in close walking distance to a number of tourist locations.,1
Attentive service and excellent location.  Friendly staff| prompt when room available prior to check in time and allowed late check out.,1
I liked everything about the hotel!Most of all| felt safe there!Everyone was very professional and knowledgable!Everything was very clean!  Loved that!Within walking distance for most of our trip.Would definately stay there again! Breakfast was awesome!Only wish they had a shuttle service to and from airport.,1
Very good food service attractive clean staff are good,1
Hotel was clean|  breakfast was good|  and there staff was great,1
The location was PERFECT.  We were near everything| and never had to take a taxi anywhere.  Broadway and Times Square are right outside the door.  The concierge helped us with getting tickets to a sold-out show that we never thought we could possibly get into.  The hotel was clean| comfortable| and (best of all) affordable.  A wonderful weekend to celebrate my daughter's sixteenth birthday!,1
Staff really helpful. Room comfortable although the view out onto 41 st wasn't great. Not an issue for us as its just a place to sleep. Coffee in the entrance 24/7Good WiFiBreakfast included in deal was really nice.,1
Excellent location| and it was perhaps the best value of any play I've stayed in Manhattan.,1
Loved the free buffet breakfast and free coffee all day!,1
Location| cleanliness| friendly staff| good breakfast,1
Everything about this hotel was really good. The room we had was lovely with comfortable beds. The breakfast was great| with plenty of choice and the location was perfect. Overall we were really pleased we stayed in this hotel and would return.,1
Me and my husband stayed 3 nights at this hotel it was a mini vacation for us ....the hotel was very clean| nice rooms| the location was perfect 3 to 5 minutes away from the time square ....the staff was super friendly and very friendly ....I will definitely comeback to this hotel next time I am in manhattan:)),1
It was a great stay.  The place is clean and friendly and safe.  You even get a complete breakfast and they offer valet parking at a reasonable price! I will return.,1
Great location! The bed was very comfortable| shower was great. Rooms are a tad small.,1
The location of the hotel is great. We were within walking distance of many places we needed or wanted to go. We were close to the ABC studios| we walked to Central Park| we walked to the Sightseeing Ferry Boat Pier| and there is a Walgreens for knick-knacks near. There are many great restaurants around and a McDonald's across the street if you like. The staff was friendly. There are no microwaves in the room| but there is one in the lobby area that can be used to warm up food. Housekeeping did a great job with daily service. Also| there is great value in breakfast being included as that is one meal you don't have to buy. Most of the other hotels in the area does not include breakfast. The breakfast room was crowded each morning though| but that is to be expected if the hotel is full. The rooms are smaller than usual but that is also to be expected in New York. The elevators took you up and down quickly. All in all| my family and I were pleased with this hotel.,1
It is a wonderful location!i would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends.,1
Our room was very clean!  The location was right next to Times Square| it was so close to everything!  Everyone we came into was lovely and the breakfast was great.  I will stay here again!,1
All about the breakfast here - there was a wide selection and lots available! The workout facility was also top notch.,1
Great  location  . Spacious  . Clean. Good  customer  services  . Good breakfast  such  a bonus  in nyc . Location  can't  beat . Reasonable  price for January  in nyc,1
Great location. Friendly front desk and clean hotel.,1
I love that the hotel is a few walks away from Time Square and very close to Red Lobster. I'll get a room with a view next time. The room next to the elevator does not have a nice city view.,1
Very friendly.  Great location!  Will definitely stay again!,1
Breakfast room too small for number of guests Difficult to find a seat,1
The staff was very pleasant and accommodating.  The room was very clean and comfortable.  The complimentary breakfast was plentiful.  The free wifi worked perfectly.  The hotel was very convenient to where my meeting was.,1
The location was great!  Also| we loved the free coffee and tea all day!  The breakfast was decent.  We didn't think the service was overly great.  I didn't get a lot of smiles from any of the front desk people.,1
Amazing location| staff extremely helpful|loved the to go bag breakfast,1
The location is wonderful for theatre and restaurants. Our room was very quiet,1
You cannot beat the location! Everything was great from checking in to checking out. They have friendly and courteous staff. The room was just enough space for my family in a NYC room and was very clean.  Only negative thing I can say was that one elevator was down| and it took a long time to get an elevator on the morning of check-out.,1
Great location| nice rooms (though small| but we didn't mind at all)| friendly staff.,1
Great location and welcoming employees Loved the hot tea/ coffee/ hot chocolate bar.,1
Excellent location - right in Times Square 24/7 good coffee !Room was clean and quiet. Comfortable bed,1
Broken shower facet and cold showers were recipe for awful stay!,0
We had a good experience.  Good location for broadway shows.  Only somewhat negative comment was only three elevators - sometimes long wait times.,1
Great location. Very clean. Friendly staff. Elevators were slow and the continental breakfast needs more options.,1
Staff are very friendly and nice. This time of the year hotel is very busy. Just need to be patient to wait for elevator. We definitely will come back to stay when visiting NYC.,1
This hotel is great! The staff was friendly and  helpful. I was able to check into my room early after arriving on a red eye flight. So lucky! Breakfast each day was always delicious and well stocked. Hotel is very clean. The location cannot be beat! Walking distance to so many Broadway theaters| restaurants| Times Square| Bryant Park| the subway| etc.I will stay here again when I return to NYC!,1
The location is great and within walking distance of everything someone visiting NY would want to experience. The staff is friendly and always eager to assist.,1
All of the employees were very friendly and helpful.,1
Loved it.  Front desk staff are great.  Valet was excellent.  Room was clean.  Location was great.  Thank you!,1
The staff were very friendly. Really enjoyed having a hot breakfast every morning. Enjoyed that they had coffee| tea| hot chocolate and water available at all times. It was very nice to come back from walking around the city and be able to get something to drink. The location was excellent| within walking distance to so many of the sites to see in New York City.,1
I normally stay at the larger named hotels in Manhattan| but the prices were outrageous at this time of the year.  I was pleasantly surprised with this property| especially for mid-town Manhattan.  The hotel and room were modern| the staff was extremely friendly| and the breakfast was hearty.  It was centrally located to the theaters| shopping| and sights.,1
We liked everything| staff was courteous and helpful.  Breakfast was excellent.  Could not have been happier,1
Room was a little small as was the bathroom   Staff was nice,1
Lilly and Clearance treated my friends and me like we were famous| nice for a change,1
The employees are the ‚ÄúBest ‚Äú excellent breakfast and great rooms. Best value in NY,1
Great location for a visit to nyc walking distance to much of the sight seeing.,1
Service at reception was fabulous. It was a longish stay so I met different staff that week. All were always most helpful. Thank you friends at Hampton Inn.,1
Breakfast was delicious| great service. Great location| close to public transportation and easy to and from Airport.,1
Construction noise during the night should stop| 11:00-7:00,1
My only complaint is the fact that there were street performers drumming till past 11.   That's not HAMPTON Inn's fault though.,1
Can't beat it.  Right combination of good price and good product.,1
Close to restaurants and theatreEasy to findClose to train station,1
Coffee and tea available 24 hours Complementary buffet was also very nice,1
Staff very friendly and accommodating.  There was really nothing to not like.,1
Clean| able to help us out when we had another hotel cancel on us and they had rooms for us at Hampton - lifesaver!!! In the middle of everything and so so close to the subway and literally anything you can think of!,1
Location was great!!,1
i was welcome to my room reservation in my way out of airport. they were expecting already make sure the can assist me on any last minuteinconvenience may happened or other wise| my reservation was awaiting me. When I arrived| I felt like home. friendly faces| room ready.Freshness|cleaning and plenty space was part of my room. Privacy and peace was what I enjoy the most. Next day| after a resting night| amazing breakfast to start my day. My hotel have all.,1
Great location and excellent service.  The hotel held our luggage for free since we arrived early and even let us eat breakfast there.  Breakfasts are good for a free hotel breakfast- the kids loved it and it was a great perk.  Staff were super friendly and helpful.  This will be my go to hotel for future NYC trips.  Highly recommend for families.,1
Room is small but very clean!  Property location was perfect for catching a broadway show.,1
Great location. Great breakfast. The staff were helpful and friendly.,1
The hotel staff was always very friendly. Our room was ready when we arrived before check in time. There were cookies and coffee in the lobby. And the daily breakfast was excellent.,1
Great time|... good free breakfast| coffee| tea & hot chocolate 24 hours fabulous|   Great location for the theater. Everything is walkable,1
We loved it !!! We will be back !!!,1
Close to the theater and Times Square. Great location.,1
Before we even arrived your staff sent me a welcome text to let me know they were expecting me and if I needed anything to let them know. Upon arrival and during my entire stay the staff was extremely friendly| helpful and never once without a smile on their faces. A few years ago we stayed here and Tobo was awesome. My kids begged me to stay here again and we did and Tobo was still there and remembered us. He and all the staff took great care of us. The hotel is in a perfect location to Times Square and subway stations. Valet is wonderful and the property is extremely clean| secure and comfortable. The services offered for free and the knowledgeable staff make getting around and figuring out where to eat| what to do and how to get there easy. Housekeeping is top notch! This will be the ONLY hotel I ever stay at when in NYC! It is worth every dollar spent to make your vacation a relaxing one.,1
I liked the breakfast and the location | right in the heart of time square. What was inconvenient was the parking situation but other then that it was great,1
Lilly (staff ) is excellent  !,1
Service folks| especially in high pressure breakfast environment were fantastic.,1
Great location| clean and safe. loved the free coffee and tea all day.,1
Great location. Some amenities disappointments. Someone at valet parking drove my new car 134 miles. Have not yet heard from hotel how they are going to deal with this.,1
This was one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. I'll number the reasons. 1) 24-hour check-in. Unlike most hotels that only allow check-in after 3 p.m.| this hotel offers check-in at any time. That's awesome because waiting until 3 p.m. to check-in is a waste of half of the day! 2) Staff is super nice. I am deaf and travel alone| but the front desk workers (sorry| I didn't get their names) were super nice and one of them even know sign language! 3) The rooftop terrace is AMAZING. The hotel really need to promote this terrace. It is beautiful. You can use your key card to access it| I think from 8 p.m. to 8 p.m. 4) When you first get to your room| do not sit on the bed. Do not lie/lay on the bed. Don't even look at the bed. The beds are SO comfortable that you will not want to leave the room at all. 5) I have mobility issues and just an FYI to anyone else - the bathroom floor is super slippery with bare feet. But to be clear - this is not the hotel's fault in ANY way. It's my bum feet. 6) The Expedia listing doesn't mention it but there is a $40 deposit required| but that is super cheap compared to other hotels and it was back in my account in a day or two after I checked out. 7) The location is AMAZING. Very close to Times Square and a subway entrance but also far enough away not to be super crowded. 8) FREE hot breakfast in the mornings! Unheard of in NYC. This hotel is basically completely perfect.,1
Breakfast menu for eastern Muslims need to be considered..,1
Very Nice Hotel!!! Great location in Time square closed to all attractions and tours. Rooms are comfortable and very cleanNice bed and best pillows ever wish I could have take one home lol Brealfast is nice and complementary coffee water tea and cookies every day is a PlusHighly recomend hotel,1
Very good location| comfortable beds| staff happy to hold your bags before you check in/ after you checkout.Free breakfast however the breakfast room very small for the amount of people| you struggle to get a table and very crowded,1
This property is a great hotel in a great location! Will definitely stay there again,1
Great location  - will definitely use this location again.  Breakfast included was a bonus as well as the option of tea or coffee 24/7 and the small snack shop onsite was great to for a late night beer or ice cream.,1
Loved the convenient location| breakfast buffet| and afternoon tea and cookies.,1
Location was great.The hotel is clean and everything works as advertised.,1
I like the location. I suggest you to add quesadillas to the breakfast menu.,1
I was really impressed with the cleanliness and the service. Everyone that worked there was extremely helpful and friendly.,1
Staff was great. I would stay again at this establishment.,1
The hotel was clean and like newGreat view of downtown So Close to Times Square Weather was amazing the city was amazing,1
We had a great time and the hotel was in a very convenient location. Close to great food and subway.,1
Staff was super nice. Breakfast was great. Elevators were terribly slow.,1
Great location but the lifts are terrible ....they are inadequate and when it's busy expect to be waiting for several minutes and to be packed into the small lift space when you do manage to get one,1
The room key card we were given did not work. We had to go back to the desk to get it replaced three times. It was annoying getting stuck in the elevator going to the highest floor because the key card does not work| then going back and forth to the front desk to get it replaced.,0
Fantastic place to stay and it's right next to Times Square| we were on the top floor (31st) and it was free from the noise of traffic. Rooms were clean and well looked after on a daily basis. The most notable part of the stay were the staff| from the breakfast staff to the concierge to cleaners| everyone was polite and happy to see you| they greeted you every time they saw you and made you feel very welcome. The breakfast choices were fine| from cereals| to waffles| bakery| fresh fruits and all sorts of beverages. Only slightly negative thing is the wait times for the lifts can be a bit long at times| especially during breakfast time| however that is a minor point.  There is also a private roof top view which is a bonus.,1
Location was good as it was in the heart of Times Square.  There was street noise due to traffic| sirens etc. Air con in room.  Nice touch was a coffee machine in the room plus free coffee and tea 24/7.  This hotel also includes breakfast.,1
The breakfast was nice to have BUT| the eggs were scrambled with milk one day or it was a cheese omelet.Maybe have eggs without dairy as an option,1
Although I didn't need any extra assistance| I observed the manager several times helping others.  Enough so| that it made an impression on me.  The breakfast staff was efficient and the food was good and plentiful.I will definitely stay at the Hampton Inn again when I go to New York.,1
Close to Broadway theatres and train station. Right in the core of Times Square,1
Prime location if you're in NYC to see shows. Friendly staff. Fantastic breakfast. Comfy bed. Clean| modern| great value.,1
Excellent location| just around 2 mins from Times Square.  Great location to explore the rest of New York.,1
The location is great| near timesquare.  The room is nice and comfortable.  However| the elevator is too slow.  Breakfast is very crowded.,1
"The location of this hotel is great| near everything| and it includes a decent free breakfast| and 24/7 Coffee bar in the lobby. The staff is friendly| efficient| and helpful! I only wish that the rooms had a refrigerator. The lobby itself is also very small with limited seating| so enjoying a cup of coffee and reading a book in the lobby with a ""side"" of people watching is really not an option at this hotel. But if you plan to use it as a launching spot for other activities| you cannot beat it for the price!",1
Very accomodating staff|very clean hotel and modern,1
Excellent service| breakfast| location.Lilly you're very nice.I recommend 100%,1
I made a reservation for Aug 19 for one night and by mistake I selected Aub 18| so when I show up Monday they told me it was canceled due to not show. I asked for some  kind of discount or help to make the new reservation it it was impossible they were so unhelpful and told me to look online if I want to get a better deal.  Afeter hours waiting I made a new reservation thru Hotel.comI want to mention that I should be at least reimburse for the taxes since I did not use the service. All I want is at least a credit for future reservation or the refund of the taxes that I'm entitled.,0
Very Clean centralized  location| close to e everything,1
The area was very convenient to all theaters and restaurants. The only comment I have is that the breakfast area is too small for the number of people using it.,1
The hotel is within walking distance to Times Square so we were able to walk to many events.  The breakfast was good.  However the room we had we paid extra for the view and was disappointed.  It was not worth paying extra for the view because it was mostly blocked by buildings.,1
Like the location| love the people| very friendly and accomodating üòä,1
Great location| helpful staff| elevators slow in the morning but other than that| no complaints,1
the location was perfect for our visit to the city.,1
Very good place| right in Times Square and everything with reach of walk| underground just outside the hotel entrance.,1
The location was perfect amd central to everything.,1
Excellent breakfast| friendly staff and perfect location,1
Great location and good basic breakfast and free coffee all day long!,1
I stayed here with my daughter and 2 of her friends to celebrate her birthday! It was a great location| covenient to everything. The hotel was clean and so was our room. My daughter was only 3 1/2 weeks post ACL surgery and still really wanted to go on this trip. She thought crutching around wouldn't be ‚Äútoo bad‚Äù she was pretty miserable fast and when I inquired at the hotel about where I could possibly rent a wheel chair they told me they had one we could borrow! It was fantastic and definitely made our trip more comfortable and made it easier for us to get around. The customer service was great!,1
Will stay there again,1
The hotel is located in a perfect spot| the breakfast is good but the housekeeping could be better | our room one day was fixed at 6 pm and they left no sheet in our beds.,1
"Superb!!!! The staff is simply terrific. Always helpful and friendly. Whenever we called for something for the room (towels| etc.) it always came quickly and friendly. The hotel itself was very clean upon arrival and during our stay. The hotel was very busy by the way. July. The breakfast is phenomenal for a ""free breakfast"". Once morning i spilled food on my shirt and one of the nice staff happened to notice| offered to get a bottle of water to help remove the stain. Everyone always spoke with a good morning and good night or how are you today. My only very small complaint was the pillows but| my husband says I am am tough critic on pillows because I have neck issues. We already have plans to visit NYC again soon and will be booking here.",1
It was near the subway station which helps to move fast around the city. It is near all the interesting places in Times Square. The staff was very amicable and helpful. The checking time is very fast.,1
Could have not wasted leftovers!  üôÅ,1
Very close walk to Times Square. Very close to walk to a lot of other popular spots.,1
Great bed| quiet rooms| excellent breakfast buffet. I didn't like that the elevators where so crowded that we have to wait several minutes or go down stairs form the 7th floor.,1
Great location.  We plan to stay there again.   The elevators could take a fair amount of time during the morning,1
The hotel was awesome.. I would book here again if in Midtown. One of the lower rates for Times Square but everything was clean comfortable and in great condition,1
Location was great. Breakfast was not. Need to upgrade elevators.,1
Only complaint was breakfast was too crowded to enjoy.,1
This Hampton Inn was great! It is steps from Times Square| Broadway shows| the bus station| and tour buses. The staff was very helpful and friendly. My only issue was the wait for elevators. Our room was small| but that's to be expected in Midtown. It was very clean and comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay!,1
Very helpful staff and perfect location. Best pay for ne is the Free water bottles in summer time at front desk,1
Bathroom. Exhaust fan was not working and the stink remained . It was not fixed after complaining .,1
It was great but breakfast was very crowded and couldn't find seating.,1
Location was basically just one street away from Times Square| but the street the hotel is on is quiet. Everything we wanted to see in the area was within walking distance and there were subway stops nearby for anyone who wants to venture further out. I was pleasurably surprised by the size of the hotel room after hearing about tiny NY hotel rooms - our room was a very good size. Beds were comfortable and room was very clean. Free breakfast was a great perk. Would definitely recommend this hotel to other travellers.,1
"Kris at front desk was great helper and provided us with answer to all our questions. The only thing that we didn't see in this hotel is swimming pool and we suggest to build one ""if there is a way to do that""",1
Elevators were either extremely slow or always full so we had to walk up 7 flights of stairs multiple times a day. There were too many people and not enough room for breakfast so the one day we fought the crowd we had to stand up and eat or walk up the 7 flights of stairs to sit in our room. Staff were very friendly and helpful| rooms were clean and kept nice and clean for us.,1
loved the location and the ease to get to the different attractions nearby. Had a wonderful stay...great| hot continental breakfast.,1
The room was clean| the bed was comfortable| the breakfast was very good and the staff was very courteous and helpful. I definitely will stay again and recommend it highly,1
No shower cap & refrigerator. Breakfast was very good.,1
This was a great room.  Transportation was really close by and easy to use.  The desk staff were uber friendly and helpful.  The room was tiny which is to be expected| but the sliding bathroom door with no bathroom fan left little to no privacy.,1
Great location.  3 minute walk from the main attractions of Times Square. Clean hotel| secure elevator| would gladly stay here again.,1
Best place I have stay in for awhile. Very friendly and usb chargers in room and breakfast area| big for us as we seem to need to keep are travel companion charged (iphone). Breakfast is very good with lots of variety and fresh fruit. Nice refreshment area in lobby for free coffee tea and water Great location walked to Empire State Building you could walk to the intrepid . We walked to time square it's very close and Central Park it's a bit of a hike likely a mile,1
The room was a bit small for what I paid| but it was close to Times Square without being in the middle of the crowds. It was close to so much I wanted to do and see. The breakfast was the only thing I had to complain about. The coffee was really bitter and I put creamer and sugar in. There weren't many options. I went for the scrambled eggs and they were SO watery. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. My home bed and pillows felt super hard in comparison.,1
Great service| clean room| water tea & coffee available always in room and at reception,1
Everything was great except for the breakfast area.  It isn't big enough to house all the people trying to get breakfast at the same time.,1
Loved the hospitality and so close to everything. I wish the best had been bigger but it was a lovely room and very clean.,1
The elevators were in adequate| three for 35 floor and the were Small.  The staff was excellent and the same with the location of the property| morning breakfast was good and adequate.,1
Nicely renovated rooms| included breakfast and wifi was great. Central location| very handy,1
"Location was great with easy access to Time Square and Broadway shows| but know that you will hear sirens| music| etc and see lights at all times of the day! Our ""city view"" was more like the tops/sides of buildings| which was slightly different than marketed. The service was great| and employees were helpful and kind. Our main complaints included uncomfortable mattresses and some pillows that smelled bad!",1
Great hotel. Friendly & helpful staff especially front desk & valet parking. We stayed while taking kids to see sights in NYC. It was perfect hotel for what we were looking for! Nice to have free breakfast when traveling in NYC with teenage boys who love to eat!,1
Very comfortable stay! Clean and updated room and bathroom. Loved the pillows| after touristy things in NYC aching feet found a good nights rest.Smiling cleaning staff at breakfast tables. Thanks guys!,1
The rooms were small| but nice. The breakfast was wonderful.,1
The staff was friendly and the rooms were clean. The hotel is conveniently located. My only quibble would be the breakfast| but it's free so I really can't complain.,1
Excellent service| outstanding desk clerks| especially Emmanuel| who was very helpful to us! Will definitely stay there again when we return to NYC!,1
Staff was amazing - really committed to making our stay enjoyable. A special shout out to Luis| Benson and Geraldine| all of whom were so friendly and helpful. Check in and out was smooth and breakfast options were varied and well-prepared. We're planning to stay there again on our next trip to the city. Well done!,1
It was amazing.,1
Great location! Just a couple blocks from Times Square| quick walk from a less busy street. Very clean. Amazing breakfast bar! Staff very friendly. Great concierge service and knowledge of area. My only complaint is the full size bed‚Äîa little tight for two adults.,1
It was amazing and excellent customer service!!!,1
Concierge was very helpful and had a great personality. Would have liked to have a scanner to send important paper for work. Very busy and had to wait for elevators. Breakfast was great.,1
Only bad thing was the breakfast. It was free| but mediocre. The coffee was decent,1
We enjoyed our stay and the location was very convenient. Close to times square area and also to the subway.,1
Room is minimal| but it is in the heart of Manhattan.,1
Great central location!  Nice rooms. Right next to subway. Easy trek to many sights by foot. McDonalds across the street for kids. Everyone is super friendly and helpful!  Very caring people here!,1
It is well located near all tourist spots. Rooms were clean with good view.,1
Great location and very helpful and friendly staff.,1
Great location.The only problem as usual are other rude guests. The hotel doors are very heavy which I guess is to make them secure. The problem is if you do not hold the door it will SLAM. So imagine every inconsiderate guest not holding their door and just letting it slam repeatedly at all hours.This is not the hotels fault. Just rude guests.,1
This hotel is in a wonderful location| between Port Authority and Times Square. It's very easy to drive to from Lincoln Tunnel| and valet parking makes it even easier.  There's an extremely kind staff from the desk  to the breakfast buffet. It's definitely a NYC favorite of mine.,1
Central location| great breakfast| cleanliness and great staff.,1
My stay was GREAT!! My only complaint would be the Wi-Fi availability....that was WACK & the Breakfast was an abomination to say the least. Everyrhing else was SUPERB.,1
The room was fantastic! Very clean and the most comfortable bed. We were so impressed with the location and the service. The only thing is that there aren't enough elevators and you can wait a bit during busy times| but it's very minor. Also| parking was quite the expense| but at least it was no-hassle valet!,1
Very nice people everyone was very helpful. Location is good short walk to Times Square.,1
Even concierge was very helpful,1
The property was very accessible. It's also clean.,1
The hotel located just right at Time Square. Easy to access to metro| stores and restaurants. It was my first time in NYC| there were a lot of places for me to see. After an all day walk| I came back to the hotel for a break before I headed out to time square enjoy the view| the crowd and explore the restaurants.The hotel was very comfy and clean. The free breakfast was wonderful. Overall I'm very satisfied with the hotel.,1
My wife said it was nice place and friendly staff and good location.,1
Benson was awesome- extremely friendly and helpful when looking for a table at breakfast. Breakfast area was small and crowded for the number of guests. Staff was friendly| hotel pretty good aside from the crowding.,1
There for Road Scholar class| stayed after. Great location| pleasant staff| breakfast a bit crowded,1
Our stay at the Hampton Inn Times Square was great.  It is in a perfect location to everything we were going to do.  The subway station was only minutes away| close and convenient.  The front desk staff and the help desk were friendly and helpful.  The room was tiny but clean and the bedding comfortable. Starting your day with a good breakfast is also a plus. We would definitely stay here again and tell our friends to stay here too. Thank you Hampton Inn for making our trip to NYC a pleasant one.,1
Honestly the best stays! Hampton inn service and hospitality in the New York location was the best!,1
We had a great time . The hotel staff was extremely nice & very helpful. The breakfast room was pretty descent size & staff was always smiling & refilling things. Courtesy desk was amazing. Loved my morning coffee!!,1
For as busy as NYC is the hotel staff here were superb. They went above and beyond when it came to assisting us| keeping us in the loop of all we needed to know and extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Considering the reputation that New Yorkers can have...the staff at The Hampton In. Times Sq Central were anything but that. I highly recommend them| you won't regret it!  These folks love what they do and it truly showed. I will definitely be staying here in the future!!!  Special thanks to Lilly for all of her assistance| guidance and help!,1
Area was great friendly staff valet excellent breakfast good rooms clean,1
Great location!  Staff was very helpful!  We visited NYU and Columbia| both were just 15-20 minute train ride away!,1
A little pricey for room but that's manhattan!,1
My stay was just what I was looking for; a professional and friendly staffed hotel located block away from manhattan's buzzing activities and transportation| clean environment and rooms| cozy and comfy. I was very satisfied.,1
Great for Times Square. Staff really helpful and full of information to help you get around.,1
The staffs are friendly and the to go bags are nice and convenient.,1
Wonderful location.   Great breakfast.    Great rooms.  Very impressed with their free roof top observation area.,1
Great location| next to the subway,1
Excellent location| nice variety of food at buffet| very nice staff.,1
Staff were great room was spotless breakfast very good also.,1
I liked the location in the Theatre District and proximity to Times Square. Room was clean. Good shower. Nice bed. Downside was that the room doors slam shut and I was disturbed by everyone nearby on my floor coming in/out. Doors need a damper/swing arm on them so they shut quietly.,1
It was nice being close to Times Square in a comfortable room.,1
Everybody was friendly location was great rooms are clean we have no complaints at all,1
I read about the place but it's wasn't what I thought|our room was ok| breakfast plenty but not a variation|the staff very good and location too| nothing exciting any way it's NYC.,1
Very happy with our stay! The staff were super friendly and accommodating. Breakfast was fabulous!,1
Very close to everything. Not much to complain about. Breakfast was good. Staff helpful.,1
Liked location| can drop off bags if room not ready| staff friendly and helpful and am breakfast.,1
Everything was very good| the emplacement was great|  close to Time Sqare| restaurants .,1
Front desk staff was attentive and helpful| and I didn't need to speak to anyone again for the duration of my stay.,1
Everything was great. Staff friendly and accomodating,1
Enjoyed the hotel. Great that they had free wifi and breakfast! Awful beds/pillows. I managed but I woke up alot due to those conditions. Overall| great experience for the price!,1
I found the service amazing in NYC this is so rare! My flight arrived early and the front desk allowed a little early check-in I was exhausted so this was definitely appreciated. Rooms are typically small in the city but the hotel made up for it by spaciousness|cleanliness|style and comfort.,1
Hotel is located in a great location. Will def visit again. I travel a lot and this has been the best hotel I've visited in the US.,1
I can't say enough nice things about this place. Everyone went out of their way to be helpful. Breakfast each day was wonderful. Check in and checkout were easy. Warm cookies each evening were welcoming snd it was extremely helpful to have a place to keep our luggage past check out on our last day.,1
I arrived in NYC at 5:45 AM| and the hotel let me check in right away.  The on-site breakfast provided a variety of options| and the staff kept the breakfast room clean and tidy.,1
Great hotel in great location.,1
Comfortable beds| good breakfast.Did not like that elevators take too long and are always busy,1
Location and service were great,1
Very friendly staff...everyone from the front lobby| concierge to attendant in breakfast to housekeeping. Delicious breakfast ever morning| even provided breakfast to go when we were in a hurry.,1
Location was amazing. All staff were courteous and quick to help with everything. Was able to get early check-in. Loved that.,1
Great location for plays and Times Square. Room was a great price for the area. Surprisingly quiet. Awesome staff ready to help and make you feel comfortable. Breakfast free and tastes great,1
We took a train into the city for dinner and a show.  Hotel was easy walking distance between Grand Central Station and the theater district.  We had a city view on a high floor that was wonderful even when it was snowing.  Would definitely stay here again.  The woman at the front desk was super friendly and helpful.,1
The property was very clean and the staff is super friendly! The room was updated and nice. The breakfast had a lot of variety and very good.,1
Would like on-site bar and restaurant. Larger breakfast area.,1
A+ on the staff.Everyone was welcoming and helpful. Excellent.The elevators were very challenging. They are inadequate for the peak loads.The breakfast needs some more whole grain low sugar options like nuts without sugar (the sliced almonds were good for the oatmeal| but would have been better without sugar). I appreciated the ability to turn off the room fan| but the bathroom fan was pretty noisy.Overall a good stay. Thanks|,1
The included breakfast had a great variety| and warm chocolate chip cookies appeared at the front desk occasionally.  Wish we had a fridge on our room,1
Great location.  Cant fault the staff.  Breakfast ok| very busy and chaotic after 8am.,1
The room was pretty roomy compared to other hotels.,1
I log dozens of room nights in hotels in a year| and it's this sort of personal attention that makes me want to return again and again. Hampton Inn Times Square Central will be the first place I check when I'm booking future NYC trips. Thanks again!,1
A great hotel which ticked all our boxes for our trip- fantastic staff| breakfast included| good location. Our children loved the free cookies in the lobby each evening from 5pm| whilst myself and my wife enjoyed the free beverage station. It was great to come back into the lobby and make a cup of coffee after a long day of sightseeing in the cold. We also thought it was great that reception offered free bottles of water to guests| I'd stay again in the blink of an eye. A great choice for families.,1
Great location; very friendly and accommodating staff| nice room.  Would definitely stay here again!,1
provision of free breakfast| teas| coffees|water etc was great. Loved that the hotel also provided free snack packs for you to take out and that warm cookies were  available on your return to the hotel. The room was very quiet and clean. The beds were super comfy. Staff|especially Geraldine were very friendly and helpful.  Location was perfect.,1
Clean and new hotel.  Great lobby.  Extremely friendly and helpful staff.,1
Perfect location| great breakfast,1
Hotel is very good ! Cheap and good ! Free breakfast for all guest !,1
The staff at breakfast was amazing! Especially Darren| he was friendly and accommodating.  Excellent job!,1
Very friendly and helpful staff including the housekeepers| the man helping people in the breakfast room| the front desk people| and the concierges.My only complaint - the breakfast room was too small. Often no seating available during most popular times.,1
I didn't like that this hotel had no parking and than wanted to charge 58 a day just to park when people already having to pay for a room and other things,1
We stayed Feb. 9 - 12| 2019 and the Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central exceeded our expectations!  The location is absolutely perfect!  You are surrounded by Broadway theaters| Times Square one block to the right| restaurant row one block to the left| and anything else you need all around; it just doesn't get better than that! The room was clean and fresh| the heating/air-conditioning worked perfectly| the bathroom was clean and bright (even the tile)| the bed was comfy| the bed linens were nice and the pillows gave plenty of choices to suit a variety of preferences. The breakfast was delicious and a great start to our days!  The service with a smile was prompt| courteous| and the bellman Luis Luna went above and beyond.  It was raining on our last day and he lent us umbrellas to use!  He held our luggage for us on check-out day| hailed the cab and loaded the luggage for us.  We had great conversations each time we passed through the lobby and needed something. Top Notch service! I would not hesitate to stay here again. Thank you for a great stay Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central!,1
Great area| nice lobby and rooms| clean. Good breakfast area. Friendly staff. Would stay there again. Great view.,1
What stood out was the friendliness of your staff.Everyone made y li u feel like you were at home. John the Concierge got us Awesome tickets to see Wicked but it's his personality that stood out!,1
Great location. My gf and I came to NYC to see the Westminster Dog Show at MSG. My gf had never stayed overnight in the City| so I also wanted to show her some of the many sites.  It was very easy to explore the City using the hotel's central location. as our ‚Äúhome base.‚Äù  Also| the breakfast was great. Very convenient.,1
Very good location. Great free breakfast and friendly staff. Room clean and shiwer and bathroom great. They offer hot cocoa | coffe| tea and warm cookies the whole day. Love it!! Great place . Thank you,1
This property was centrally located to everything we wanted to see. The room was clean| the staff was friendly and helpful| and the breakfast was decent.,1
Location was great.  Staff were helpful.  3 elevators one was down for the three days we were there.  Breakfast was good.,1
It was really great arriving early morning and having a room already available for me.  Awesome.  Front desk staff helpful and breakfast staff worked hard & cleaned tables really well. Attention to detail!  Well done!,1
The tea in the lobby was wonderful to have after coming in from the cold evening.  I recommend leaving the bars of soap in the shower and by the sink instead of taking them.  It felt so wasteful to open a new soap every day for the shower and the sink.,1
We arrived 3 hours early to drop off luggage and the clerk told us our room was available. It was amazing being that we had our 4 year old son with us and needed to rest a bit. Great service. Super clean. Excellent all around,1
Great service and location. I highly recommend this hotel!,1
We loved our stay! Breakfast was a little crowded| but we were able to find a spot to sit. I loved being surrounded by many languages. Service was great! Hotel was clean and nice. Great location to subway entrances and Times Square!,1
Everything about this hotel was phenomenal.  We requested an early check in| but since it couldn't be accommodated they gladly stored our luggage. None of our bags were locked and everything was safe.  We had a city view on the 27th floor and the view was spectacular.  Two double beds were very comfortable and the room was spacious and quiet.  The hotel was located right near the Port Authority and in the heart of Times Square so very| very convenient.  The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating.  Breakfast on Sunday morning was delicious. Breakfast included eggs| sausage| oatmeal| pancakes| waffles| fruit| yogurt| bagels| toast| coffee| water| juices plus more. Overall a great experience. We will be returning and I highly recommend it.,1
Great location| frienly service great breakfastfor New York...Room was clean,1
Excellent! Super spacious and clean!  Close to everything. Front desk staff superb. Will definitely return again| can't say enough good things about our experience.,1
This was a short notice stay for my parents who were returning from a cruise and connecting travel (greyhound) was cancelled due to bad weather on the east coast (Boston). I have to say this hotel & staff are amazing!!! My 96yr old dad had a medical emergency just before leaving the ship resulting in a visit to the ER... We were reassured that the room would be available whenever they got there and then they were able to extend their stay an additional day on short notice at the same initial agreed rate!!! They get and Outstanding rating from Us!!!,1
Great location| love that breakfast and coffee are included too. The room was modern and clean-will stay here again!,1
Unfortunately our trip was short due to the need for me to return to work. I was very impressed with the location and the front desk personnel. There were two ladies in particular that were great Christina and I forget the second name. They were both on the desk 1/19/19,1
Great location. Good breakfast. Very clean and comfortable. Only down side was the lomg wait for the elevators.,1
The property was clean and spacious| and the staff was incredibly helpful and friendly. Olivia checked us in at the front desk and couldn't have been nicer or more welcoming!,1
Location of property is good.Clean aspect of property is goodDecoration of hotel is good.,1
The service is amazing everyone is so friendly and fun. The free breakfast is really good and the location is fantastic| literally a 30 second walk and your in timesquare. The rooms are a great size and we had a nice view. And the hotel bakes fresh cookies everyday at 5 pm| that are better than cookies I bought from the magnolia bakery in New York. Highly recommend staying here and will definitely stay here again.,1
Fabulous location right off Time Square. Can walk to everything. Staff was friendly and helpful with suggestions for shows| tickets| meals. Room was small but it is NY after all and we were fine with 2 adults and 1 child. Updated bathroom and was very quiet; never heard the elevator or other guests while there and hardly heard sirens. Breakfast was pretty good for a free meal.,1
Excellent customer service| clean updated Hotel with Modern amenities| Free Breakfast|| Nice Friendly Staff.,1
A top hotel. It was clean| warm and friendly. The staff were very helpful and were genuine in their service|nothing was to much trouble. Breakfast was great and saved us at least an hour each day. Check in and out was very well handled and fast.   The location was brilliant close to times square but away from the crowds. Free tea and coffee in the reception was much appreciated. The reception staff were knowledgeable about the surrounding area and again were very pleasant giving advice. The hotel was always being cleaned and polished. Safe deposit box in each room was useful.I have already recommended this hotel to others.,1
No issues. We had an amazing time in the city,1
We only stayed one night but the short time we did stay| we absolutely loved it. It was right off Time Square and very convenient to where we wanted to be. Also| my son left his laptop in the room after we checked out. Later on in the day I got a text from them letting me know that they had his computer and were holding it for us. We would definitely return back to this hotel. Yes| it was crowded because it was during the Christmas holidays| but we went knowing it would be.,1
Perfect! All the staff are so friendly. The place is clean. And all the things of Times Square really are so close,1
A great value hotel in a good location for Times Square. The hotel staff were all dedicated to service - in particular the breakfast staff. I would definitely say this is a good value hotel.,1
Great staff| very pleasant and helpful. Room was very clean and breakfast was incredible.,1
Small| but clean and updated. No water or frig in room| which would have made it nicer.,1
Luis in the reception area was very good. Luis thanks for the service.,1
We had a great time. My very favorite hotel out of the ones I've stayed in. This will be our hone away from hone hotel in NYC,1
Great rates,1
The hotel is located in a great location in Times Square. Staff were friendly and the breakfast adequate. Would definitely stay again.,1
Great but need better pillows,1
Great location.  Definitely recommend staying here.,1
Great location| great staff| great first visit to NYC!,1
Location was great! Couple of blocks from Times Square. Staff was very friendly and helpful!,1
Everything from start to finish was pretty near perfect. The hotel was wonderful and all the staff there were just as good and very helpful... we would definatly stay there again.,1
Location is excellent for Christmas activities. Super friendly and helpful staff.  Could not beat the price. We paid 150 which included tax for a one night stay on a Friday night through expedia.  Breakfast was ok. I would highly recommend.,1
Great place to stay in Times Square.  Small but comfy and staff are quite friendly and helpful.,1
From the maid service| breakfast room| and main desk| everyone was friendly and very helpful. Benson was super in the breakfast room.,1
Free breakfast and nice front desk people- they were very helpful,1
Hotel staff was so friendly! Hotel in a great location...would definitely stay here again. Rest breakfast as well as hot beverages in lobby all day long. And cookies in the evening. :-),1
Situated in an ideal location!  A major subway stop directly across the street. Just blocks from Times Square| Broadway theaters| and some wonderful restaurants (both national chains and unique local ones). The hotel staff was always very polite and helpful. Check-in and check-out was a breeze. Complimentary breakfast had many tasty choices| plus fruit to take and enjoy during the day. Bottled water was available at the front desk when needed.  After a long day of sightseeing and evening activities| the complimentary tea| coffee and sometimes even a cookie were offered as a late night treat. I highly recommend trying this hotel.  It made a great impression on an out-of-towner like myself.,1
Great location. Beds comfortable. Breakfast was nice bonus as was free WiFi. Staff was very courteous.,1
Very nice hotel| the staff was very friendly and helpful| the location was perfect.,1
The location was perfect| right in the middle of everything. The room itself was what we expected for NY. Not much room| the sliding door for a bathroom was not ideal. You could hear everything! But the extra touches they try to make for comfort was nice. Complimentary Hot chocolate/tea/coffee on the main level was nice to have with the cool weather. The breakfast also has a very nice selection. Overall my sister and I would definitely choose this hotel again. In fact we ended up here because our first pick was awful!,1
Had a great time. Friendly staff and perfect location.,1
Great location| would stay here again for sure| nicest people and very helpful. Don't worry if you are Late for breakfast they'd will make sure you don't go hungry,1
Complimentary beverages in lobby| complimentary breakfast.Location was wonderful close to subway and bus station.Staff was very friendly. Room clean| I loved staying here,1
A very nice service| quick check in process and I can go to my room earlier...thank you.,1
Location was great for what we wanted to see.  Staff was vert friendly & helpful.,1
Decided to go last minute. Glad we stayed .,1
The Hampton Inn was a great find in the heart of all the holiday action. Located just a few blocks away from Bryant Park| Times Square and more it's a great location for a quick in and out of the city.,1
Horrible costumer service ever. They don't care about costumer,0
Excellent  Location. Cleanliness was on par. Breakfast was always to find  seats..so head on down  early...the left elevator was a mystery as it skips most floors ...,1
Great location and pretty good sized rooms.  Only challenge was that there was often a pretty long wait for the elevators at peak times.,1
The staff was gracious and accommodating I love the fact that the hotel is convenient to all the attractions,1
The hotel its really confortable and clean. Great customer service. Excellent location,1
Great location.  Great customer service.  Great tea/hot chocolate bar to warm you up on cold winter days.,1
Location excellent| breakfast excellent| rooms could have been a little cleaner upon arrival| housekeeping after first day way excellent,1
I like that I can leave my bags if I get in before check in time or leave them after check out time while awaiting transportation.,1
So clean and wonderful amenities! Staff is friendly and location is excellent!,1
Great place to stay| good quality room| breakfast was delicious and very central location for getting around.,1
Hotel was perfect close to everything the staff couldn't do enough for you. Highly recommend,1
went for a girls' overnight to sightsee and see Broadway play.  I picked this hotel because of the great location and free breakfast.,1
The hotel is close to where I work so it's convenient.,1
Terrific location between 7th and 8th Ave| and less than 100 feet from the subway.  On-site breakfast is a plus.  Every single staff person| from Front Desk| to Housekeeping| to Breakfast stockers| was friendly| helpful| and professional.  WiFi is good| phone service (Cricket Wireless) was sketchy in the room| but OK in the lobby.  It's a good value for a trip to NYC.,1
Location| convient| clean and room very clean and spacious| stuff very friendly and very helpful,1
Extremely friendly staff . Clean property. Needs more elevators and small restaurant. Really close to center  of  Times Square.,1
Excellent.Highly recommended.Enjoyed the buffet breakfast.,1
The  personal in the reception area definitely need more training. In the checking process the representative told us that we did not  have a reservation with the hotel. We had to insist and she finally found our reservation. Very bad experience. Later I requested 1 bottle of water and he gave it  to me with a nasty actitud.,1
Loved the location and the breakfasts are the real deal!,1
We found all the staff very nice and helpful. The free bottles of water and coffee in reception was great after a day out. We were there for 6 nights| the room was ok for the 4 of us. There is not enough storage in the room for 4 people. The location is excellent| near the subway and time square,1
Great location but linens not up to Hampton Inn standards. The comforter was lumpy and it's cover snagged.,1
Great location and service,1
Great time overall | very clean| fast check in| I literally booked and checked in in the same hour. Very nice staff as well,1
No hotel amenities other than free breakfast. Hotel was not worth the room price. Definitely needs some upgrades.  No frig. Furniture old. Location great. Customer service great.,0
Amazing Hotel| room very comfortable| hot breakfast was simple but awesome| centrally located to restaurants and the subway,1
Only complaint for us were the pillows and mattress wasn't the most comfortable. All the pros out way that one con. Clean| updated| very helpful & friendly staff and convenient location! Using the valet parking... We did get a small ding in the door of our vehicle| but that's to be expected in NYC!,1
IT was a convenient location and very nice.  breakfast was typical Hampton.  Okay.,1
Pretty good| nothing special but no real complaints. It was clean| and it had everything advertised. The only issue is that the elevators were very disorganized - an elevator took several minutes to come| and they were small so not many people could fit. Often we would have to wait for 2-3 elevators before we could get on.,1
We enjoyed our stay here. The staff was friendly and professional.  The complimentary breakfast was good but very busy ( will arrive earlier next time).  Hotel is very close to Port Authority Bus Terminal which is how we arrived.  Great location close to Times Square and walking distance to Madison Square Garden. Room was clean and comfortable.,1
Every thing was perfect| ecxellent service and very frendly team| super clean and perfect location with a very good breakfast.,1
The Hampton Inn at Times Square was a great location for theatres| restaurants| and shopping. A lot of sites are easily walkable from the hotel. The breakfast is great too| and the staff was very friendly and helpful.,1
Friendly| clean| comfortable and well located.,1
My only complaint about this hotel is the slow elevator service/availability during peak times.,1
Very enjoyable stay. Excellent location. Perfect location for exploring NY. The only real complaint| is that the breakfast needs improvement!,1
Awesome staff.  Great location,1
Excellent location| great services and amenities!,1
Location great and the staff was very friendly and helpful,1
Fantastic location!!! We walked everywhere we needed to go other than a couple of subway treks just for the experience. Granted| we walk all the time (and run all the time) so it was no problem for us. We were just a couple of blocks away from Times Square. Food everywhere - just an awesome location. Room was a bit small - ended up having to put suit cases on the A/C unit| restroom was tiny... But we made the best of it.,1
The rooms and common areas were clean and well maintained.  Service was great.  Appreciated the free breakfast as well as grab-and-go bags.  Good location too.,1
great location. In the heart of times square. plenty of things to do within walking distance.,1
The second time I checked in in this hotel. Always satisfied.,1
"Thank you to Farrell at the front desk and the housekeeping staff for having our room ready early when we arrived! The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The breakfast was great as well as the little touches such as the ""to go"" bags in the morning and snack at night. The location was perfect to Times Square and all the attractions. We did struggle a bit with the WiFi connection",1
It was a nice place to stay and was close to Times Square. Best feature for them to sell single beer bottles and other snacks.,1
Just returned after a week in this excellent very well located hotel. It was our first visit to New York and we couldn't have picked a better place to stay for its very convenient location to Broadway and Times Square to name just two. The room was very comfortable as was the bathroom and well equipped with everything you could need. The Buffet breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice and very well laid out. I'd like to give a special mention to the Breakfast Supervisor- Geraldine Meehan who really looked after us all week| 'thank you' Geraldine you are a lovely lady. All other members of staff were very friendly and helpful too . We will definitely stay here again .,1
temperature control in the room was excellent! Be cautious of noisy neighbors as the walls are thin. However| when we called the front desk to complain about the noise they took care of it right away. Great location to the theater district and midtown restaurants.,1
The breakfast is extremely crowded with not enough seating. The location is great and the hotel was nice. We would have preferred to have a bathroom door that could be closed instead of a sliding door.,1
The valet parking attendant was excellent.  Honestly| all of the service staff were wonderful.  I would definitely stay again at this hotel.,1
This hotel is great--it has a fantastic location| it's new and clean| and the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. The only problem I had was with the elevators. Several times when I tried to use the elevator| I would wait quite a long time for it to arrive and when it did| it would be so packed with people that there wasn't room for me. I would wait a while for the next one but it would be the same thing. However| this was a small problem considering all the other benefits of the hotel| especially for such a great price.,1
Olivia (front Desk) and Geraldine (Breakfast Supervisor)  were exceptional friendly and very personable.  It really made for a great stay!,1
Perfect location near Time Square and Theater District|  Modern clean| quiet room.  Expansive free breakfast.  Perfect!!,1
It was very good experience  looking forward for another visit,1
Excellent hotel.  Great location.   Good breakfast.,1
We stayed for a weekend.  The facility is clean and well-kept.  The staff are friendly| helpful and professional.  They go out of their way to be sure your stay is pleasant.,1
The Hampton was great for a couple room could if been bigger. No shower I would of loved to come back from all that sightseeing and taken a hot bubble bath. But in all close to everything which gets an A+ from me.. You can walk where to whatever you want to see..,1
Easy walk to theater district and local attractions. Have stayed here several times and been pleased.,1
The room was good| the bathroom great and the lobby was a great place to come back to after a long day of walking.,1
Great location but elevators woefully inefficient and not enough breakfast space.  Staff was pleasant.Get a low floor if you stay here!,1
The check-in was delayed| but I'm glad I waited because our room was on a high floor and away from the elevator. It was so quiet considering it was in the middle of all the theaters. The great location allowed us to walk to most of our weekend activities.,1
me to check in earlier than 3pm- Room and bathroom was good| breakfast too! I love that the lobby was a place where guests could relax. Location was excellent!,1
The hotel was great|convenient|friendly environment| and good free breakfast!will stay there again if the price is right .!,1
Amazing & great location...,1
A fantastic hotel| right in the heart of time square.  Staff were extremely helpful and friendly.  Rooms very clean.  Only criticism a little unorganised around breakfast.,1
Perfect location! Great valet parking at reasonable price. Very clean. Free breakfast!,1
great location   Crowded breakfasts  quiet roomrooftop viewing,1
It was great went and saw a play dinner,1
Clean| comfortable and conveniently located in the heart of Manhattan. King bed with a city view was a treat and the wonderful Service| Wi-Fi| USA Today| bottled water and breakfast buffet with a variety of great options were all bonuses. Recommend!,1
The staffs were very nice and helpful. They offered to keep our bags so we could tour the city| which was a big deal for me. Definitely going back there üëç,1
Raquelle was rough every time we ask for something,1
Nice place and excellent location| we enjoy our stay,1
Good hotel. Perfect location. Good breakfast. Good service.,1
The most convenience hotel in my life. We could use all kinds of subway very easily(in 3min!!) and nice breakfast. I strongly recommend this hotel to everyone,1
Well located| close to main touristic places and different subway stations| shopping and restaurants. They have breakfast included but it is very crowded and not the best quality.,1
Nice and clean room near Time Sq.I strongly recommend the hotel. I have been there a couple of times.,1
Good place and comfortable. Nice experience!,1
Excellent staff| breakfast very complete| clean bedrooms! I would definitely stay at the Hampton's again!!,1
Just a few steps to the Times Square. Clean and silent rooms | comfortable beds and nicest staff. Thanks to all..,1
Good!                             Gr Harm         Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,1
Good hotel. Clean and kind. Breakfast is so so.,1
Hello i  have an hotel.  Com rewards card for traveling  and when im in New York  this is the hotel to book embassy nice  clean and near by location for food and shopping  great stay what more can i say!,1
Location is excellent. What I didn't like| no drinking water available in the room and at the lobby the price of drinking water was too much!,1
The breakfast included was amazing| our room had a good view of the city and the hallway to our room had an amazing view of the empire state building,1
Great location| good service.The problem was in breakfast/dining area is very very crowded.,1
We stayed for the weekend. This place is great. Nice size room for NYC| very comfortable beds| good size bathroom. Breakfast was delicious| lots of choices| but super crowded| small space. They were offering free sodas and waters in the lobby throughout our stay. Not sure if that is an every day thing. I will definitely stay here again anytime I visit NYC. Great for families| sofa bed was big and comfy for our eight year old.,1
We called down the 2nd day we were there to get the room cleaned| no one came. The next day| the room attendant came at 6:00pm???? We were in the room & told her to come back at 6:30. She never came back. Next day was the same thing. We stayed 4 nights & never got the room cleaned. If we complained the first day| then send someone out ASAP the next day| why wait until 6:00 pm??!! Also| another issue is way too many people at breakfast!! You can't enjoy your food| or you have to go back to the room to eat| which the elevators take too long. Also| keep the restrooms off the front desk stocked| I had to ask for toilet paper twice. Sorry to say| not impressed with this Embassy Suites. No manager reception either| but it says it's an amenity on your website. I was quite shocked about that. Oh well| my stay was a one and done| never again at this hotel.,0
Great location| excellent breakfast despite crowded conditions| nice but tiny room| curteous staff. I highly recommend it for a couple but the room wouldn't fit a larger family.,1
This property is in the best position ever| everything near to you| you can walk everywhere from here| of course if you want to know better manhattan you need to walk..,1
Great location. Large variety at breakfast. Room set up great for my family( we had the king suite w sofa division). Outdoor sky lawn great little area.,1
The check-in process took almost an hour in line. The rooms were not ready. When we finally get the room after traveling all day there were no towels until the next day. Even have to go to the front desk to ask because the guest service line never answered our calls. In top of that one night the fire alarm went off waking all guests at 6am. I will never stay in that place and I don't recommend it.,0
It was the worst experience I ever had with hotels. When we arrived after hours of driving| we were told that no rooms were available. However| I had already payed for 2 nights. We got sent to another hotel but it was significantly worse in quality. The room we got was nothing compared to what I had reserved. It was a lot smaller in size and it didn't even have a balcony.,0
This hotel charged me more than what I bought. They said that was a fee that they never mentioned in the price. I'm so angry with it.,0
"The hotel itself was good| a minor issue in the room as the shower handle had the retainer pieces dislodged and cut my arm.Check in was by far the worst I have experienced.  Arrived at tge hotel early and check in was not available.  That is understandable.  check in time was 4:00PM.  Returned at 4:00 to find a line approximately 50 people to check in and two clercks working.  While telling people there room wasn't ready and may not be until after 8-9:00.  All the time leaving to go somewhere.  At one point all the clercks just left.  After being in line for 2 hours | and next in line.  all the clercks left again.  The manager arrived and was in confrontation with the man in front of me.  I could not believe that the manager actually told him ""What do you want me to do clean your room myself?. I have other people to take care of| not just you."" He obviously canceled and left. So after 21/2 HOURS i finally was able to get to my room.  I will be sending Embassy Suites an email as well.",0
Property was severely understaffed. One young individual was going above and beyond checking folks in. While the other co worker couldn't handle the stress of the process. They claimed lack of housekeeping support. We waited 6 hours to check in. Bathroom was filthy. The lobby bathroom had no toilet paper and the feminine hygiene receptacles hadnt been changed in a while. Rooms were untouched the 3 days we were there.,0
My stay was good hotel location was great| the rooms were clean and comfortable.,1
I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. I'm a New Yorker| so I was prepared for a small room with mediocre cleanliness‚Ä¶ but this hotel is a midtown gem! Modern| clean| and spacious. This is absolutely my nee favorite hotel when I visit home. A GREAT place to stay.,1
Expedia asked what time we would arrive. I said between 1-2. We waited until 5 and gave up. Went to another hotel,0
The location was great to where you needed to be for part of our visit.  However| the fire system was malfunctioning and went off a number of times in the morning.  And| there were a number of announcements detailing the reasons why.,1
Place is really nice and very convenient. Highly recommend.,1
We were very happy with everything at the hotel. Very convenient location| tidy rooms| great breakfast (loved the real eggs :))| good service| all for an extremely reasonable price. I'd stay here again| in a heartbeat.,1
Rooms were not clean| floor was very dirty. No towels in room and had to ask many tim,0
The guys at the front desk were professional| friendly & amazing with answering all our questions. They even call us a taxi to go to the airport. The view from our room was breathtaking| Free breakfast & near to everything! Our experience was amazing!,1
Excellent free hot breakfast.,1
Nice hotel. Not bad Location. Walking distance to time square and Bryant park. We were unable to hangout in the lounge. And you can hear your neighbors they the vents in the bathroom and room. Kinda awkward! Lol! The TV kept glitching. The window only opened a few inches lol! And no fan. A/C was very cold. Food in the area kinda sucked. Taco Bell| dunkN donuts next door| and few others. For the city that never sleeps I wasn't able to order food after 930p for delivery which sucked too. Which the restaurant was open downstairs. Breakfast in the AM wasn't bad. Need togo containers.,1
We had a great time the staff were very helpful and the location was perfect.,1
worst hotel experience.. issue with cleanliness . Sofa bed was damaged due to which one person couldn't sleep all night even when we made reservation for 3 . We specially paid extra amount for late check out on Expedia while reservation but hotel staff did not have any information on it . Expedia charged me full amount for reservation and than hotel also charged my credit card- still trying to sort it out .. not expect this with hotel chain like Hilton..,0
Conveniently located very close to Bryant Park| Macys and Time Square. Plenty of shopping and places to dine close by. Hotel has a very nice buffet style breakfast which will save you a lot of money| would definitely stay again.,1
Awesome experience,1
First time in NYC. Hotel was very accommodating. Great location. Our room was comfortable. Will stay again.,1
The room provided had a great view of the Empire State Building| and lower Manhattan skyline in the distance. The room was mostly clean; the fridge smelled bad and there were random hairs in different parts of the bathroom. One towel was dirty. Staff was great! Front desk was overloaded and had a long line a few times. Free breakfast was nice and met our not-so-high expectations. Location was great for what we needed too. Overall pleasant experience; would stay again if the price is right,1
Very good location.Nice staff,1
Location was very good.$15 per day drinks & snack was handy.Quality of breakfast was good.House services were quick.,1
Our room was so dirty there was dog hair everywhere when we walked in and the pillows and couch pillows had stains and it had a fowl smell to it. Overall it was a horrible experience for the amount of money I paid and I will never be staying here again when I come to New York.,0
Staff was extremely friendly and attentive. Breakfast had a wonderful selection. Rooms however were smaller than advertised on photos. Overall great stay in NYC.,1
Good overall,1
cutest rooms | best location near all my favorite places to eat and shop,1
I like the location of the hotel.,1
Professional and friendly staff| clean rooms| perfect location,1
The staff here was amazing and the view from our hotel room of the Empire State Building! It was breath taking. Definitely considering stying here again in my next NY trip! Walking distance to everything!,1
I had a wonderful solo trip. The location is clean| with specious rooms complete with a microwave and a refrigerator. The location is perfect - Bryant Park| Macy's| The Public Library| Grand Central Station| the Empire State and Chrysler Buildings| and so much more are so close. And the pantry has great snacks! Overall...a great experience.,1
Inexpensive for a Manhattan hotel| but the rooms are a lot smaller and not as impressive as the photos. My wife found the place not as clean as she prefers. Bathroom was nice| location excellent| and breakfast was the usual COVID-era blech (only packaged foods and heavy on the carbs). Still| value for money,1
Great stay! Around the corner from Empire State Building and Macy's. 7 minutes walk to Times Square. Quiet and safe| clean and well lit!,1
The property was clean and staff were nice.,1
Great hotel Great location ......................ba,1
Vey clean room| great mattress and pillows and an amazing view of the area!,1
Awesome view from the room| very helpful staff and very neat n clean rooms,1
I booked a spacious studio| with amenities such as personalized robes  upon arrival our room was changed to a smaller room| with no amenities| rooms are extremely small| bathroom door was very heavy to close| refrigerator didn't work| so everything placed in it had spoiled| floors were very dirty| had to throw socks in trash at checkout. Would not stay here again nor would I recommend.,0
Excellent service and friendly staff. 15 USD credit each day to use for drinks and snacks etc. Breakfast bag to go.,1
Excellent location very clean| employees friendly .,1
Not like I loved everything about the property| the room the staff it's a must again...Thank you,1
Very nice property. Employees are great. Great Customer Service.,1
The room was small but the balcony made up for it,1
Room had hair on the floor| wasn't properly cleaned prior to check in..close to touristy area if you're into that but I'm not so I didn't like it.,0
Staff was excellent. Also| the location is very good within a walking distance to many places of interest,1
Amazing location. Clean and friendly staff. Nice breakfast and lounge area. Would stay there again.,1
I super recommend it and just exceptional I super recommend it and just exceptional,1
Very nice hotel. Rooms are small for. Embassy suites- but big for New York standards.  Location was great for us and we loved walking up to time square and theaters each day. Evening reception was always great- although there was not enough seating over the weekend. Service was very good and we would stay here again for sure!,1
Great place to stay in the city. It was very clean and had great service. The place is close to everything in the city.,1
Excellent service. They let us do earlier check in. Check in time is at 4pm and we did it at 10am. This was impressive. Nice hotel| good location. We also got $25 credit to use in the hotel for each room| which we expand all in the bar. I would definitely stay there again.,1
Front desk and check-in very accommodating.  Room a little on small side| but comfortable and it is nyc.  Breakfast very good and we arrived at a good time as it got very crowded.  Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.,1
Nice clean room. Decent location but not quite as close to the subway as I'd hoped. Extremely friendly staff!,1
Our February vacation was awesome in NYC; we enjoy this property so much| we decided to stay one more day!! The check-in was quick| very professional and informative. Room-service was prompt and professional! (the sweet-chili wings are out of this world!!) Our room was spacious| clean| very comfortable| excellent view of the Empire State Building and West 37th street! Breakfast is EXCELLENT| they have a cooked to order station available for omelettes| eggs-your way!! There are 4-5 hot items available| differ from day to day. Oatmeal is a favorite of mine! There is cut-fresh fruit and yogurt available. Choice of juices| coffee and tea available. FYI! The later in the breakfast shift you go: the more crowded the breakfast room become!! A little overwhelming! Also| the elevators for a 39 floor hotel property (YUP-39) get pretty congested and slowed down| during heavy breakfast goer traffic! We took the stairs| since we went to breakfast toward the end of breakfast time.  But when we had gone early| the elevators were smooth sailing!! This hotel is an awesome property| excellent location; literally 12 minute walk to Times Square| Central Park was a 10 minute ride + 8 minute walk to Central Park and Zoo. I recommend this hotel 150%| as a guest service supervisor of a hotel in downtown Back Bay Boston| Massachusetts and hotel/restaurant management degree; I can assure you this property is worth it! You will not be disappointed! Take my word. üëåüíØ üè®,1
I liked the front desk service but don't like that they didn't clean my room. I stayed there for four nights but no one come to clean our room.,1
Great place| great location. The only complaints I have is some of the electrical outlets didn't work and the bathroom sink very slowly.,1
Just superb.  Every detail| cleanliness| breakfast| other food| drinks reception| location| value for money.,1
Location was great. Staff very helpful and receptive.,1
The close proximity to Times Square was convenient.  Staff was extremely friendly and accommodating.,1
There wasn't a single thing that I didn't like about this stay. The staff was extremely helpful and efficient in checking us in and out. The included breakfast was amazing and offered a variety of options. Housekeeping ensured that our room was left spotless daily. Overall| I would definitely stay here again.,1
The breakfast buffet is great| not to be missed!Staff was frienbdly and helpful. Special praise to Kareem| from the nigh shift| who helped us at 4AM with a big | helpful smile!,1
Very close to Times Square. Very clean hotel the staff is awesome.,1
Congrats to all the staff in the breakfast room! Amazing job! Loved the fact that the property is green oriented and it gave the option to refuse house cleaning for the short period that I stayed with them! Good bed and quiet room! Great location!,1
1) overall great hotel 2) Complimentary breakfast with omelette  station was appreciated !,1
Good value for money if needing to stay in New York in January.,1
My wife and i thought that the the bar staff at the heist bar were great| particularly Tom. Only negatives were the lacknof extraction fans in bathroom and the very loud locks on room doors.,1
Very good| clean| good fast breakfast. Great location,1
Great hotel|Loved the breakfast and manager's reception.,1
The hotel was okay the room service didn't change the bed sheets even though they made the bed| the the hotel charged me an extra $25 dollars a day on top of the price Hotel.com quoted me,0
Overall a great experience. Friendly staff|cleanliness|great breakfast|clean and comfortable rooms,1
Great people and a great location. Breakfast staff were great| marathon running bartender at night was awesome!,1
Stayed just after NYE 2020. We had to book two rooms since we were a family of 5. This hotel is not like other Embassy Suites - the rooms are NYC sized - which means small. And it was not a real suite| but the back of the sofa bed made a pseudo internal wall-like barrier but not private by any means. They did not have a 5 person room available for us - so we had to pay essentially double to stay. Lots of hallway to get to sleeping space - and interior doors between room opened to block the hallway so that was basically non-functional. Windows actually opened about 4 inches - which was nice. Rooms were quiet. Bathrooms were surprisingly ok - big enough with good water pressure in the shower. No tub. Clean. Fridge was extra small with no freezer and microwave put the micro in wave - it too was small. But it's NYC so it was probably bigger than lots of apartments. Breakfast was good - although at odd times the line was long and there was way too little room to sit and eat - many people took the food up to their rooms because of this. The manager's reception was ok - snacks varied from pita| pretzels| caprese| chips and salsa - and simple beer and wine. We sat with other people and made for interesting conversations! As for our view| in one room we could see the Empire State Building - the other we could not. Parking was two streets away and $73 a night for our SUV - so just know that too. Midtown is great to walk to ESB| Rockefeller| Library| Grand Central. Stay here was good.,1
Property was close to everything and loved the complimentary breakfast. During peak breakfast time there was nowhere to sit in the dining room so we took our breakfast back to our room.There was also no laundry facilities which was inconvenient.,1
Excellent location!  Clean property! Staff was friendly and helpful.  Nice room sizes and bathrooms!,1
How many very comfortable| very clean and very well located| it is only 5 minutes walk from times square. Lots of dining options around. The reception service is very good and the bar at the entrance is wonderful.,1
Our stay was amazing! The breakfast and happy hour was just delightful| and the staff was so kind and accommodating! Great hotel close to Times Square!,1
I'm frequent embassy suites customer but definitely won't be staying at that property . personnel were helpful,0
Please stay away from his hotel. We were in JFK Airport just landed when we came to know hotel has cancelled the reservation and no one even informed us until after the hotel said they could not accomodate us. The reason given was maintenance issues but I am guessing they had someone ready to pay more for this and just left us without a hotel in the middle of the night at NewYork.,0
Nice place| great location but extremely busy. Its impossible to find place for breakfast between 8.30-10. Other then that| food is fine| egg station and some standard preped food.,1
Stay was great.  Friendly staff and great service overall.,1
Rooms are micro size.  We had one drawer and no closet.  Chair folds out for bed for 3rd person was like a torture device.  Hotel was very clean and staff was excellent| big call out for Tom in the heist bar.  Excellent service.  Location was good.  Room size and lack of true space for free breakfast area was a joke.,0
Absolutely did not like the tiny bathroom| absolutely did not like to have to wait for seating for breakfast and evening reception|  didn't like that room had not been cleaned by 5pm. Did not like that there was no blanket available and was givev a duvet that made me feel even colder. The breakfast and service was excellent.,0
We loved the breakfast & happy hour| the room was very nice| the staff were excellent - especially Pam the night auditor who checked us in on 12/15.My only criticism is that we could not get a room until after 6pm which was very late and inconvenient.,1
Likes: great location| good room size| friendly and helpful staff| breakfast| cocktails in the evening| comfortable beds.Dislikes: a bit of a walk to the nearest subway station| large breakfast crowd after 8:30 (get there early)| TV placement was strange in my room.,1
It is rare that I stay at any Manhattan property and it is clean and everything works (elevator| safe| televisions| etc.).  The staff was courteous and prompt and it is a tremendous service to the guests for the hotel to have a separate service elevator to prevent congestion.,1
Great location in midtown|  2 blocks from the Empire State Building| 7 blocks from Rockefeller center. Breakfast makes it worth the visit| as well as the daily happy hour free cocktail party. Quiet.,1
We are pretty happy with our stay. The location is good| very convenient to explore manhattan. The breakfast is the best thing which almost includes everything you would like to have in the morning.,1
Overall stay was great except the day they did not have any hot water due to a gas issue. Staff apologized and was very friendly,1
The staff went out of their way to help meet our needs and those around us. The room was clean and the complimentary breakfast offered everything imaginable.,1
Nice place! Great location| friendly staff| wouldn't change a thing!,1
This hotel location is great.  Just a few blocks from Bryant park and close enough to Time Square| but away from the excessive noise of that area.  You can walk to Rockefeler center and central park as well as the Empire State Blog| The Vessel| and Chelsea area. With respect to the rooms| I found them of good size for NYC standards| with all amenities needed| including coffee machine| microwave| etc.  Breakfast is included and is good compared to other similar hotels. My only recommendation is| if you do not mind the views| take a low floor because the elevators may get crowded at certain hours and the hotel has 39 floors.  I was on the 6th floor and could use the stairs to the 4th {breakfast} and to the 2nd {gym} without waiting.  In general| I highly recommend this hotel because of location and nice features.,1
Overall it was a very good stay. We had a room with a balcony and our view was the Empire State Building!! Amazing.  My only feedback for improvement would be to have housekeeping be a  bit more detailed in the cleaning.  Overall everything was clean| just small things like the plastic cups were not replaced when used not dusted every day.  But the room was clean| just could have payed more attention to detail.  Worth the money and I would stay there again.,1
Great location| close to everything but not in the super busy spots. Close to the subway| time square| Empire State and lots of shopping.,1
The room did not have enough space for a two people's week long luggage| the breakfast space was congested| most of the time it was to busy to find a seat. The breakfast was also not very good| runny eggs| over cooked potatoes| we were very disappointed in this.,0
Room was not clean|bathroom smelled like mold.Elevators were extremely slow. Breakfast was cold and bland. Staff was rude and dismissive.,0
Issue during check in| asked to step asside and waited over an hour for help. Guy then threw key cards on desk for me| didn't tell me my room number or direct me towards elevator. First time being disappointed with Embassy Suites.,0
Very convenient to many activities in NYC -especially Broadway and restaurants,1
Our stay here has been really amazing . The people here have been so incredible and kind . Would recommend this hotel to anyone .,1
Friendly staff and great room.  Really enjoyed the free breakfast and Happy Hour.,1
What a great place to stay in Manhattan - close to everything one might want to do.  The staff is incredibly friendly and the breakfast is outstanding.  And after a day of viewing the sites| it was awesome to come back to the hotel before dinner and after free drinks and appetizers.  Thanks Embassy Suites for an amazing time in NYC!!,1
Great beds| stylish bathrooms and a good breakfast make this my new favourite hotel in New York.,1
Excellent breakfasts. Bed very comfortable. Clean. Highly recommend.,1
The breakfast and happy hour staff were amazing. They were working so hard| you could tell they enjoyed their job and were happy to work hard. It was a great experience for our family of three with a baby who was just learning to walk.,1
Wonderful breakfast and staff. Love the location.,1
Location is great and they have an awesome happy hour. But housekeeping doesn't come until late in the day so that was annoying. We'd come back to the room around 2:30/3 0'clock and it still hadn't been touched by housekeeping.,1
An amazing hotel! We booked a room with a view and it was gorgeous.. from seeing the sunset glow in the high rise buildings to watching them all start to twinkly as darkness fell. Staff were lovely. Tea and coffee facilities and hairdryer in room. Cool water and ice where you can fill your drink bottles up. Breakfast pretty much the same each day.. sausage bacon| scrambled eggs| waffles| maple syrup| fruit| yoghurt| cereals| juices and an egg station where you have your omelette or fried eggs cooked freshly for you. I didn't really believe previous views that there would be a free bar.. but sure enough between 17.30 and 19.30 any drinks are free.. wine| beers| mixers and spirits and cocktails and snacks.. cheese and biscuits| doughnut balls| tortilla chips and dips etc. Our room was spacious had a decent tv and shower room. Location is perfect as very central Manhattan. Close to Times Square| 5th Avenue and Empire State Building and much more all in walking distance.,1
Good: comfy bed| plenty and good selections of breakfast| friendly staff| generally quietNot so good (although not terribly bad): small room and awkward studio floor plan| low room ceiling| limited seating at breakfast,1
It was less thar what I expected for that much money,1
This was an excellent  hotel. Updated| clean and quiet. It could use another elevator bank| as the wait for the elevators could be long at times. Otherwise it was outstanding. Amazing free breakfast in the morning to get you going.,1
Breakfast was chaos! Small room| crowded| often ran out of food. Hotel room was super tiny| unable to lock bathroom| room was sometimes warm. Otherwise great central location to many sites| nice courtyard outdoors| staff were friendly & professional!,1
Very nice place & conveniently located to many attractions.,1
Loved the location and the view. It was fairly quiet yet right in the city. Staff was friendly.,1
Location excellent| staff great and breakfast great. Pull out bed not so great.,1
Check in was 4pm and room was not ready| not just for me but for many frustrated guests waiting for their room.  People had dinner reservations| theater tickets| concert tickets and were waiting.  Front desk seemed quite used to this.  If you plan on using the sleeper sofa think twice unless it's for a 10 year old.  It's nothing more than a pull out chair| not even as wide as a twin bed.  Next day we were out of the room all day.  Came back exhausted to find the room had never been cleaned and there were no clean towels.  Called to the front desk and they brought up two towels.  Ended up finding a cart in a hallway and took the towels we needed for the 3 of us.  Clearly this hotel has a problem with inefficient housekeeping that they can't get the rooms ready for check in and don't clean rooms for guests staying more than one night.  The bed was very comfortable.,0
Checked in to room to find urine and toilet paper in toilet| debris of some kind in shower| tv with scratching on screen.,0
Very clean hotel| great service and close to subway and Times Square,1
Location - helpful staff - gym - good food.i didn't dislike a thing,1
My room was not ready when I arrived (4:30 pm) although the check in time was at 4pm. Had toneait for 45 minutes before i got all my room keys.,1
Property was very clean. The breakfast was very good. Excellent service.,1
Found a pair of used underwear in the bed when checking in. Horrible service throughout with requests mostly forgotten and not looked into.,0
good location. clean room. good complimentary breakfast.,1
The location is great| the breakfast was wonderful| and the evening reception was ideal.,1
The view from our room was incredible!!!!,1
I loved the breakfast buffet and the free drinks and snacks every night from 5-7! Room was comfy and clean!,1
Accessible to everything. Good service and buffet food was excellent.,1
Location was great. Didn't like the scaffolding around buildings in area,1
Everyone was super nice.  Had great bartenders and the breakfast was phenomenal.  Rooms were clean and above average for size in New York.  It was a nice stay .,1
The hotel provides solid value and it quite serviceable for a short stay| but the room layout was a bit of a challenge. The sole closet was located in the bathroom. The bathroom had a sliding door with no lock. And there was very little desk space| making it a bit more challenging to work. Overall| it is a high quality stay| given price relative to others in the area| with some minor challenges.,1
On the not so good side| there are too few elevators which resulted in long waits at times.  FOX ‚Äúnews‚Äù was on 24/7 in the lobby which I found to be totally inappropriate| especially in NYC. There was confusion regarding the parking. My voucher was stamped and told I would pay at the garage. I was at IPark and I later found out the parking fee was to be charged to my room.  It was all worked out in the end.  Finally| the garage employee took over 1/2 hour to find my car!,1
Location great. Newer hotel and rooms. Excellent breakfast.,1
convenient ! walking distance to heart of NYC the Empire Building . staff are friendly .,1
the hotel room is very clean| however| room service did not refill shampoo/conditioner| we had to call fro,1
All just spot on for us| it's a city rooms are going to be small but they were really nice! Breakfast was PACKED but always found a seat and hey it's NYC. The staff were amazing| one girl on reception was a bit off hand a few times but she was pregnant so probably just tired :-),1
The room was very dirty The sheets smelled |three slow elevators that serve 39 floors |A very small dining room that did not fit the number of people|The only thing that was positive was the locationnot coming back,0
Nice time visiting our son| hotel is in a good location.  Nice breakfast| friendly staff,1
The hotel was very nice and clean. The location was great-its within walking distance of many landmarks and subway stations. My only complaint is that the front desk staff while efficient were not going above and beyond. They did not explain anything about the hotel or the stay. On check-in all they said was what my room number was and where the elevator was. NOTHING about how to use the elevator or that the hotel had free drinks and snacks at the hotel reception on the 4th floor. They did not even offer anything about the Hilton Honors program. They OFFERED no helpful info unless asked. Nice hotel and nice price but don't expect any info from the front desk.,1
What a fantastic hotel and it's such a perfect location! We were on the 25th floor with a terrific view- The room was smaller but tastefully decorated and the use of Space was wonderful! Delicious included breakfast‚Ä¶ Walking distance to so many things| hotel staff was super friendly- Definitely recommend this hotel! :),1
Made-to-order breakfast was different for this location. Not many hotels have this amentity included in the nightly rate. Great perk!,1
We stayed there for our anniversary. The room was tiny. There wasn't a cocktail hour which is who we book there. Vouchers were given for one drink at a bar a block away. When you want to chill out after a long day that's the last thing you want to do. The elevators are a nightmare. We carried our luggage down after a 25 minute wait.,1
Great location.  Rooms were on the smallish size but appear to be on par with other NY hotels.  Room was clean and serviced every day.  Breakfast was plentiful with a great range of foods.  Would stay here again,1
All in all| I would definitely recommend the hotel and would happily stay there again! It's been an absolute pleasure staying at Embassy suites by Hilton :),1
The view is awesome and the breakfast is delicious,1
The bed was nice and cozy and the breakfast buffet was really good.  I wish the room was larger and if only the hotel had a pool.  Thanks for the stay.,1
Location| breakfast| free evening reception and friendly staff were what we liked about this hotel.,1
"Beautiful new and clean hotel. Gorgeous breakfast with so much choice. Spacious room (despite previous comments). Shame there was no ""bar"" and one of the reception staff was borderline rude - not sure what her issue was as she had the same brusque attitude during 2 separate encounters - everyone else was very welcoming however.",1
There was noise in the walls. We asked them to assess the situation and we were told that they are working on replacing old pipes and this is the noise we were hearing. They offered to compensate with the equivalent of $20 in Hilton honor points when I spent $600. The front desk staff that assisted us was loud until we told them the issue in front of other guests at which point they pulled us aside very quietly. Truly disappointing! Elevator were so slow that people were taking the stairs. Great location but needs major improvement. TRULY DISAPPOINTED!,0
Breakfast wonderfull. All was amazing.,1
Modern hotel in a great location - stay there again at the drop of a hat,1
Fantastic location| close to 34 Herald subway. Lots of restaurants nearby. Breakfast was fantastic,1
Room was clean and very soundproof considering all the sirens in New York. Breakfast was excellent. Daily reception also excellent!,1
great location.  Breakfast was very substantial and tasty.  The staff was very friendly from front desk| to bellmen| to servers etc.  would definitely stay again.  good location - close to subway and attractions.,1
Great location. Well/run hotel. Near but not in the craziness of Times Square.,1
We are frequent Embassy Suites guestsm this was put first time at this location. It was a very nice and new hotel| friendly staff| small room (understandable in midtown NYC) but very comfortable with great view from the 25th floor. And great Embassy breakfast as usual!,1
Great breakfast and staff,1
My daughter and I had a wonderful stay in this wonderful hotel.  The breakfast was incredible!,1
The Embassy Suites is an amazing chain! They offer free drinks every night for their guests| and they have the best breakfast ever. Where else can you get unlimited bacon and omelettes made to order? I can always expect a clean room and great service at any Embassy Suites!,1
Everything was exceptional from location| staff| food| cleanliness. Having the onsite free breakfast made a big difference. The 5 to 7 was also a great bonus. Overall = highly satisfied. Thank you.,1
Good location| good breakfast and good service. Not all service from room cleaning were perfect but probably gets better after our complaint.,1
Wonderful stay at this hotel for 4 nights. Clean & Conveniently located. Short walk to Macy's. Breakfast is great but very crowded. Overall| very happy with our stay here in NYC.,1
Very nice hotel rooms in New York are very small! This hotel is within walking distance of a lot of stuff.,1
It was an excellent stay and convenient to so much!,1
The hotel is in a great location and the staff were attentive and responsive to questions| requests and at all times very polite.The breakfast was great. Fantastic variety of fresh fruit and hot food. Although at times it was very crowded and hard to find a table. Evening complimentary drinks and snacks on the 4th floor was really enjoyable after a day of sightseeing.For us travelling as a couple with a 14 year old the room was a little small. We made it work and had a wonderful time in New York being so close to Times Square| Broadway and the Empire State Building........,1
The hotel is clean| and the rooms are comfortable| if a bit bizarre. Our closet was right next to the toilet in the bathroom. The main problems were poor planning. The hotel has only 3 elevators and 39 floors. Ten minute waits for an elevator were common.  The breakfast/reception area was enirely too small. Our first and only experience with the breakfast buffet was like Black Friday with crowds| shoving| pushing| and near fights. There was nowhere to sit| and many of the serving dishes were empty. The staff was pleasant but snarky or absent. When we checked in| we were informed they had a room for us that was ‚Äúthe type of room Travelocity provides.‚Äù It was not| by any stretch of the imagination a suite. Other interactions with staff were extremely limited since we only caught site of the bellhop once| and there was no concierge. The maid service was once a day| period. Because of that| there were piles of dirty dishes| trash bags| etc. in the hallways most of the day. This was truly a disappointing experience.,0
Whilst the room was a tad small which is pretty standard in NY the location is excellent and quite central for all the key attractions| broadway  and shopping.The breakfast was excellent and the evening drinks reception a really nice touch and a differentiator.Also all the staff were very personable and helpful !,1
Everything about our stay was exceptional! The location was ideal. The staff were very friendly. The room with a divider was great and the view from the wall of windows was breathtaking. The full hot buffet breakfast was delicious and the complimentary drinks with snacks was an unexpected bonus. This is our new go to place in NYC!,1
Everything was really great.   I'd stay here again.,1
A very small closet for hanging clothes and no dresser for clothes.  There is a drawer under bed,1
Very central hotel| ideal for sightseeing or shopping. Walking distance to lots of areas. Complimentary breakfast| hot & cold foods| great selection.,1
We had a great stay! I'll be coming back next time I'm in NY.,1
Fabulous hotel! Really enjoyed our stay. Super central! Breakfast was fantastic üòÜ,1
The size of the room was smaller than what I expected from an Embassy Suites room.,1
Wonderful central location. Very chic and upscale hotel with wonderful breakfast. The bathroom could be bigger.,1
Our room was a billion times better than I expected. Yeah| it was spendy but wow| clean| comfortable| convenient location and the view from our balcony was breathtaking,1
Hotel staff| especially the evening manager on Saturday October 13 was exceptionally helpful and accommodating! My wallet was lost while my daughter and I were on a city tour and he really went out of his way to make sure we were taken care of. He even called the closest western union| explained my situation and prearranged a wire transfer that my husband and I didn't think was possible due to the fact that I didn't have any identification. If it weren't for his kindness and willingness to help the rest of our weekend would have been miserable. Thanks again!,1
Nice comfortable stay. The staff was really friendly. the rooms are big| beds really comfortable| and very quiet hallways. The breakfast was very good| many choices. I would definitely stay here again.,1
What a way to finish off a trip of a lifetime. Right in the centre of New York| close to the Empire state building and Times Square.  Reception staff were welcoming and helpful.  Our room was perfect.  Bed comfortable and shower very good. We also had a great view of the city. Excellent üòä,1
Elevators are slow and water pressure could be better| otherwise overall a great experience!,1
Excellent location in midtown. Hotel staff were great to work with and very accommodating.,1
Everything was perfect| except check in. They do room inspections at each check in. So once I checked in| I still had to wait about 20 min for them to do their inspection and give me a room key. I wasn't expecting that and I had a meeting to get to do it was a little annoying. Never stayed at a hotel that did inspections like that. I think they're intentions were good. Oh well. Other than that the staff and room were great.,1
Hotel Room as Shown on Expedia ... Very Pleased. Friendly Staff and very accommodating.Complimentary Breakfast was really great ... hot and lots of choices ... delicious omelets ( made to order). Added Bonus Outdoor SkyLawn Bar and also has a separate section with outdoor Movie Screen.  Great Location ... Walking Distance to Time Square. Memorable Stay !!,1
Wonderful time great staff very nice and clean rooms,1
Staff was great| nice rooms| had a small situation but it was handled perfectly and made it up to us| only complaint was the lobby and hallways were too hot,1
Checkin was quick and complimentary breakfast and happy hour were a welcomed surprise.  The only negative was having to request our room to be cleaned during the duration of our stay.,1
Nice hotel . The decore was awesome . Our first room wasn't clean and we informed the staff and they changed our room.,1
It was good. A slight misunderstanding at the front desk but it was quickly resolved.,1
Nice and comfortable hotel in the heart of Manhattan,1
Good location with easy access to mid-town sights| there is construction going on in that area| but it only made getting in and out difficult.  My room wasn't ready at check-in time| but otherwise the service was very good.  Breakfast is OK and very crowded during peak hours.,1
Very comfortable room. I was at floor 38 and the view was incredible,1
Great location close to empire state building and easy subway access. The room is small but clean and has microwave and refrigerator. There are only 3 elevators for 39 floors and it can be a long wait to go up or down. Keep your room access card handy because you need to scan it inside the elevators to operate it. Breakfast has a great variety but not enough seating| and crowded. Overall a great stay.,1
This was my second time staying at this hotel. First was with a friend and this time with my husband. Both times were fantastic. My husband can be picky too and he was so impressed. We both manage in customer service and were really happy with all the staff at the Embassy. So welcoming and friendly such a great addition to the clean and great atmosphere. This will definitely be my choice hotel in NYC from now on. We even tried to add a 3rd night last minute after we checked out but they were completely booked which is completely understandable! Got to enjoy the free reception this time too which was a great start to our evenings. Elevator and breakfast gets pretty busy but there's postings in the elevator advising best times for least amount of traffic that helped. Location is great the beds and pillows are so nice and comfy we didn't want to get out of bed! Amazing hotel guys - definitely knocked it out of the park a second time. Can't wait for the next trip!,1
Great location| friendly staff and perfect for my needs.,1
Location| staff| complimentary breakfast was great,1
They made us wait for almost 4 hours because our rooom was cancelled by hotels.com. The reason? Because we need to call/inform the hotel that we will be delayed for 2 days. It was so frustrating cause after a 24 hour flight and 2 cancelled flights because there was an accident at our airport runway where all flights were cancelled for 2 days. Our reservation was paid ahead. If not calling the hotel means loosing our reservation then why was the other room not cancelled? I cannot understand this incident.,0
a special shout out to Cleo| the front desk manager| who rectified a problem at checkin| with complete grace and competence.  many thanks to all!!!!,1
So conveniently near restaurants| shopping| tourist  and theater destinations| we practically only needed to  walk to where we wanted to go. It was only a few  blocks away from the 34th Street Subway Station so  getting to other parts of NY was also easy. The room was more spacious than I expected and the beds were comfortable. The Breakfast Buffet was also substantial (and you can even take food to go).  They also had free drinks and socials at 5:00-7:00. Over-all| we were pretty happy with our choice and would definitely stay here again the next time we travel to NYC. :),1
Breakfast was quite good| with fresh fruit.,1
Very good hotel with amazing view. Location is good - two blocks from subway station| near Time Square. Snack time every evening 5pm to 7 pm. Good breakfast - omelet made by order| fruits| bread| eggs| cakes etc. Would love to stay here again.,1
Breakfast time was very crowded and not easy to get a table.,1
beyond expectation on this hotel. The breakfast was actually much better than what I'm used to for american hotels.  Internet was great. The view was amazing (28th floor). Location was perfect| walking distance to everything| but not disturbing from traffic or so. Really great service.,1
Fantastic place! Strongly recommended!,1
Found the hotel to be absolutely beautiful stuff out of this world and restaurant food like no other I truly enjoyed my stays can't wait to stay there again,1
Basic hotel. No frills or thrills. Staff was accommodating when I checked in. However they were not accommodating when I checked out early because I had to get home because of the coronavirus pandemic..,1
The staff was very courteous and was able to accommodate our early arrival.,1
overall a good hotel for the price. the bed cover had other people's hair on it and looked pretty beat up which was not ideal to say the least.,1
Great lication! Staff was really helpful and friendly. Quick check in and out,1
The room was spotless| staff were so helpful and friendly and the location was spot on!! Would stay again for sure :),1
Amazing best stay in a midtown mid-class hotel.  Very clean and a friendly staff also there is space for you to put your stuff down in the bathroom| quiet rooms| comfortable pillows and a great iron that does'nt leak.,1
We had a great stay and excellent service. I can't remember the name of our concierge| but I know he recently moved to New York City from Orlando| Florida. He was extremely friendly and helpful during our stay.,1
Close to penn station and clean. Accommodation to change rooms great,1
Very comfortable and  property location near most things of note. Easy check in and out.,1
Good value for midtown Manhattan.  Very helpful staff.,1
Great location| very clean room and bathroom. Friendly staff. I would stay there again. Great value.,1
Great location| excellent bathroom space| clean and comfortable,1
I felt much thought was put into security at the hotel. I particularly liked the fact that you needed your room key to gain access to the floors containing guest rooms & to access the lobby late at night.,1
Rooms were clean and well appointed. Staff was friendly and very helpful.,1
Loved it. Quiet. Always Staying here when visiting NYC,1
The room was excellent! Very clean and well taken care of.,1
This hotel was very comfortable| clean| and spacious.,1
Good location and excellent dtaff,1
The hotel is nice| not large and has three elevators.  We never had to wait at any point during the day.  Plus you had to use your room key to enable the elevator.  We paid extra for the breakfast| they have a menu or buffet.  The food was good| the servers were very nice.  There are couple of places in the areas to grab coffee| sandwich or pastry if you don't want to sit down and eat.  The hotel is close to Madison Square gardens| not a lot of restaurants to eat at in the area.,1
Exactly what I expected and needed| clean| staff were helpful| great location for seeing the sights etc,1
Had an amazing stay. Clean room and comfy bed.A+++,1
I stayed at this property in July of 2019 and was surprised as to how clean and spacious and updated it was! I had such a good experience| I decided to stay here again and I had same experience! It was a great stay - so clean and everyone was lovely.,1
Good location and depending on availability can be very well-priced,1
It was clean and accessible. My room was next to the emergency exit and that door is VERY loud which was  annoying some days.,1
I had a delayed flight and ended up checking in after midnight. Had no issues and the staff couldnt have been any more helpful with quick and easy check in. Great value for the location and convience.,1
Very Friendly Staff| Nice location| Good Bar on Property.,1
I like the staff| cleanliness| gym and breakfast. The location was also convenient.,1
Not big room but new and comfortable.Good location on a quiet street near time square. The only thing down is breakfast| not worth for prepurchase. Seems provided by third party.,1
The hotel is in a great location. A short walk to Times Square in one direction| and Penn station is only a couple of minutes away in the other direction. All  aspects of the room were fine| and it was spotlessly clean. The only downside was that the staff on shift during our check in were not very welcoming and a little rude| but all other staff that we encountered were helpful and friendly.,1
Very good and clean hotel too near from Times Square,1
This was an awesome place to stay! Centrally located to Times Square and within walking distance to everything you'll ever need. The staff was helpful and friendly and the room was very comfortable. We'll stay here again!,1
Pillows are terrible get new ones,1
Excellent front  of  house service.   On site restaurant was perfect.,1
The staff was so friendly and so attentive. The restaurant attached was yummy and the staff there was great as well. I felt so safe on the property| there is a safety feature that makes you use key fob to even gain access to the floors. Rooms and hotel are very clean and the location is close to everything we needed. Staying there again on next trip!,1
The hotel was extremely clean and in a great location,1
Clean|  good location|  close to Times Square|  restaurants|  shopping|  and subway.  Staffs were nice and friendly.,1
Convenient to Times Square and Penn Station.  Area seemed safe| though we were not out very late.   Staff were friendly and room was comfortable and clean.  They were very acxommodating.  We were able to check in a little early and they held our bags for us in the last day so we could go see The Rockettes.,1
Quality stay. Good service. Would recommend,1
The staff was great and it would be nice to have a continental breakfast for guests.  Otherwise| we would stay there again,1
The picture was really nice big rooms and beautiful views. I paid pretty higher than other hotels but It wasn't worth it. I'm so disappointed service and tiny room. I would never stay in this hotel. I wouldn't recommend that.,0
Supper clean! Friendly staff! Will be back for sure!,1
Very clean and pleasant. Front desk was courteous and very helpful. Definitely would come back and stay here again.,1
Went to a show at Jacob Javitz and this was very convenient,1
Excellent location. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Beds were so comfy. Great nights sleep.  Nothing wrong with the hotel| but if there was to be a change| the lobby could do with something to give it a lift.,1
The hotel was in a convenient location for us between Penn Station and Times Square and the staff was very helpful and accommodating with recommendations.,1
This is a great location| and a great value... so many other hotels in NYC charge a premium for so-so accommodations and so-so service... solid choice - you won't regret it.,1
3rd party breakfast in a hotel. Looks that hotel want to become only over night station .,1
Booked at the last minute & close to MSG| 8th Ave & Times Square. Clean| comfortable & friendly staff!,1
A good| comfortable hotel with excellent service.  We were seen to immediately on arrival with a friendly welcome.  As we had arrived in the morning straight from a cruise the room wasn't ready but our luggage was taken straight to a secure room to await our return from a stroll around the area (well situated for Times Square itself & walkable to most local sights).  The lobby area was quite small but with comfortable chairs & chilled water available.  A small in hotel shop had most things you could require.  The attached Irish pub/restaurant 'Doylers' gave us just what we wanted on a cold October evening (Fish & chips & Shepard's pie!)  The room was a reasonable size| air conditioned & with a comfortable king sized bed.  Complimentary wi-fi was available throughout the hotel.  We would definitely stay here again when in New York.,1
Very comfortable and the employees there are awesome!,1
Great central location| friendly| helpful staff at the front desk and in the restaurant| good pub on the main floor| and clean| fairly new rooms. Will definitely see if Hilton Garden Inn is available next time through NYC. I booked through Expedia and by the time I checked in a King room wasn't available| but they were able to make up for it with breakfast.,1
This was my first trip to NYC and thought it was a very good hotel for the price and location.  The employees were very pleasant and helpful and the beds were comfortable.  The rooms were a bit smaller than a normal hotel room| but were clean and made good use of the space.,1
Great spot to stay. Convenient to theaters and Penn Station. Friendly staff. Clean rooms.,1
Great location I would stay there again. Very clean room and very affordable,1
Smooth and easy check-in. Place was nice and clean! Staff was great.,1
Close to time square so that was nice! Booked last minute and price wasn't too bad,1
Love the location and the price. Staff was incredible at the front desk. Cons: Bed was HORRIFIC! It felt like I was sleeping on plywood boards. Had to ask for more pillows to use as a mattress pad.When we got to the room| the door wasn't latching properly| even with the deadbolt. Maintenance was great| and reassured us it was fine. However| they shouldn't be checking guests into a room unless the entry way is 100% secure.Would I stay at Hilton again? YesThis location? If better mattresses were installed.,1
This hotel was great| close to many attractions and to many bars/restaurants/bakery etc. Nothing to complain about.. I would definitely suggest it to everyone!,1
That's my only complaint. Everything else was surprisingly great.,1
great location| clean room| well maintained| nice customer service!!!,1
It was a good trip...okay location.  The hotel is really nice| clean and our stay was very comfortably.  The customer service was nice and helpful.,1
It was so convenient and close to everything. Staff was great. Very clean.Only thing I didn't like was the fact that they used too much bleach for cleaning. Otherwise wonderful,1
They put us in a handicap room #805 which was fine but it was right next to a utility closet so we heard doors opening and closing all the time. Plus the other room doors were super close so there was constant noise.,1
Nothing super fancy| but certainly a clean| comfortable place to stay.,1
Room was spacious and comfortable. Polite staff. Window opened which is a huge plus. And finally a gym with working equipment - hooray! Only complaints: heavy air freshener smell in the room; and only one fan speed (noisy.) Blue Maiz good Mexican takeout and Pret a Manger nearby. Would definitely stay here again.,1
This place is great for the price.  I would stay here again,1
I loved how it was right near the bus station and near food places that we loved eating at. I would highly recommend to anyone who's going to NY.,1
Three nights in NYC. Check in was easy| particularly since I arrived at 10:30am| a room was ready for me| and there was no surcharge for early check-in| as some hotels do.  The staff is terrific; someone greets you every time you come in or leave.  Great housekeeping| quiet floors| a brightly lit bathroom and fast-arriving elevators.  A bit more expensive than my last stay at this property|| but hey| when you walk out the door you're in New York City.,1
It's right in the middle of EVERYTHING in NYC!!! Yet off the beat path and quiet!! Very very happy with our stay here!!!,1
Great location| clean and comfortable room| good bar| Excellent hotel.,1
This hotel is not friendly for family vacation. We asked for a double bed room| there was none available. We could not leave either as it was pre-paid with Hotel for 6 nights. We ended up booking two rooms. During the last day| I asked again| and was told they had one available. They would hold it for us. So I returned one of the rooms| all packed up| waiting for the news that the room became available until 11:30 am. Still no news. I called the front desk again and was told it was not available anymore. They could have told us earlier. You can see the service here. The blind in the room broke. I asked them to fix it| they did| and it broke again. Make you wonder about other things. Definitely avoiding this place in the future| and having 2nd thoughts on Hilton Garden Inn which we're a Hhonor member of. I don't normally leave reviews| but feel like I need to for future travelers. Location is convenient.  That's the only thing.,0
Room is small but functional. The location is not so hot because it is close to Port Authorities bus terminal. A lot of homeless people around the area,1
I like that it's quiet even it's in mid town. Also| there are so many stores that you can get anything you forget to bring. However| when I book| it was mentioned that shower/bathtub which I expected to get but it ended up there was only shower.,1
Hotel rooms very small and aircon very noisey. The Irish pub in lobby has great staff and we ate breakfast there and had afternoon drinks. The area seems a little seedy and the location is ok. Depends which part of NY you want to be in,0
Very beautiful place. Clean room. People will were very friendly.,1
Nice and clean...good location! Front desk was very nice and very informative with any questions.,1
I will definitely stay here again. Easy commute there and great location. Close to a lot of places near 34th street,1
Location was grest the property is in a great location the staff were very friendly and helpful. Would suggest this property to others,1
Very convenient location in Manhatan. Amenities are new and up to date. Room is a little small| but expected in downtown area.,1
"This hotel was perfect for a weekend getaway in NYC| especially for the price!  The location was perfect.  Not directly in the heart of Times Square| so you were able to get back to a quiet area| but it was just a short walk to get back into the ""action"".  The hotel was very clean| the room was nice and comfortable.  The bar area was a good place to get drinks and the convenience store had a good selection of food| drinks| etc. The staff was very friendly and attentive| especially the bar tenders.  We would definitely stay here again!",1
Wonderful staff. Loved restaurant down stairs well staffed| very friendly!!,1
The shower have some hair  is the only entering is very good,1
The hotel was very clean and in a convenient area of New York.  I would definitely stay there again.,1
Great hotel and location is close by. Room was clean and modern. The front desk staff was awesome especially Sam. Check-in was efficient and fast,1
Very clean and modern,1
I price great for the location.  Close to broadway,1
Really clean and comfortable. We were able to check our bags before and after our stay so we could walk around the city before check in and after checkout.,1
Nice hotel with a clean and comfortable room,1
Easy and accessible location| very friendly and helpful service. The room was incredibly quiet despite being in a busy part of the city| comfortable and incredibly clean,1
Loved our Hilton stay in NYC! Perfect location| great staff!  We look forward returning soon,1
It was beautiful very very clean,1
The hotel was great in a great area convenient to all the local tourist areas easy to get uptown to Times Square and Central Park and an easy metro ride to the World Trade Center. Anything you needed was two blocks away or less.,1
An hour to check in| booked us in 705| 1205 and 1505 all rooms with ice machines and linen closet in front. The manager made a comment that it's because I booked from Expedia not with hotel. Manager Carlos pretended that he did not hear our complaints,0
Very nice & clean place. Only problem is breakfast should be complementary. Also mirrors needed in the room & elevator.,1
Nice hotel| convenient location to midtown. Would stay there again.,1
Best NYC hotel stay I've had in years! Checked in early with no problem| and check out took 3 seconds. Friendly staff. Excellent location| cleanliness| room size| big shower! Bed was a little firm for my liking but still comfortable. Wish I read the label on the ‚Äúfree‚Äù water before getting charged $8. It is only for Hilton Honors members| apparently.,1
First off the staff was incredible especially James and Margarita they went above and beyond to ensure my friends and I were taken care of the best customer service I've ever seen. The rooms were perfect nice comfortable great views and location definitely plan on staying there again.,1
Perfect for location and needs,1
The hotel was clean and room/ bathroom spacious for New York standards.  Pub next door was handy as was 7-11 on the corner.  Walking distance to Time Square and close proximity to hop on tours.,1
Great friendly staff especually the Irish bar guys.,1
Hotel was great| nothing negative about it!!,1
Great location! Close to Times Square! Nice size room!,1
Check-in experience was excellent with very attentive front desk staff helping me with one hour early check-in.  Room was small and coffee maker| ironing board| folding suitcase holder| etc| are all hidden in small closet which I had to take out/set up by myself.  It was only one night stay just by myself| so size of the room was not really an issue and room has safe| refrigerator| microwave| and the hotel has a restaurant where I ordered food for delivery to the room which was convenient especially when I did not want to go out to eat.  Room was quiet and elevator works with room key which adds extra safety.  The only thing is price... I understand NYC price| but much lower price ($200-$250) would be suitable considering nothing extra added and almost $50 total tax I paid.,1
Charge for parking was extra and customer has to pay separately to garage. There should be a contract with parking garage and it should be included in the price. It is a hassle if customer has to find parking garages late in evening & also to pay them. Breakfast was extra charge too & quite expensive!,1
Nice ans clean property. The cleaning lady was extremely polite and sweet.,1
Got red eye flight| came in at 5 am| the staff was nice to let me ‚úî in early to rest before my long conference day. Greatly appreciated,1
Great area for the Garden and downtown--Very nice customer service. I would gladly stay there again!,1
Loved the property and location. The room was great and wanted to stay longer. will be back,1
The location was great for Times Square Action| Nice Irish Bar in the lounge| Secure Area.,1
Great service. The front desk was very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay there again,1
Fantastic clean property with impeccable service!  Cozy rooms are well appointed and the Garment District location is convenient to everything in Midtown.,1
Amazing Stay & Great service.,1
Very unhappy with both hotels.com and Hilton. There was some issue with the reservation and Hilton claims they did not receive the payment from hotels.com| without any notice Hilton charged my credit card to pay for the room... I spent 2 hours of my holidays trying to get it sorted via chat to finally get reimbursed in voucher money... What a mess| first time I use hotels and probably one of the last...,0
Close to port authority as well as NY Penn station. Place is calm| clean with good amount of space and aminities.,1
Room has a small fridge| pod coffee machine and a microwave.,1
The room was perfect for a one night couples trip,1
And YES| I tried to make it a few degrees colder OR warmer| hoping the WHOOSH would stop| but ... No Such Luck.,1
Everything was perfect! Great staff great amenties. Also a microwave in the room with a keurig,1
Great location and friendly staff. The service was excellent.,1
Clean| friendly| nice rooms.  Would come stay again.,1
Stay was great! Only issue was that i never got the toiletries i requested from guest services and checked out an hour early because my conf email said 11 so they may want to correct Expedia on that.,1
Got a last minute room in order to attend a work conference and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the hotel for the price. Since it was between avenues| it was very quiet despite being in a very busy area. The staff were friendly| helpful and moved quickly| and were able to answer all questions I had. The bed was super comfy| the fitness center well-stocked and clean| the check-in and check-out painless and since I had to leave very late on my check-out day I was even able to check my luggage all day. I also really appreciated having the fridge| microwave and Keurig machine. Would definitely stay again.,1
Very nice service and a great spot! Price is unbelievably good and the counter staff amazing!,1
Bad view but everything else was fine| couldn't ask for much more from a hotel. Did exactly what it should and was very clean and the people were all very nice and helpful.,1
This was our 12th visit to NYC so we've stayed at many hotels in different areas of Manhattan.  This hotel was in a great location logistically for getting around the city.  The rooms were super clean and so was the hotel.  Staff was excellent.  We will definitely look into staying at the Hilton Garden Inn on a future trip.  Bed was super comfy too.  Hotel is family friendly and overall A+.,1
Bathroom was not extra clean (dust on counter| hairs on shower tiles) but otherwise hotel was nice and well located.,1
All was great except the view| looking into the windows of a garment factory behind the hotel.,1
Great hotel and nice attached Irish Pub,1
This was a great hotel. Very clean and friendly staff. The only issue that I had was that when I booked the hotel it wasn't clear that they had many properties in Manhattan. The one that I thought I booked wasn't the one that I actually stayed in. It was further away from Times Square than I thought.,1
Great location for our NYE plans!!!!,1
We were in town to witness the 2019 ball drop at Times square and the with the rain deluge over the 7 hour queue wait| it was a godsend to take a break at the room.,1
Clean and close to my desired areas.thank you 5hank you,1
Friendly staff and quality hotel for a good price.,1
i enjoyed staying at this hotel. it was really clean| the room had a good amount of space for 2 people| and the location was good for being in times square. the only thing is parking. which is always so hard but it took forever to find a spot for a good price. wish they could offer a garage. other than that 10/10,1
Great location| very clean. Great friendly helpful staff. Strongly recommend this hotel for those who want a reasonable place to stay within walking distance of most midtown attractions.,1
Great location| clean and welcoming hotel.,1
Check in was fast efficient Janes had me checked in and i was in my room in 5 mins very nice hotel friendly and good location,1
Very friendly.  Just had to ask to clean our room because we slept past 9am,1
Stay was pretty comfortable. Wish there was complementary water though.,1
It was a great trip. The hotel and staff were absolutely wonderful.  The room was small & it had no closet (just a little hutch) but it worked out just fine.  We couldn't have been more happy with our hotel.,1
Parking overnight is $55 and the property is a bit off the beaten path for a tourist in NYC. The room was clean and even had a little microwave which is a nice accommodation for a small space... but the view from our window was another building and for the price you can get a hotel closer to Time Square with an amazing view. All in all likely will not stay here again based on personal preference| but would stay in a Hilton brand hotel in a better location.,1
The bed was comfy. The staff were friendly and accommodating. They held our luggage after checkout for a couple hours so we could go downtown for a couple more things. The room had a microwave and mini fridge if you needed such things,1
Best room I have found in Times Square!| Nice location!,1
The views on the top floor are stunning and the hotel is very well-maintained.,1
Great location| comfortable and convenient. Staff was very accommodating| great and affordable stay!,1
Amazing and great location,1
Great location at a great price! Room was very clean and service was good!,1
booked thru Hotels.com and had no issues at all. Hotel was clean and friendly and overall very satisfied,1
Quiet road in Midtown. Clean facility. Friendly staff. Stayed here once before and forgot I liked it. Will book again.,1
Good location and the staff was very friendly and accommodating.,1
Tucked in a quiet corner just a few blocks from Times Square and Herald Square. Super close to multiple subway lines  Able to store your luggage so you can go explore and enjoy the city without being burdened with bags. Very friendly and helpful staff. And| very nice| clean rooms.,1
Customer service was awesome. The location was great!,1
Great location| great hotel.,1
Very clean| great staff| great location. Affordable.,1
The staff members at the hotel were very helpful and friendly. The hotel was decorated for the holidays and it looked great. Definitely recommend this hotel!,1
Location was great for Madison Square Garden event.   Close to Macy's as well.  Had dinner at two great restaurants within a couple of blocks of the hotel.   Staff was very helpful and friendly.  Wonderful stay.,1
The hotel is clean| safe| and a good value. It's within walking distance to Times Square and is a good area to be in as a tourist. The room was spacious and had a nice bathroom| and the staff were helpful and nice.,1
Everything was great until I had to kill a huge water bug in the bathroom,1
we were able to check in early. The day we left we were able to extend our checkout time for an hour. This was a great experience. Staff was Very nice. Would say here again.,1
It was a wonderful stay.  The hotel staff were friendly and accommodating.  The hotel is in a great location and the rooms were comfortable and quiet.  I plan to stay at the hotel the next time I am in New York.,1
Uncomfortable bed with a hump in the middle. Service staff was excellent. Very clean. Price was a little bit high.,1
Very clean hotel. Staff was excellent and helpful. My only complaint is the water bottles provided in the room not being free to all guests.,1
So very clean and quiet. They offer a small market down in the lobby and there is an Irish bar in the lobby. Great stay !,1
The location is fantastic| very central to all the big attractions. The price is also very good so this hotel is a great value. It's clean and staff is professional. The room is a bit smaller but that is expected in central manhattan at that price point. Very clean| even got ya checked in early. Appreciate when staff goes above and beyond.,1
Room was kind of squished and when we arrived there wasn't a room available| but the staff were excellent and very friendly!  The restaurant staff were fabulous as well!  Didn't feel uncomfortable walking in the area and it was very well maintained.,1
Sam the hotel clerk who checked me in was the most engaging professional hotel clerk I've ever met in my 22 years of business travels,1
The staff was awesome. Great location and very nice hotel. Would definitely stay here again.,1
The location is ideal for working or visiting Times Square| Broadway or the Fashion District.  The hotel was clean| quiet| and the staff was friendly.,1
Staff was extremely helpful. Location excellent. Would stY again.,1
Great bed| bar in the lobby| quiet street| great customer service| clean| close to everything fun| small rooms| no complimentary water/coffee or tea.,1
The staff was attentive and courteous. I stayed in a Skyview room with a king bed. The skyline view was incredible and the outdoor lighting during the day was pleasant| the room was clean| and the bed was comfortable. While the room itself was snug; however| that's not unusual for a hotel room in NYC. I didn't mind since it was just me| and how the space was organized was efficient and effective. This will definitely be a go-to hotel for me when I need to stay overnight in NYC. I appreciated it's convenience to Penn Station.,1
Great location| cozy room| professional customer services.,1
Good location and friendly greeting. Rooms were decent size for New York City. Very clean and modern rooms. Quiet at night| and comfortable beds. Would recommend this hotel and hope to come back again.,1
What a kind and amazing staff! Arrived early 11am hoping to just drop off bags before an early show but was very surprised when they offered an early check in to us.  The room was spotless and smelled amazing(the very first comment my daughter made when we opened the door to our room).  Slept like a baby on the comfy bed.  It was so quiet that you would have never known you were on a busy NYC street.  Cannot wait to come back and stay here again!!,1
Thumbs Up! Only downside was cleaning staff tried to come clean our room at 4:30pm when we were resting after a day of site seeing. Maybe an oversight?,1
The hotel is in a very convenient area in the garment district. We used to live in the area so we knew it was a good one for our trip needs. It is close to all of the touristy lights of Times Square and the events of Madison Square Garden but tucked away on a relatively quiet (by NYC standards) street. It was so quiet all night. I heard more noise when we stayed with family in Westchester. We got a great night's sleep. From check in to check out all of the staff we encountered were helpful and friendly. We will definitely be back. Thank you for making out quick getaway a great one!,1
The hotel was very nice and clean. Right where we wanted to be to see the sights of New York. The staff were incredible| always super helpful. I would stay there or another Hilton Garden Inn again.,1
The hotel was very clean. Rooms were small but had everything you need. Hotel employees were curtious and helped with any needs. Pricing wasn't bad either.,1
It was a pleasant stay in a convenient location.,1
The staff are not very friendly| but the room was nice.,1
The front desk staff were friendly and helpful.  The room was clean and well maintained.  This hotel is close to Penn. Station| Times Square| and the Port Authority Terminal.  There are some good restaurants and bars nearby on 9th avenue.  The bed had a dip in it| so we kept rolling into one another all night. Not very comfortable| but for one night in a good location I can handle anything.,1
Friendly staff. Smooth check-in and checkout process.,1
Service was amazing. Hotel was in good condition. Staff exceeded expectations.,1
Great staying experience. I will come back here next to stay at this hotel.,1
Excellent location and very quiet,1
Great size room for nyc and it was so close to the Javits Center| which was a bonus for me. Excellent staff and experience. Highly recommended,1
Nice place to stay for our first trip to NYC| will come back again.,1
Good location to reach many NY attractions close to subway,1
It was very nice and clean. We felt so comfortable,1
Hotel was recently updated. Very pleased with location| bed linens| and staff,1
Quick check in. Room was neat| quiet| and comfortable,1
This location was perfect because we just the a few blocks from Times Square but also not stuck in all that traffic. Anything you needed was within walking distance or a quick uber ride! The staff was very warm and welcomed us a soon as we checked in| they explained all the details of our stay as well. The lobby was very clean and so were the rooms. It was great being able to have a mini fridge as well as a microwave which came in handy with to-go we had left over! Overall a great place with spacious rooms.,1
Within walking distance to time square| Madison garden| top of the rock observatory| manhattan mall etc. The staff were very helpful and the room was prestine!,1
The place is spotless! Staff always so pleasant. Thanks| Giuliano| for facilitating an early check-in! Much appreciated. I would have stayed longer but the property was fully committed for the remainder of the weekend.,1
It is a nice hotel in a good location. I really enjoyed my stay.,1
Nice hotel with good service in a convenient  location.,1
It was extremely pleasant. It would've been phenomenal with a pool.,1
It is an update hotel with a nice| open lobby. The staff was very friendly. The rooms were big (for NYC) and clean. The neighborhood felt safe but wasn't great in terms of restaurants. However| it was close to a few spots and conveniently located to get to other parts of the city. The best part of the hotel is that they have a sound wall for rooms on the 1-4th floor. It blocks out basically all street noise. I stayed on the 5th floor but still couldn't hear any street noise. I have stayed in many| many NYC hotels and can always hear street noise. i will definitely stay at this hotel again.,1
I will definitely stay here again.,1
Great location and a decent price.,1
Excellent value| very clean| and great location. The staff was very friendly and considerate. I would definitely stay here again!,1
Good location| nice room| and very attentive staff.,1
Great choice near Penn Station.  New hotel| spotless good size rooms| staff is super friendly and accomodating.,1
Great hotel| clean and comfortable. Will stay again.,1
Room was extremely clean and comfortable. Check in was fast and easy.,1
Great customer service and location,1
The room was clean and quiet. By the compactness & comfortableness of the room| I remember a hotel room in the urban area of Japan.,1
Centric and nice well located| clean and confortable rooms,1
good location (near to PENN station| easy access to/from JFK by LIRR),1
Staff very friendly| very clean room and good location in hell's kitchen. The room was very silent and there was almost no noise from street. Good Irish pub on hotel with good beers and food. Close to Times Square and major midtown atractions.,1
Good hotel with good size rooms and a bright interior. The area is close by  restaurants and a good location if you work in the area,1
Limited parking,1
Property was spacious and comfortable Staff was helpful and polite Parking too expensive and not clear in ad that it was not included,1
Roof top hangout and loved the kitchen in our room.Breakfast was just ok Wifi not happening,1
Great view| excellent room and helpful staff.,1
I stayed at this location for four days leading up to me flying out of the US - I had my dogs with me. All I can say is thank you to everyone. The cleaning team are amazing and so conscientious. Absolute pleasure staying here,1
Great staff good area near subway lines clean safe hotel,1
Parking situation was not great but expected in NYC. So close to subway and great restaurants; perfect and affordable location to see/visit Manhattan!,1
Very clean| friendly staff| great breakfast. Nice rooms with kitchen amenities.,1
It was a great stay. This hotel is in a very convenient area for our stay. The subway is steps away down the street. Parking was tricky though we used a lot on the next block over. It was not bad $60 for three days. We took the subway too get around the city. It was our first time and once we learned the routes we were good. Train N was our friend took us too Times Square and Coney Island.,1
The man at the front desk was amazing. Helped us with a situation and was always courteous.,1
Nice hotel| nice rooms| breakfast included I would stay again,1
My experience was lovely. I would come back soon it was very clean and the employees were very nice.,1
I wish it had parking but it was closed.,1
The front-desk workers and cleaners were pleasantly efficient and the hotel service and amenities exceeded my expectations. Many grocery store and restaurants options are available around just a few blocks away from the hotel. Me and my friends really enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back!,1
I love everything| but when I see the breakfast open| was wonderful!!!,1
Easy check In | everything was clean and friendly staff,1
The service was excellent,1
The front desk was incredibly friendly and helped make our stay special. Thank you!,1
Our stay was excellent as usual. The room was quiet and comfortable.,1
We always try to book at this hotel is very spacious and clean I've been here a couple of times as a mini stay cation. Will def go back,1
I wish they gave some complementary water while staying at the hotel. Especially since we are in a covid crisis. Other than that it was great,1
Stayed here many times. It's always nice. Good breakfast| clean rooms. Close to train.,1
Free parking is also available on the street.  Close to midtown Manhattan. Great place to stay with family yet very sound proof.,1
The hotel was lovely. The only thing I would change is the queen beds don't seem like queens more like a full size. Also the floors are way too slippery.I almost got jacked up a few times lol.,1
Very disappointing. I have visit this hotel on several occasions. My partner and I are business travelers and From the first time to now  this hotel has  360‚Ä¢ turn from 4 stars down to 1 star. This hotel is overrated and overpriced on hotels.com conditions are noticeably bad| amenities  look old and worn out. Bed sheets| towels do not look fresh clean| smelled like cooking oil. This is very unfortunate. Won't visit again.,0
The room was breaking down| all day and night the elevator made noises and i can hear it from the room,0
Our room was spotless clean! I was amazed at how clean everything was. I was greeted by Mara| who was super friendly and continued to ask if everything was good. We had an issue with the remote on the tv| but Enzo took care of the problem. There was a pizza/restaurant to get anything 1/2 block away. The room had everything! Dishwasher | coffeemaker| microwave| all utensils| dishes| cups completely sanitized. Halls/elevators immaculate. Breakfast was fresh and good. Coffee in the lobby 24 hours free. I am 68 and lived in NY my whole life. I don't care if I am now visiting anywhere in NY| This is where I will stay! With the corona virus rampant| we felt 100% safe. Thank You Mara and Enzo for a fantastic stay! I have never been in a Hotel that was as clean as this everywhere! We have made this our favorite place to stay We had such a great time and didn't worry about anything. Look| I don't usually write reviews unless it was terrible| but We could not find anything wrong with place. We Love it! We Love it! Thank you for a great stay. See you soon!,1
It was clean|but only issue was while checking in they took forever.,1
The rooms are good sized and that's not normal for NYC or  near the city. Area is failing due to the virus| but all food choices will deliver.,1
Spacious rooms and close to public transportation| train lines.,1
FOR $30 PARKING IS NOT GREAT. WITH THE LIMITED SPACES PARKING SHOULD BE INCLUDED OR DEFINITELY NOT $30 A NIGHT,1
Very friendly| accommodating staff. Good location for where I needed to get to. Breakfast in the morning (prepackaged).,1
Pour service |they charge you for parking | the room was duty special the bathroom| when you ask for something the girl who was in charge when I sign in was so rude  the breakfast that they serve it's frozen sandwich's and cereal really bad service I don't will back again,0
Very good place to stay which could stay more longer,1
The room was nice. I really enjoyed my time there.,1
Great location| easy to get to Manhattan. Pet friendly! Hotel was super clean and comfortable. In a relatively quiet area. There is free street parking if you look for it.,1
The room I had was twice as big as a regular room because I took an accessibility room !Having a seperate living and sleeping area was great!,1
"I was very impressed by this Hotel.  I arrived fairly earlier than the check-in time so I sat outside in my car to wait.  Unfortunately I had to use the restroom so i went inside and informed the front desk. ""Brian"" informed me that he lobby restrooms were not open but he would check to see if my room was ready and it was.  Brian saved my life! I will definitely be back!",1
It was fun the hotel room was pretty nice and more relaxing,1
Was not happy.  It started when,0
My husband and I loved our stay.  The room was super clean and so was the hotel.  The gentleman that checked us in was professional and attentive.  The room was spacious| and the bed was very confortable.  We really enjoyed having a kitchen and a full size refrigerator.  Will definitely come back!,1
I am definitely going to book a room here again if I ever want to stay close to the city in the future. The room was amazing and worth my money.,1
The staff was polite and attentive. The environment was clean and pleasant. Will definitely stay again and again!!,1
great stay best hotel in the area,1
The hotel was exactly as advertised. The room were nice and spacious. The employees were also polite and helpful. Would stay again.,1
It was ice and quiet,1
don't come here! front desk was rude| i asked for a small favor and they said mo,0
Really clean modern hotel close to airport.  Large rooms,1
Super clean during the COVID 19| amazing hotel,1
I love the room we stayed in everything was perfect,1
The room was spotless clean. The carpet did not appear to be as clean. The TV did not work properly. The front desk clerk tried to repair but was unable to fix.,1
Absolutely filthy and disgraceful accommodation. My room was disgusting| rundown and terrible. Breakfast was terrible too. Overall| this was like a homeless hostel level of standard. How can a business offer such appalling accommodation in this time and age is beyond me. Complained to the manager Jessica| she was on the whole: unprofessional. Never again!The only positive was the staff in the front desk: Francis and Marlon were very good. They deserve better gratitude.But the rest is a huge disappointment.,0
No house keeping | breakfast and I was charged the full rate. As a loyal customer I wasn't offered any type of discount. I am a paying and loyal customer.,0
Wonderful stay! Had a major surgery and needed a home away from home while we did pre op and after surgery! These folks are amazing and have made us feel safe and at home even 1700 miles away from ours.,1
The rom was nice. I couldn't control the slamming of the doors of the other guest though. Overall I slept good with my stay.,1
It was very clean and the area was great . Transportation was easy to get too üòÄ,1
This is an excellent hotel and great location.,1
The size of the room was larger and very clean. The only thing we wish we had was a tiny table and chairs so our family could sit and eat food since there is 650 sq feet of space it could easily be accommodated.,1
We had a great time here.  All the staff the we encountered was very friendly and super nice.,1
Very friendly and accommodating. Room was very clean.,1
Great location as the property is ~ 3 mins walk to the 39 AV metro station serving the N and W lines| room is of good size| liked the shower. However bedding is not changed everyday. Very close to LaGuardia Airpport| cost ~ $25 commute. In a nutshell i'd recommend this hotel and likely to to stay there again on my next trip to NYC.,1
The hotel had clean| spacious rooms with lovely views and a good breakfast selection every morning. The location was great for being able to jump on the subway.,1
Great location. Friendly service. Large rooms. Clean,1
We had a very nice experience. The front desk gentleman was wonderful. Very helpful and informative. Went to see US OPEN which made this a great location.,1
Great location| breakfast was good| room very spacious.  Only issue was the shower would not heat up two of the mornings.  Took over 20 minutes of the water running to get warm.  That is too long!,1
Like the close subway stations| short trip ride to the city.The area a block away from the hotel on 31 St looks run down if you walk towards La Guardia airport but it's safe. Walked it many times.,1
Great Hotel!! Customer Service is always consistent and dependable!!!,1
This was the perfect place for us. Subway station about 50 yards from the hotel| and local restaurants in walking distance. There's also a convenience store (bodega) at the corner of the hotel. Hotel has good breakfast and a balcony on the 7th floor. Parking can be a bit challenging. You will have to leave your car key with the desk clerk (parking are photos attached).,1
Convenient location| nice views and comfortable public seating areas.  Good value overall. Exercise area & self-service laundry.,1
Rooms were large and well equiped. The kitchen area was excellent,1
We had a nice two-day visit to NYC for my daughter's college graduation. This property is located steps away from the subway and minutes from Midtown. Great location! We needed a suite since my daughter had just moved out of her dorm. I'd stay here again!,1
It was nice to be out of Manhattan YET close enough via the subways. My longest commute was to the Hudson Yards which was about 25mins on the subway but compared to Manhattan traffic - that's gold! Also - it's super cheap to buy unlimited metro passes. A real convenient location| customer service was awesome and they even gave great foodie recommendations ... our favourite was Burger Club in Astoria :) Loved the view of the Manhattan skyline especially at night and the rooms were quite spacious ... by NYC standards. An enjoyable stay!,1
Conveniently located with easy access to Manhattan.,1
It is clean| appears to be new. The hotel is close the the subway| easy to get to. Comfortable bed and everything I needed for my stay.,1
Very clean n super big zoom| nice front desk person,1
The room equipment and appliances| staff| location....,1
The stuff and personnel are very nice and helpful.  The housekeeping staff (Veronica) always made sure our room was always clean and kept.,1
The hotel was very clean. My room was extremely clean and comfortable. Continental breakfast was also great.,1
I like that i was able to have 6 people in one room comfortably.  I like that the provide a big refrigerator and not just a small freezer box. I was able to keep my ice cream cake frozen in the freezer and still have gallons of juice and 2 liters of soda cold. The Complimentary breakfast was good. The food was hot and fresh| clean| and had a wide varity. ALL the staff was friendly and very helpful. Cable is provided with some free movies included but the movies were a few yrs old. However i wasnt able to stream movies i have from other subscriptions i have like hulu or Amazon prime etc. So my movie access to watch while i relaxed was limited. If there is away that they can provide some type of movie rental service of new movies that would be awesome.,1
Clean| comfortable and close to Metro. Would definitely come back.,1
Overall| it was a pretty good place to stay| and if we were travelling there again| I'd be happy to stay again.,1
Great would be better if room service was available.,1
This hotel was the perfect choice for our New York vacation.  There are 4 different subway stations within about a 5 block radius that make it very easy to get to any part of the city.  The closest station (only a block away) was closed for maintenance during our stay but it wasn't a bad walk to the other stations.  It was about a 15 minute subway ride to Times Square or a 25 minute ride to battery park to catch a ferry to the statue of liberty.  We purchased a week's pass on a metro card for $32 and were able to take the subway and bus system everywhere we wanted to go.  We flew into JFK on this trip and it took about an hour via the air train and then subway to get to Home 2 Suites.  The service here was fantastic!  They were very helpful with tips on places to eat| routes to take on the subway| etc.  Our room was very well kept and so comfortable with 2 queen beds| a sofa and kitchenette.  Plenty of room to unwind.  Breakfast was good and filling.  It does get very busy between 8:30 and 9:00 but we always found a place to sit.  Waffles| breakfast sandwiches| oatmeal| yogurt| granola and various pastries and fruit make up the breakfast choices.  The neighborhood is nothing fancy but we felt safe.  We did come in late one night and felt a little uncomfortable on a dimly lit street but never had any issues as 4 ladies traveling together.  I would definitely recommend this hotel for your New York trip.,1
I Will recommended 100%.,1
Everything was excellent about this hotel. Had family come into town for over a week and this worked perfectly. Staff was great| room was spacious and clean| complimentary breakfast and all day coffee was a nice perk. Location is convenient with the subway nearby. There is also a bodega down the street and some good restaurants.,1
Breakfast is so so good! Stuff is helpful and nice. However| the beds are not comfortable for sleeping.,1
Room was spacious and clean with a well equipped kitchen. Impressed with the kitchenette. The only thing that was disappointing was the lack of music speakers or smart TV to watch things on youtube. Many hotels are now catching up to current trends and offering smart TV in the room.,1
But my room was supposed to overlook Manhattan|it kinda did but didn't|I do wanna say the beds there are so comfortable and I was so tired I didn't care if I saw Manhattan from the window|right around the corner was a brand new parking garage I think it was 15.00 to park our challenger in it for the night so that was very convenient|Vince works at the hotel|he showed us how to use the subway and was very knowledgeable about everything|we appreciate you Vince I did get to see the Statue of Liberty |I give them a five star rating,1
No complaints at all. One block to the subway station (so close but couldn't hear the noise of it in my room). Beautiful city view. Spacious room (bigger than New York standards). Front staff made sure I knew how to get where I was going so that we wouldn't get lost during our very first visit to the city. Housekeeping even wrote us nice notes for us to see each evening we got back. I do wish I could remember all their names!! Would DEFINITELY stay here next time I visit.,1
Excellent place. Very nice staff.  A short block from the Astoria el (N train)| but the el was closed for repairs while we were there.  But it's just a few black to Queens(boro) Plaza| where the R| F| and 7 all stop.  Street parking was free and easy to find.  Subway lines get you to midtown Manhattan in no time.  Immediate environs of the hotel are an old warehouse/industrial district in transition to offices| residences and hotels.  Not charming| but just a few blocks from the main part of Astoria| where lots is happening.  Only complaint is that the couch folds out into a somewhat lumpy bed.,1
The online photos are accurate to the room we had during out stay.,1
I had an issues but the hotel staff resolved it in a timely fashion.,1
Well-designed new property in a rapidly developing Long Island City neighborhood just one or two stops from Lexington Avenue and 59th Street.  Clean| quiet| welcoming.  Big breakfast buffet.  Feels more like a highway motel than an urban hotel.  Lots of families.  Bed was a standard double| not queen.  Sofa-bed felt cheap| though we didn't open it.  Would return.,1
Great accommodations. The suites are perfect for families.,1
My entire experience was a 10,1
2 minutes to 39Ave N-Line | Room is great| I wish there is some lotion included with 2 soaps too. Bathroom floor was not clean on our 2nd night. Breakfast was ok| no bacon no sausage| just the frozen sandwich and warm it in microwave.,1
Fine hotel.   Committed| hard working staff.   I like the place and will come back.  But|  they really need to work on the HVAC system.   I have stayed in several rooms and the all have same issue|  AC is bitter cold| and if it's off| the room gets very hot and stuffy quickly.  Their thermostats wont seem to regulate the temp.  The range the thermostat seems to work on is plus/minus 10 degrees.     Best solution I have found is go for bitter cold AC and use the extra blankets.,1
I love the breakfast sessions it has a lot of varieties. The rooms are clean and customer service is great,1
Very accommodating staff. Hotel is clean and accessible to subway.,1
My overall stay this time was good. I've stayed at this location twice before. Staff is always nice| love the room| especially because it feels like home away from home. Free breakfast options are always satisfactory. My only issue this time is my guest who joined me felt profiled and uncomfortable when he came to the hotel. I wasn't present in the lobby to see or hear what went on. I received a call asking if it was okay to let him upstairs. He asked me in the future not to stay at this establishment which sucks because I love it there.  It's pretty unfortunate that one is frowned upon or looked at differently because of how they are dressed.,1
Clean| newly renovated. The only criticism is the hallways and rooms were too hot. After several attempts to adjust we gave up and just sweated.,1
Front desk was welcoming| at check-in and throughout the entire stay.  Breakfast included was fantastic! Lots of fresh selections and definitely suprised by all the choices. Staff was always keeping everything organized and stocked. The manager made a point to meet the guests|  nice touch!  Room was clean| fresh linens and towels and the kitchenette came fully equipped as reservation options described.,1
Affordable| cleanly| well lit| newer hotel| awesome staff. Neighborhood is growing quite a bit. A lot of new construction and remodeling. Some folks may feel a bit apprehensive about the area| but I never felt unsafe. Short walk to subway| can be in downtown NYC in 10 mins. I would definitely recommend this hotel.,1
room has everything required for a comfortable stay. Very convenient location to all the major attractions with 39th St subway at your doorstep. Breakfast was reasonable although it gets very crowded during the peak breakfast periods. Don't hesitate.,1
Service was great| location was convenient and rooms are spacious. All at a good price.,1
Only thing that we could complain about is the sofa-bed mattress that was not good quality (however the beds themselves have great mattresses),1
"The train transport made it easy to get around. Even ride share - uber|lyft was well priced and easy to use. They include ""continental breakfast "" but that included hot food with reasonable variety. Trays provided to take breakfasts to your room. We booked for 2 weeks and really benefitted from the self contained room instead of a small ""city"" hotel room.",1
The staff are really nice and sweet. You can feel they want you to relax and feel better.,1
The hotel makes you as comfortable as possible which is a great thing. The surrounding neighborhood however is not! There is a building being built next door and you are right next to Manhattan across the 59th St. bridge in Long Island city Queens so there is a lot of traffic in the morning. It is not worth it also to park your car or bring a car because the $30 parking only guarantees you about six spots and I can tell that they were over selling the tickets. If you choose the park locally on the streets you will be subject to meters starting at 9 AM and ending at 7 PM. And it's $.25 for every 15 minutes| you are lucky if you get a non-metered spot| welcome to New York City ladies and gentlemen. The local transit is right down the block which is a plus you can get to Manhattan in about 5 to 10 minutes.,1
Overall great stay.    Housekeeping never gave us soap for the four nights we were there.    Their was a little mold around handle in the shower| I found a dirty napkin in the kitchen area.,1
Loved it--was like an awesome apartment!!,1
Staff friendly and helpful!  Quite neighborhood with groceries across the street!  Good selection for breakfast!  Nice cafe nearby! Street a little dark at night!,1
Stay was wonderful - staff very pleasant and rooms very clean,1
Very nice and good service,1
Thank you for everything.  You made an uncomfortable situation very comfortable so she could rest and feel better.  Thank you again.,1
Very clean and functional.  The front desk| Francis| was helpful with local information.,1
it was good I'm very satufactory with everything.I dont have any commpain,1
great hotel for the price and it was very clean. I would recommend it to everyone,1
Really nice hotel 100% recommend close to the city.. awesome room,1
Nice and a very clean hotel with excellent staff and very convenient location (very close to the subway station).,1
I had an amazing stay at Home2 Suites| everything was to my liking| from the room to the customer service. Jacob and Susan were awesome! I will definitely be staying there again when I visit New York :),1
"Our stay was great but checking in and dealing with the lady at the front desk was a pain in the butt. She lacked listening skills. She also treated us like children stating excuse me there's a no party policy. "" Um hello lady I'm an adult plus it was New Year's Eve everyone was partying"".",1
The rooms were very spacious and it was nice having the bedroom and sitting areas separate.  Enjoyed the kitchen area also.,1
The night worker was very rude | hotel is beautiful though| close to manhattan| good parking| great stay overall,1
Hotel was very clean. Staff was very nice and accommodating. One block from subway so easy access to the city. Definitely would stay there again!,1
Definitely going back !!! Hughe rooms staff is great clean and comfortable,1
Great place| really feels like home away from home. Customer service also great!,1
This hotel was beyond my expectations. In comparision to all the local hotels in Manhattan this gem in LIC is by far the best hotel i've stayed at. For the price| you are definitely getting a huge room| almost like alittle apartment. I called to request a view of the manhattan skyline and the staff was kind enough to upgrade me without an extra charge. Their service was great. I requested toothpaste and it was delivered to my door under 5 mins. Very clean overall. There is coffee and tea in the lobby until late hours of the night| possibly even 24/7. This hotel is definitely worth every penny| i'd pick this over any hotel in manhattan hands down. Thanm you home2suites!!!,1
Started poorly. Hotels.com hadn't notified the hotel that I had booked a room. Took about 30 minutes to clear that up. Ended poorly too. Got stuck in the elevator with my daughter for about 25 minutes. The hotel staff didn't seem overly concerned. The rest of the stay was good.,1
I would do it again and again.  Everything was perfect| from start to finish.  Quiet| beautiful| clean| comfortable and convenient.     I loved the variety they have for breakfast| from waffles to omelettes| and different kinds of natural juices.   It was perfect.,1
"Room was good but that's the only thing. When we arrived at hotel we were told that there is a 100$ deposit that's needs to be put down on the room| which was never specified before booking. They also charged us a 250$ charge for ""smoking in the room"" because they found cigarette butts. Never smoked in the room we used the 7th floor balcony and instead of throwing them all over the balcony we took them back to the room and threw them in the garbage. Called and explained the situation and they said we were lying. Awful service and nothing but problems since the minute we checked in. Will not stay there again.",0
The only thing we found disappointing with the hotel was that there wasn't a bar to have a drink of an evening upon returning to the hotel| and they are also doing building work right opposite which is a bit noisy and annoying. But on the whole I'd definitely recommend the hotel and would stay again!,1
Terrific. We shared a room with our 16 year old grandson and with the curtain pulled felt very comfortable,1
Stayed 7 nights. Hotel accommodated change of room after one night because of adjacent construction site. Good size room with facilities of studio flat. Only negative is that it was a bit expensive for its rating and location.,1
It was excellent! The staff went above and beyond any other hotel that I've stayed at. I've been very fortunate to be able to travel and this was the best experience. I actually felt sad to leave-like I was leaving family. The breakfast was delicious. Many offerings. LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION! The subway was on the next corner. It was a line that went straight to the Bronx Zoo and straight to Coney Island and just as easy into Manhattan. WILL BE BACK!,1
Only thing not so nice is the only eggs for breakfast are microwaved (like airplane food) and the coffee is not very strong (but Sonja kindly helped me each morning with this).,1
Staff was great. Rooms were great. Only thing I wish they had was a pool.,1
We enjoyed our stay overall. Really nice staff and a great location. Only areas where we were not happy was poor sound proofing meant we could hear a baby screaming every night for 2 hours at midnight!. Secondly we requested a cab to JFK from reception desk and when he arrived and he wanted to charge us 65 Dollars. We got a yellow cab instead from the street and it cost us 45 Dollars.,1
It was a very nice hotel and the room makes you feel like you are at home with the little kitchen they have setup. It's also nice how the room also has all real cups|plates and silverware nothing is plastic and you have a dishwasher too.,1
Great room| great service,1
I had a great time with our room which was very spacious| probably due to the fact that it looked wheelchair accessible which was totally fine. ;) my only issue to be honest was that the room had a very weird and unpleasant smell to it which me and my lady had to mitigate with a fragrance spray that still didn't alleviate it. Aside from that| which we dealt with| we just wish the bed was. Little bigger. Overall though| the stay was as pleasant as could be.,1
Nice hotel near subway stop easy access to the city| weekend nights got loud hard to sleep,1
Stayed for 7 nights and thoroughly enjoyed it! Very modern hotel| helpful staff and free breakfast. Very close to subway station and pubs/food on the same block as hotel. Great experience!,1
We stayed in the hotel with our 4 kids and the experience was great. The staff is extremely nice| the room service outstanding and the commodities (playing room| gym| laundry| business center| etc) much better than most of the hotels we have been before.,1
Stay was excellent. Room was huge,1
Great location .... One block from train station .    Good  Continental breakfast,1
Still a little isolated in terms of restaurants nearby but there's a lot of new construction underway so I'm sure this location will be buzzing soon.,1
Excellent Room| Great View Of The City At Night. Excellent Customer Service.,1
Great price value especially if you are budget conscience but want easy access to Manhattan. Very modern decor and clean. Customer service was great.,1
very convenient business location near Manhattan| comfortable room for extended stay.,1
Friendly staff|clean room. Affordable & very accessible to train station,1
So glad that I found this place - reasonable| clean| nice people - cannot say a bad thing!,1
Beautiful hotel near the city..cozy and quite zone with cute little restaurants around the corner...definitely coming back!,1
We needed a hotel near my daughter's apt in Queens and near the subway| this one fit the bill and the January prices were good.  We were very pleased with the large room with a kitchenette| sofa and queen bed. Lots of room to move about and relax| very important since it was January and not so nice to hang out outdoors.  Our room was set up for a wheelchair user| which we are not| but I think it would be nice for wheelchair users| the shower was huge| and had a fold-down seat and bars to hold on to.  The surrounding area is quiet| although some new construction across the street may change that for a while.  The lobby and workout room are clean and pleasant| the breakfast pretty good (not enough fruit for me).,1
This is a pretty new hotel. Nice room. Very clean. Great to have fridge ETC. The one criticism I have is that the water pressure is poor. Also they keep the hot water a minimum temp so you really can't mix in any cold in the shower to increase pressure. This hotel is nice for a get away but if you are there for business and work outside or get really dirty at work I would consider some other place,1
The staff at the hotel were amazing and made our stay.They went out of there way to make sure everything was right.The rooms are massive and we had so much room for our party of five.The rooms are cleaned to a very high standard and we would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and relatives. The hotel rooms are full equipped kitchen area/microwave/dishwasher etc  which is more than we expected. The hotel is situated outside the city but this suited our needs and with the train station only at the end of the road its then only 2 stopson the train to the city which worked well for us.,1
Great stay| 1 block from safe subway stop| great staff and clean rooms!! New appliances and new installations.,1
Front desk staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The parking lot that they recommended down under the subway train is a little sketchy. Cheap| but I watched the fellow park my car| back it up into a fence and then open my door right into another car door. If you have A nice car| you definitely don't want to park it there. but the room itself was fantastic| the free breakfast is quite adequate| and the sheets are absolutely the softest we've ever stayed in before.,1
It was great staff was friendly. They didn't bother us. Offered breakfast during breakfast hours| a taxi| let us know what was available to enjoy in the hotel,1
A continental breakfast is offered every morning| close to two important metro stations| Queensboro and Queens plaza you may go anywhere from this stations. There are constructions going on in front of the hotel| but you don't hear the noise inside your room.,1
says queen sized bed| more like a full.. Other than that no complaints for just a one night stay.,1
Great location. 1 street from the 39 Av Station which is 10 minutes from Times Square. Very new hotel so everything is flawless. Big extended stay style rooms. Good for at least 4 people.  In fact room is equipped for 5.,1
What a great hotel! Not the best location|  but it's right by the N train station and just a hop to Manhattan. The staff is amazing and Jessica helped with our transportation to port.,1
I stayed here for 10 nights. I was vacation so I could see NYC for 9/11. The hotel was phenomenal. Free Breakfast was great. Rooms are in immaculate condition since its a new hotel built 2014| very artsy modern roomy and bright. The staff were so friendly and genuine esp Marlon| Nancy| Jessica| and Lily (housekeeping). Everyone else was also super positive I just cant remember all there names great job. I loved the fact that you had a full kitchen in the room. Beds were really comfy and also had a sofa bed with part view of Manhattan. Neighborhood is ok but your 1 small block away from train and 3 stops away from NYC. This is definitely the place to stay and not pay crazy NYC rates in old smelly hotels. Thank You you guys rock !,1
We stay for a night. we didn't expected a clean| nice| spacious quite room and the view..,1
Steven (or Stephen) was exceptional!!!,1
Ideal base for exploring the sights of New York.,1
A very short walk to the train. Only 4 stops and you are in the centre of Manhattan. Hotel perfect with free yummy breakfast (china plates and metal cutlery). Clean| bright and friendly staff. I would recommend it .,1
Great hotel right in Queens.  Very clean and safe area.  One block to the metro with a short trip into Manhattan.,1
Modern spotless hotel. Helpful staff. Easy subway access to Manhattan. Large suite is great for family of 6. Complementary breakfast. The only minor issue is that the breakfast buffet gets very crowded and not enough seating after 8am. I would stay there again!,1
Very clean rooms| good continental breakfast. Close to subway which makes it easy.  Clean laundry facilities and gym| will definitely stay and recommend this hotel. Great staff| very helpful.,1
very comfertable,1
Breakfast was just Ok.,1
We came to NYC for a Bachelorette party. We stayed at Home Suite 2 which was affordable. The location was great. We took the Metro one block over. Very convenient! The room was very clean and spacious. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again.,1
This hotel is easy to get to using the subway which makes it simple to get around to all the locations that you want to visit. Staff were very welcoming and accomodating. Would stay here again.,1
Really enjoyed the stay. Friendly staff and great facility,1
Put holds on my daughter's debit card for $2600...for $900 room...at same time held my credit card for 935 plus 200,0
Superb staff!! Excellent location..half block to subway in working class neighborhood. Good complimentary breakfast menu. Near groc stores and several small cafes. Nice linens and great room service. Would highly recommend!,1
In my over 50 years of traveling on business and pleasure| this hotel is in the top five. Everything| and I mean everything was more than one could expect especially for the price and location. two subway stops from Manhattan and only one block to the subway station. I would definitely stay here again when I am in New York.,1
Enjoyed the comfort and brightness of the hotel room. The refreshments in the lobby were much appreciated| and the terrace off the lobby was a great place to relax. Parking was an issue when we arrived. The friendly hotel clerk directed us to park in the Handicapped parking space and gave us a ticket to place in our car. It wasn't clear that there was a $25 charge until we got our bill| but it was well worth it after driving around the block three times with no success in finding a spot.,1
I stay for 6 night with my family|Good location near to train station| excellent staff and service. Good breakfast,1
We stayed eight days for family vacation and we liked this place since we don't really like crowded... Clean room and most of all stuff are so nice and helpful and easy access to public transportation....,1
The staff was friendly and informative. The room was large and comfortable. The room was kept immaculately by the cleaning staff. The surrounding neighborhood is run down| but safe. The hotel was well situated| a block from one subway station and perhaps three blocks from a more central station. There are plenty of restaurants and stores nearby| and many of the restaurants deliver to the hotel. We asked for and were given a room with a good view of the East River over which the fireworks display was done on the 4th of July. There were really only two areas where the hotel needs work: (1) The internet was on and off day and night| and was a real pain to repeatedly have to access; and| (2) Breakfast| other than the coffee| was basically inedible. We quickly located a nearby McDonalds and Dunkin' Donuts which provided us with much more tasty fare. We paid $25/night for parking which worked well| as free parking spaces were in very short supply in the area surrounding the hotel. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.,1
Literally 2 minutes walk to the subway using N or Q train will get you in 42nd street within less than minutes. Free coffee in the hotel was a plus since it was very windy and cold outside.,1
Room was large| spacious and clean and the staff were excellent and extremely helpful.,1
Hotel is beautiful| but a sketchy location.  Not what we had expected| we asked for a room on Long Island NOT Long Island city. Very disappointed with the area| actually scared to walk around in the evening.  The whole point of our trip to NYC was to be able to be in a area where we could walk around and such.  We had only a couple of days to spare| so it was very disappointing in this regard.,1
Nice| new| clean hotel near from metro station. Good breakfast. Highly recommended.,1
Great stay!,1
Fantastic staff & amenities! Hotel was spotless| facilities were great with the added bonus of complimentary breakfast. Location was not in Manhattan but the Metro station was two minutes walk away & only two stops to Manhattan. Would definitely recommend the hotel & can't wait to go back.,1
Home2Suite was very comfortable and convenient. Hotel staff extremely pleasant and accommodating. Great beds. Quick access to Queensboro Bridge to Manhattan. Not a lot to do in the immediate neighborhood. But if you are a movie buff I highly recommend a visit to the Museum of Moving Image at 36th Ave.,1
I had to be in New York to attend a last minute function. This property was exactly what I  was looking for| affordable and easy access to downtown without the traffic. The staff were very kind and responsive to any requests.,1
Everything was great no complaints will stay again,1
very clean| spacious| home-like setting. will go again.,1
we had a fantastic holiday. The suite was fab for our family and the facilities were great. The staff are so friendly and efficient. Perfect location near the subway which is ideal to travel to all the different places. We would definitely stay there again.,1
Everything was exactly as described and expected. Great location. Very good value for money. Great to have cooking & laundry facilities when staying for more than a few days. Breakfast could be improved with more healthy options (gluten and dairy free). Staff very friendly and helpful.,1
Hotel conditions are great!  The hotel staff people were very nice and informative with directions and helped us navigate the subway system.  The hotel is close to a subway station that will take you right into the city in about 20 minutes.  We stayed with our kids and they liked it to.  Super nice to have a microwave and refrigerator.  Breakfast was also very good!  I would recommend this hotel to anybody looking for a nice place to stay near the downtown area of new york city....,1
This a new hotel| so everything is in new condition. Room is ultra-modern in design and features. Ask for a Manhattan view. It is incredible. Only one block to the subway. You can be in Times Square in 15-20 minutes for $2.50. The staff is awesome. Very helpful and knowledgeable. Parking is limited| but if they are full| there are alternatives.,1
It was great! Beautiful hotel| wonderful staff| and the best continental breakfast i've ever had! Hands down this is the best hotel I've been to in the states!! Thanks Hilton!,1
We were newly weds| and stayed for three nights| i would've loved to have a late check out the morning after our wedding| asked the reception if that would be possible| but i only got until 1 pm.. a bit deceiving to be honest as i'm in hospitality business and know how it works..,1
The Staff of the Hotel is very friendly. They will help you anytime. Outside of the Hotels the are a lot of Restaurants and a few Bars| also Delis und small supermarkets are close to the hotel. Rooms are comfortable. We will come back. This Hotel is perfect for a New York City Tour.,1
A huge spacious room with everything you may need. Friendly staff (and I mean it). At first I was not so happy with the location but it literally takes about 10 minutes to get to the Central Park by subway. A good place if you plan to visit US Open too.,1
The hotel was new| clean and the staff very helpful and polite. The breakfast had a big variety of foods. Apart from standards| sth that I found convinient in the room| was the iron to iron the clothes. The place was also convinient| just 50 meters from the metro station and only two stops from Manhattan. No extra or hidden charges anywhere. If we ever find ourselves in NY again| I wouldn't doubt to stay there once more!,1
Built in 2014 so everything is brand new. The hotel rooms| breakfast| services| etc are perfect. The hotel has a gym as well. The surrounding area is a bit noise and industrial but the location is brilliant as the metro N line is very close and you can to Manhattan in 15 min any time.,1
Location is amazing| only a few blocks from the Path Newport Station. We stayed for 3 nights and the room was clean upon arrival. Our room had a mini fridge and microwave which was convenient. Parking is available on site| we used self-parking which cost about $27 a night. In and out privileges which is a great option to have as well. Only downside was that the parking structure was a bit hard to figure out and because it was not attached to the Hotel| it was quite a struggle getting all our luggage up to our hotel room. Overall| our stay was pleasant and we felt very comfortable there.,1
Close to all attractions and NYC,1
The area was convenient to area attractions. Was disappointed that WiFi was additional fee.,1
We were in town for a wedding a few miles away and this hotel was recommended to us by the wedding party. A recent renovation on the hotel was tastefully done.. and fabulous views from the room made it special and a delightful stay. With many restrictions at this time we felt very comfortable with our suite. It was modern very clean- with nice amenities in the bathroom. Two large screen TVs- one in the living area and one in the bedroom.At this time the hotel wasn't serving breakfast inside the building but there's a truck outside for coffee etc. delicious. There's also a coffee maker in the room. Soft towels and lovely bedding made the stay delightful. We will be back again. I highly recommend this hotelin Jersey City. It is near everything. There is a nice park to walk around| nearby. Many rooms have city views and that's special in itself. Look no further this is the place to go to. Hilton Hotels always make us feel welcomed.,1
It was nice room with the view. Layout is great| furnishings are new and modern. Room was very cleaned and we had maintenance daily. Bathroom though needs some update. Wats in the sink and the tub didn't drain very fast and you have to constantly pump it out. And there is no exhaust fan in the bathroom. Mirror gets steamy.,1
We were in town for a funeral| and the accommodations were very disappointing and disgusting! The room couldn't have been sanitized according to the cdc guidelines. There was hair| dust and dirt everywhere! And there wasn't any tissue in one of our suites. They also didn't serve breakfast! It was muffins and coffee with powdered creamer| no milk  or half & half,0
Overall|  the hotel stay was very good. I did ask for a cozier chair for my room. They only provided basic chairs. But unfortunately|  they were not able to oblige.Hotel is in great location near Path train station.,1
This is fist hotal since pandemic give me every day room service i loved other mostly give excuses covid 19 ....,1
Awesome hotel! Staff was super nice. Junior suite was perfect set up for my family. Short walk to PATH if your looking to visit New York City. Parking is on site but it is 32 a day and coming from Virginia where most hotels have free parking that was a little steep but we knew we were in NJ and that was to be expected just noting so everyone is aware lol. Also there is a 100 dollar PER NIGHT incidental| I only state this because multiple reviews state it's only 100 in general. Room itself was very clean and comfortable| had a great view of the city. Overall would stay here again when returning North!,1
Room  was spacious  &  comfortable. had all  the  amenities  you  needed. Convenient to  restaurants Parking  although paid  was a plus  in downtown.,1
Staff was great and the room was very clean and comfortable.,1
Would stay again,1
Nice size room.Bed was very comfortable,1
The staff was very friendly and made our stay a nice one.,1
Good hotel| great area. Near PATH train to the city. Great stay.,1
It was amazing!  Hotel is in walking distance to a mall with plenty of food options.  Just wish they had their cookies which were stopped due to covid.,1
We stayed 2 nights in this hotel| with two kids in a room with a separate bedroom. It was cleaned well| but because of Covid-19 I went over with sanitation myself and found many places where previous guest left their mark. Coffee (even on headboard over bed) | makeup on French doors and a lot of dust. But after a quick swipe| I have no complaints.Internet cost 14 dollars| which we didn't use. Parking was next door| 32 dollars a night. It is what it is. We found the garage perfectly okay. And even saw our car from one of the windows in our room.Waking up to the view of Manhattan or seing the sunset shine on the windows across the lake was our kids favorite thing. Would stay there again.,1
This place was everything we needed.   Clean and updated and close to NYC.   We didn't park at hotel due to reviews saying it being dark and cramped.  We chose to park at the south garage which is next to the Westin.   The Westin is next door to doubletree.  It was $29 for 24 hours.  For parking it at 10pm thirsday and picking it up around 5pm Saturday it was $59 bucks.  The garage was well lit and I felt it was safe for parking overnight.  We used the Newport Path train to get into city.  The train is about a 4 min walk fromHotel   It's $2.75 (one trip path ticket) to get into city and then you switch to the NYC metro system. We only stayed for 2 nights but didn't want the headache of adding money to metro cards all the time.  We got the unlimited 7 day pass for $33 and it was worth it as we used the metro to go everywhere.   Def got our moneys worth for just two days in the city.   So between the clean hotel with nice beds and good views and close easy travel to and from city  I would stay here again.    A great visit overall!,1
Wonderful location| wonderful staff| friendly| clean..we would recommend to anyone!,1
The man at the front desk was a little rude. Other than that| cool stay. The location was perfect.,1
I loved the cleanliness| staff was super polite and accommodating. The fact that it is withing walking distance from restaurants and across Newport Center Mall was a plus|It was a great 2 day stay and I'll absolutely return.,1
It was really nice the staff was amazing. It was so quiet,1
Modern rooms and great staff,1
Staff was great. Accommodated my husband and I with everything that we needed.,1
The property seemed very old. I stayed in room 1007 and the corridor outside room had bizarre zebra skin flooring which made the entrance to the room look ugly. There was no automatic light on/off system| you had to find light switches manually. Trash bins were small. Bathroom fittings were below par for a Hilton hotel standard. Room was not sound proof| you could hear noise from other rooms pretty easily. You need to be hilton honor member to access wifi but nowhere in the room was it written| had to call room service and then find out.Only good thing I found was the staffs| they were pretty prompt when called.I wouldn't recommend this property if you are looking for high class stay. I spent 360 usd for two nights stay and it was not worth at all in my opinion? Better hotels out their for such price.,0
The staff were very respectfully and kind. Any and everything I asked for they took care of it for me.,1
It was quiet & cozy. I was able to get some writing done| and have an evening of self-care.,1
It was a wonderful hotel| really recommend it. The only problem was the bed situation that was comfortable that was all.,1
Great view |amazing staff| and great area with a lot of restaurants  I will be coming back.,1
Parking on site.  The room was clean and comfortable.,1
Arrives at hotel and check in was smooth! Traveling with 3 kids and upon arriving in room pulled out the sofa bed which was filthy. Mark's all over the sheets so called for new sheets and blankets! Went to take a shower there was hair all over the shower walls. Left hotel to go get food down the street opened the door to find the room next door having a party. Random people getting off elevator on our floor to attend this party! Went to get in elevator to go to lobby and the weed smell was unbearable. Capped off this awful trip by going outside this morning for some fresh air. Cars parked in front of valet with people sleeping in them and urine stains all over the snow banks in front of hotel. Would never stay or recommend to anyone. Horrible experience at this hotel and did not feel clean or safe.,0
I needed to get away after being home for almost a year and needed to get out but this hotel was great  the room was super clean not one spot of dust or dirt. Front desk staff was friendly and helpful.,1
I like the hotel. The room was spacious. You had to park your car next door and walk back across the driveway. When checking in I was never told there was a parking fee and they never told me how to get back down from the garage. Thank god there was a couple that pulled up and showed me. While checking out I didn't know I had to pay for parking. I double checked on your site they were trying to charge me a couple dollars more. Then tried to tell me all of Jersey's hotel charges for parking. I had to correct her on that part.,1
Great stay awesome area so close to the mall and other attractions. Great staff from the front desk workers to the housekeeping it was all phenomenal definitely a relaxing smooth stay during a very well needed time. Only downfall is due to COVID restrictions the amenities and food court was shut down. FRONT DESK IS AMAZING THEY ALL DESERVE A RAISE FOR THE WAY THEY MAKE THEIR GUEST FEEL AT HOME,1
The hotel was very clean and in a great location in the city. The king size bed was comfortable me and the view of the New York City was fantastic.,1
Very clean.  Good stay.,1
We came here late at night to stay for just one night. Everything was clean and comfortable. Check in was simple. I'd come right back here in the future!,1
Had a very nice stay.  The facilities were great| the room was excellent and the staff were courteous and helpful. The only complaint was that the parking was difficult to locate.  There is parking across from the hotel but the signs should be more obvious.  Overall a great stay though!,1
Front desk was attentive and accommodating. Parking was a little bit of a hassle but ended up being fine. Really beautiful room and very comfortable. Staff was very pleasant| was greeted in the hallway by all staff which made me feel very welcomed and appreciated.,1
Room was very clean and comfortable.,1
I love the huge mirror that is in the room and it had 2 TV'S. I can't wait to go back! The staff was amazing!,1
Great and good location. Walking distance to restaurants.,1
Everything was wonderful|  beautiful view| . Excellent forme,1
The property was in great location for NYC tourist attractions. Very clean hotel. Friendly staff.,1
I had a great experience with this hotel. They were very accommodating| super friendly staff (special shout to Mildred| who was extremely polite and professional) very clean rooms| comfortable beds as well. The trip into New York City was convenient and quick with the PATH which was located right by the hotel. Overall| this hotel is worth the stay for the price you pay. I highly recommend if you're coming into visit NYC .,1
easy parking and access to NYC via shuttle to path train.,1
This is the 4th or maybe 5th time we've stayed here. Superb service especially the front desk team no matter what time of day or night you arrive. The rooms are spacious well maintained and clean! Parking is convenient at 27 usd with in and out privileges. There was a bit of glitch in the parking fee but they sorted it out after we called. And the chocolate chip cookies are a must try! Highly recommended!,1
I liked the organizations of the amenities and the service.,1
The entire staff was so very warm| welcoming and very helpful. Additionally| the fitness area was more impressive than those at most comparable hotels. The property was conveniently close to the Path train station and made our travels to NYC quite easy and there was a neighborhood restaurant as well as a grocery store just around the corner‚Äîa must when traveling with children.,1
Good service and so comfortable,1
We had a very nice time. Great location. Staff were very nice.,1
Very nice rooms| living room was perfect Staff was excellent,1
Another fabulous hotel| room and service from start to end.,1
The place was clean and staff helpful.  Only NON-issue was elevators slow and small,1
Juanita and the other staff were excellent and very friendly,1
Super friendly and professional staff. Perfect spot to stay if you wanna visit NYC.,1
It was a great mini staycation for us! definitely will come back.,1
Bad bathroom smells full of mould beds with blood stain used and management not even and APOLOGY never again never other location less expensive and clean not this one.,0
I was disappointed cause I was put in a handicap room and I'm not handicap!! When I ask for a change of room I was told that orbitz picked the room I also was charged an additional 30 dollars for a change of room The clerk was very rude,0
Check in was easy and the rooms were clean. . Beds were comfortable.,1
Not a Hilton that I know of. Do  not book this hotel. If you do prepare to get towels. pillows. coffee yourself from front desk that too .. they are stingy on that too. Better off to stay in Motel for half the price| They  have no staff to do things. Be ready to check in an untidy room with everything missing.,0
Very nice hotel and super nice staff would recommend to anyone!,1
The customer service reps at the front desk were absolutely exceptional. They went above and beyond to make our stay fantastic including surprising us with a  platter of cheeses| wine| and  chocolate covered strawberries for our family. We highly recommend this hotel for the service| location and cleanliness.,1
Excellent experience| friendly staff| parking was a bit expensive.,1
I ernjoyed everuthing about my stay at the Double Tree Jersey City,1
Nice clean rooms.  Would have like to have breakfast.,1
Property was clean and nice. It would have been nicer if they included ?breakfast and parking in the price of the hotel,1
Great location| clean| one of the few places around that also offers breakfast. That plus the availability of suites makes it a great place to stay with kids.,1
Very helpfull staff not always accurate with information missed the shuttle bus as told wrong time but keen,1
Nice rooms| beds very comfortable. Staff was very pleasant.,1
Great property,1
The property is close to everything and has easy access to Manhattan and New York sightseeing| shows| shopping| etc.Dendra was fabulous. She was very welcoming and went the extra mile to get us directions on how to use the transit system.,1
The room size is not comfortable| no proper welcome| it is not worth for the money we pay|Really disappointed.,0
This is a great hotel.  We will definitely stay here again.,1
Great customer service rooms were clean. Nice and quiet. Available valet parking no long weight,1
Wish they had more mirrors they were only in the bathroom and it was 3 women in a suite. Other than that good.,1
Convenient and clean. Staff is friendly and breakfast is delicious,1
We stayed at the Doubletree while visiting family in the area. The location was perfect for us| the hotel was very nice and our room was more spacious than expected. It was very clean and updated. We also had an amazing view of the NYC skyline. Everyone at the front desk was helpful and welcoming. If you are visiting NYC| this is a great location as it's very close to the PATH and provides easy access to all the sights. I highly recommend!,1
Double Tree By Hilton was exceptional| in all categories rated.,1
Christmas trip with our family to see NYC. Clean| easy to get around| friendly staff. We will stay again!,1
Great staff. Warm cookie on arrival and departure. Helpful staff with courtesy van to go within 1 mile radious. Warm rooms. Modern clean lines. Good shower. $5 bootle of water the only putoff.,1
great location and staff...they even dropped us off at a nearby brunch place...will definitely stay again,1
Nice location and close to NYC with trains available via  shuttle or walk to station.,1
Excellent hotel| clean| and close to training into NYC.,1
Nice area of town| not a problem walking around after dark. Staff was awesome.,1
Heater in room was loud and toilet backed up.  Bed a bit mushy too,1
Service was great| rooms were large and clean.,1
I paid $400 for a junir suite and had to pay extra for breakfast and internet. Weird that it was not part of the package. Hotel was short staffed. No robes in the suite.,0
The staff was amazing! Very friendly and helpful! Overall a great experience.,1
The only thing that could've made this an over the top stay was free breakfast!,1
It was clean| spacious room.Elevator stopped one.,1
Hotel is very good| room perfect| very clean | closet in not big enough,1
A block from the river and the river walk with great views across to the skyline of New York| particularly at sunset. This hotel is a good alternative to staying in Manhattan - cleaner| quieter and generally a nicer location with easy access to Manhattan by public transport.,1
Loved this hotel | very clean| modern| confortable beds| awesome view. We had a double bed suite in the 7th floor with ny city views spectacular. Front desk was most  helpful and cordial| only downside was the parking $ 25 daily but overall gantastic stay,1
The hotel room I was allocated was right near the Elevator and the room was not sound proofed properly as I hear the dinging of the Elevator all night.  I asked to be moved and they said they were unable to move me. If you do book this hotel make sure you are allocated a room far away from the elevator so you will have a peaceful rest.,0
Was a very nice stay. Its not over the top great hotel| but| I would certainly stay there again and certainly got my moneys worth. Room was large| half decent view of the river and NYC| didnt get to have a drink at the bar because we were too tired from a long day so I enjoyed the comfortable bed. Parking onsite with in/out was nice for $25.,1
We stayed in a suite with 2 queen sized bed. The room is big and the beds are comfortable. We indicated in our reservation that there are 4 people staying in the room. Upon check in| they only provided 2 sets of towels. Amenities lacked toothbrushes| toothpaste and shower caps.,1
The front desk staff were so friendly and helpful. I've also never had a hotel room cleaned so well| the housekeeping staff really went above and beyond.,1
Great Service At front desk...!!! Overall great service period. And the cookies....!!!!,1
Nice area.Perfect room for the five of us. Great hotel service. The shuttle was very helpful too.,1
It is convenient to the mall| grocery and transit.,1
Really nice room and liked the location- close to trains.  Nice area on the river.  Yummy cookies when we arrived.,1
Room was very clean. Staff was helpful. Shuttle was used to catch trains and ferry.,1
It was exacting where we wanted to be| close to everything in NYC but not in the city. The property was very nice and they even gave us cookies at check-in.,1
We had a wonderful time staying at the DoubleTree. The location was perfect and in close proximity to places to eat| the waterfront and access to NYC and Hoboken. The hotel was clean and comfortable even though there was construction right out our window. The light rail also went by our window| but was silent as it went by. The staff was superb and very helpful. We were greeted by Juanita at the front desk when we checked in and she worked hard to get us checked into a room earlier than the time posted so we could start exploring. Juanita also was very helpful during our trip giving us tips of places to go and eat. Top notch customer service!,1
Wifi on demand. Should be included,1
Really good location| easy to get to MetLife stadium and manhattan. The room was pretty nice. Liked the decor and comfy bed...but it's really cheap of them to not offer free WiFi in rooms though. It's 2018 come on...,1
Very good except for slow elevator,1
Loved this hotel.  Modern| fresh| spotless.  Easy access by PATH train to Manhattan.  Very safe| clean neighborhood with restaurants within walking distance.  No pool| but such a great option for a family looking to see manhattan without actually staying there.  I cannot say enough good things.  New york feel in room decor.  Great| great room and stay.,1
I haven't been there since they've made the upgrades.  I love them.  I plan on coming back again.,1
Staff was very friendly and helpful. Room was clean and comfortable. Great location and view from the top.,1
We felt like we were in Manhattan without being directly in the city.  The hotel was close and convenient to many of the places we wanted to visit.  I would recommend The Double Tree to any friend who wants to visit the sites in Manhattan or Jersey City.,1
My partner and I chose this hotel to get away and enjoy ourselves after a stressful work week. Unfortunately| there was VERY loud construction right outside of our hotel room that began at 8am. It was a huge bummer. We were never told upon check in about this major construction project. There were plenty of other rooms available on the other side of the building away from the construction as well.,0
Love this hotel and it's location! Beautiful hotel.,1
Due to flight delays we arrived late (after midnight). Staff was very helpful with a quick check in| letting us know of places to have a late night meal and offering late check out to catch up on sleep.,1
This hotel was chosen because it was close to the venue that my granddaughter had chosen for her wedding the hotel staff was especially helpful,1
It was a nice stay | I had two rooms | I ask but hotel was full so my two rooms was on two different floors but it work out well,1
Perfect spot for putting up a small crew that attended a family wedding shower in the area.  Clean| pleasant staff| and just what we needed.,1
Staff was very kind and helpful. Rooms were clean and spacious. great location| easy to get to many places including Manhattan.,1
We went there during the long weekend. The hotel lobby was crowded| especially during the check out time. The valet was a bit slow. However| the staff was polite and  friendly| and they tried their best to accommodate our needs.The facility is quite comfortable fo me. Our room seem to be recently renovated.,1
Comfortable stay| good service| friendly staff. I would stay here again.,1
Lovely hotel and huge room| stayed one night before a cruise.  I would definitely stay this side of the river gain for New York as easy to get across from this hotel by boat.  Not many restaurants in immediate area though.  Just a little itchy during the night so might need to change the mattresses sometime soon.,1
Fantastic hotel and fantastic service! Loved| loved| loved it!,1
Amazing rooms| great service| 5 mins away from restaurant/bar strip,1
No breakfast...,1
My room was excellent and very comfortable the staff was very helpful when I left my wallet in my room after I checked out .,1
The room was very clean and new| with all commodities. However| for the price we paid| there were a few small things that were quite annoying (we were 4 but there were only 2 towels| the bar in the shower was loose| ...). Also| I hate hotels that don't provide free WiFi. Housekeeping was super nice and friendly though (thanks Maria!).,1
We had a spacious corner suite which was great for 2 adults| a 17 year old and a 1 year old. We even had room for our pack and play.,1
Expensive parking| but good nonetheless,1
Just had a baby and wanted to get away for 1 night with the family. Upon entering the restroom i noticed a bedbug on the floor. I am completely traumatized as my 4 month old was sleeping in a playpen near the floor. What was suppose to be a night to relax has now left me with extreme anxiety thinking there might be a bedbug on my infants stroller or car seat.,0
The room was big and clean i like it.............................,1
The hotel is absolutely beautiful| the rooms are clean| the beds are very comfy| the staff is welcoming. Overall great experience and want to stay here next time.,1
Hotel is close to Hoboken and NYC. Also if interested in public transportation it's a 5 minute walk and u can connect to the world trade center and 33 rd street.,1
Convenient to PATH| easy to reach the city.  Plenty of room for 6 people| gorgeous view of the Manhattan skyline.  Staff is friendly and helpful| especially at the front desk.  Thanks for the great visit!!!,1
Beautiful location with a great staff that helped me with everything before I knew I needed help. I booked my room online and they had no problems finding my reservation and quickly got me to my comfortable clean room. Satisfaction is guaranteed.,1
Great space| staff| & comfort. Expensive parking for one night though.,1
Hotel was nice !!great location friendly staff and very clean.. close to everything in walking distance,1
The hotel was very nice and friendly. They allowed me to do early check in which was very helpful. The bed I used however was not properly cleaned for me and I found little black hairs on the bed. I do not have black hair. I went down to the front desk| as I had to go to meetings anyways| and asked if they would change the sheets for me. They apologized and changed the sheets for when I got back. The beds were very comfortable I fell right to sleep. The room is beautiful and would definitely stay there again. I couldn't give any other information about the hotel because I was only there at night to sleep and was unable to spend more time enjoying the hotel.,1
Everything was wonderful however everyone had a hard time with the elevators not working.,1
The staffs are really friendly. The room is very clean. It is perfect hotel for people come to New York city for the Broadway show and don't like to drive in the city. It is only two blocks from the hotel to the PATH station. The parking is good until 6:00pm after checking out. It makes sense totally.,1
Only thing I did not like was that my room had a sock & some other small article of clothing in the corner of the closet. Made me think they didn't clean very well. Other than that| the room was beautiful.,1
It was a wonderful stay. The hotel has such a wonderful room and the cleaning service couldn't be better. Impeccable! I recommend it to anyone.,1
Only issue with the room was our coffee supplies in-room were not replenished adequately.,1
Staff was very helpful. They were awesome. Best place ever.,1
wonderful staff and a pleasure to deal with.the rooms were very nice and the whole hotel grounds looked fantastic,1
Great place to stay convenient location. The staff were very friendly,1
Overall was a poor stay ruined by one staff member.,0
Would have loved to stay longer than one night. Hotel room was one of if not the best we've stayed in.,1
We enjoyed our stay. Everyone was very helpful. Cookies are always good too!,1
Good amount of space in the room and a reasonably short walk to the PATH underground train into NYC. Parking available but quite expensive| overall very happy,1
Expensive and old. The location is good. It is easy to take path to New York.,0
My only complaint had to do with the parking charge.  I don't think they should charge you to park your car when you're spending the money to stay in their hotel.,1
We only stayed one night.  the hotel was good.  it was clean| comfortable| and the service was good.  We had a bad television| which had to be exchanged for a new one.  That was done pretty quickly and efficiently.  I would stay at this hotel again.,1
Overall was very good| it complies with our expectations.,1
The stay was great| the staff superb.  What I didn't like was our Hotels.com experience.  First| I did NOT get Hilton points and this was not obvious in the material I read before booking.  Secondly| while they did get us a relatively low rate (remember this is the New York area and a very high quality hotel)| there were additional fees that approached a rate we could have obtained by our own effort or another service....Tom,1
was very nice| the stuffed chairs were worn,1
Service is excellent. Rooms are very clean and well kept. Breakfast choice catered for everyone.,1
This hotel was very clean and friendly. The staff was wonderful and the shuttle drivers were very kind/helpful. Watching the sunrise over NYC from  our room was especially beautiful.,1
It is a nice hotel| it was clean and service was good| except for the bellhop. We worked around him. Everything else was clean| and enjoyable.  The hotel shares a driveway with a condo high rise. This leads to some blockages as people double park in front of the Condo and sometimes block the access to the Hotel front door.  The self-parking garage is a little confusing and feels very tight as you try to drive thru it| but it is close to the hotel and easy enough to use. A lot of one way streets in the area| pay close attention to the traffic and signs.,1
Great except for one guy valet/door man who was so rude to us because I had to get locksmith for key to be made for my car that was lost,1
There was no heat and the tv wasn't working. I had to leave to go to another hotel at 3am. Unacceptable,0
Amazing! My only concern is the supervisor saud my receipt was send for email and at tbis monent i don't receive my receipt!,1
I booked another 3 hotels in NYC during this trip| they all were very good| this one was terrible| strongly not recommend.,0
Good hotel - polite and helpful stafff!! Nice larger rooms at a good price. Easy walk to train to go to city. Wifi cost!!! That is ridiculous!!!!! My main complaint- oh and the overpriced limited buffet!!! Instead walk 8 minutes to the City Diner for an AWESOME breakfast at half the cost!!!,1
Great location| clean| accomodating staff| close to shopping centre,1
- The hotel is not clean| particularly dirty carpets and bathroom,0
Check-in staff were nice. Cookies were excellent! Rooms were great. Always stayed with Hilton hotels group.,1
Went to the New York City area for the Macy Day parade and stayed at this location. For the price and location| the room was huge and very well appointed. The hotel and room were both very clean and well taken care of. Close to public transportation that made it easy to make it into Manhatten.,1
We stayed at the hotel for a quick weekend trip to NYC. The location is perfect (Walking distance to shopping| restaraunts and public transportation). Hotel was very clean and staff was amazing. We will definitely stay again!,1
Only thing was the Pillows were too soft and a bit uncomfortable. Otherwise the room was spacious and well laid out.,1
It is great hotel in great location. Path station was very close. It is very safe area.,1
The room is spacious and clean. The cookies are warm and very tasty! We would like to stay here again for our next trip.,1
Comfortable lodging| clean hotel and helpful staff.,1
A good hotel-convenient for my needs. Clean and comfortable.,1
Everything was beautiful| the hotel| surroundings and staff.,1
we ended up in a penthouse floor room| very spacious and clean| love the double tree,1
One night stay and I slept so good bed was comfy. But $5 for a bottle of water is really crazy.,1
We were very impressed with the service at the hotel| from the front desk to the valet parking.  My daughter left one of her toys in the room after we checked out and housekeeping set aside and shipped it back to us.  The room was clean and spacious with a separate sitting area and a pull-out sofa.  We particularly liked that we could shut a double door for privacy in the bedroom.  We enjoyed our stay very much as well as the view of the city from our room.,1
The was a very cosmopolitan area - upmarket with waterfront with great views of Manhattan. Easy access to NYC via Pathway underground ($2.75 each way) to 9/11 site via the new Westfield centre (amazing place - MUST SEE). Trains run 24/7. The Newport Mall in 5 mins walk from hotel or use free shuttle service. Great place to eat on the third floor. Our car hire place was nearby (Budget) and took the free shuttle bus. The supermarket is in the same place and great value for money to stock up the soda at $1 rather than $2. Oh yes - the hotel give their famous cookies !!!!! Kids usually get more if asked for. Really friendly staff and really helpful.,1
Friendly and Helpful Staff. Great location. Beautiful large rooms. Amazing value for the money.,1
We had  a nice one night stay with our family. We had a sound sleep. The beds were very comfortable | overall nice stay.,1
Hotel is hard to get to and a bit dated with the furniture in the living room area.,1
Short distance from New York City by car and/or water taxi.,1
Overall hotel was fine.  I called for a wake up call that I never got.  Love the Doubletree cookies.   Not much right there at the hotel| but you are in Jersey city.  Everything you need is a few blocks away| but a pain to get to.,1
Room and hotel location was great. The hotel gave a welcome cookie which was delicious but it was 310 calories. The parking was too expensive. The hotel should not charge for WIFI separately. It make hotel look cheap.,1
Excellent location| services awesome,1
Everything was good except the bathroom sink kept clogging up -- had to wait every couple of minutes for water to go down....,1
Low price,1
It was a comfortable stay.,1
The room was very clean and well lit.  The bed was super comfortable and spacious.  The pull out bed was used by our child| so it was accommodating.  The shower/tub area was spacious although the vanity could be a bit bigger.  We are a family of 3 and had bottles for this and that and it wasn't enough room.,1
Nice hotel close to shopping and path station.  Room was very nice and comfortable.  The staff were super.  They were extremely friendly and made sure everything was perfect.,1
Double tree hotel is totally money minded hotel where they are thinking complementary items are their wish... They aren't even giving the water as free. When I first checked in I asked any other rooms in top floor.. Receiptionist told me no rooms available and then once I reached room I realized the room is for two people and we are three| so again contacted them they said hardly they get another room for us in 2 minutes of time... And I am not sure how the receiptionist told me there is no room available for exchange few minutes back. Once I i formed their mistake about room they said their will exchange the room...as we paid 450$ for three days every customer will expect basic things like water and coffee as free||| they behave like the complementary items are their wish... Hampton inn and La Quita in hotels are very friendly and they would completely care about your stay... But double tree hotel won't care... Waste of money for this Hotel... Only good thing about this hotel is location...no any other things are good about this hotel..|,0
I was in Jersey City for business. I had a cargo van picking up network equipment. I couldn't park the van in the provided parking by DT. The van was to tall to drive into the parking garage. The Valet| Aide| worked with me and let me park in the valet parking for same price as non valet. Nice staff.,1
Stay was really comfortable.,1
good place| safe place| convenient to subway,1
The hotel was clean and convenient. Staff was friendly.,1
Spending Easter weekend with family. Great location to get to all the places we wanted to go. Loved the cookies too!,1
My wife and I stayed here for two nights; we mainly visited New York| taking the PATH train into the city in the morning and back later in the day. The DoubleTree was certainly convenient for that purpose| being quite close to the station.However| the beds were quite uncomfortable. There wasn't a quilt| and the pillows were some of the most uncomfortable I have ever encountered in a hotel.,1
Large and cozy room,1
"It is a very nice hotel with comfortable room and delicious breakfast. It is also very close to the subway station ""Newport""| which is really convenient.",1
Hotel staff was very friendly and efficient. The room was large| clean and comfortable. It was near everything that I needed. One minus to be aware of- the cost of the room went up almost 50% with the parking fee| hotel taxes and parking tax (seriously?). Other than that (with the exception of the parking fee) its not under their control.,1
My one night stay was very nice. The did everything they could to make my stay comfortable. I was very pleased and will stay again in the future.,1
Helpful and friendly staff; clean and comfortable rooms; easy to go into NYC or remain in NJ to shop| go to restaurants/bars| etc. Close to multiple types of transportation and easy to get to Newark.,1
Nice room and everyone very willing to help make our stay even better. We stayed here and road the Path train to NYC and back. Very nice to know we had a home away from home. Very clean and well taken care of. Security was also top notch.,1
1 night in a Saturday night. Great hotel.They let us check out after 12pm. The suite was great size| lots if space. The bathroom was ok. Standard size and clean. We liked that the temperature in the room was easy to adjust. Beddings were very comfortable overall. The hotel is not that grand from the lobby. The only problem we had was when getting out of parking garage the validated room key they gave us would not work so we were stuck at parking garage for a few minutes.,1
Prices are reasonable.,1
Nice stay,1
The staff was extremely friendly and made our stay very enjoyable,1
Easy access to public transportation| one stop/5 min to Carlos Bakery| and 5 min to WTC.,1
Employees of the hotel couldn't have been nicer and could not have done more to help. Rooms were comfortable and spacious. TVs have a great range of programming perfect when dealing with jet lag.,1
Relaxing and peaceful.,1
Great place,1
Weekend stay with friends. Accommodation was perfect. Beds were comfortable and walking distance to PATH station,1
Jose Morales the Driver did an awesome job during our visit. Congrats on the service!,1
My trip was for Business| Hotel was very clean and the staff was very pleasant to deal with.,1
Views over Manhattan fantastic. So close to the Path station to commute to Manhattan. Newport Mall also handy and a ShopRite just behind the hotel. Rooms spacious and very well appointed. We arrived at 2am in the morning and staff were helpful and aware of our late arrival. Courtesy shuttle to Hertz rentals also much appreciated. It was just great to come back to our hotel at Double Tree after a tiring day sight seeing on Manhattan Island. Restaurants close by plus food court at Newport Mall and good meals to go from the Shoprite supermarket.Would highly recommend this hotel.,1
Very Convenient Hotel!! Path system very close!!! Great to travel into NYC!!,1
I've enjoyed my stays at the DoubleTree.  It's comforting that the rooms are ample and clean.,1
Located close to PATH station to get to NY. Friendly staff. Expensive Parking. Comfortable room with great views.,1
good hotel but too costly for 200+ as they charge extra for parking and higes taxes 40 $ a day..,0
Excellent location in Jersey City.  Light rail directly behind hotel as well as one subway stop from World Trade in lower Manhattan.  Hotel has a complimentary shuttle in Jersey City.  Staff excellent as well as the room| comfort and mattress.  Would definitely stay here again while visiting the area.,1
Convenient for PATH train| although it was farther than it looked on the map but still an easy walk. Safe and quiet area. Great views of the city from our room| would stay there again.,1
had a good time| I would come back it s value for money,1
Nice Hotel| but staff was not helpful.  When I booked| I indicated that we would be flying in for a wedding and would like to get into our room a little early as we would have just gotten off a long flight and would have to be at a wedding for 6:00.  I received no response to this request. On the form for booking| don't put a spot for comments if no one is going to look at the comments and respond. When we arrived at noon| our room was not ready.  The confirmation that I had indicated that check in would be at 3:00| but was hoping to not to have to wait until 3:00.  The hotel staff said they would call me when it was ready.  At 3:00 I still had not received at call.  We headed back to the hotel| and they told me that they happened to have a room ready even though check in was not really until 4:00 (this was not the same information that was on my confirmation).  I understand that check in is not officially until later| but an attempt to accommodate would have been good.  Typically you have to be out of a room by 10:00| so there must have been some room available or close to ready.  We had to leave early the next morning| so we had the room for much less than 24 hours.  Not great value for $260 US.,1
The hotel staff were polite and luke warm. The room smelled like a hotel and had some stains on the wall| but the laundry seemed fresh and the toiletries provided were decent. It was just what I expected from a middle rate chain hotel. Would definitely stay there again.,1
We arrived late exactly as we said we would and they gave away the room we requested!,0
Wonderful stay. Took friends to see NY City and a stay in NJ is much better them the city. We will stat here again Wonderful view also. Great places to eat,1
The hotel and room were very nice and clean. Spacious enough for our family of 5. It did have double beds instead of queen - which was fine for us but some others may prefer queen size. There was a living room with a pull out couch which was perfect for us. The two complaints I would have would be that the elevators were a bit slow...there were only two that were for guest use and it took forever to get downstairs. Also there was an elevator in the parking garage that didn't work so we ended up taking the stairs with all our luggage when we got there. There was another operational elevator in the garage but we didn't know that when we arrived. Also| I got some conflicting instructions on how to access the subway/PATH when we wanted to leave. It took us a bit to find it. I think it would be helpful if they had maps/instructions printed out and hand them to guests when they arrive. We are not used to using this kind of transportation so that would have been a little blessing.,1
Close to the Holland Tunnel. Nice breakfast!,1
I thought it was a very nice clean hotel I loved my room and the view if Manhattan we ate at the restuarant in hotel was very good . Staff very helpful and nice,1
Hotel staff is very friendly| being in the customer service business i would hire this staff to work for me. Very professional. Hotel is close to PATH| within walking distance but hotel will provide shuttle. Did not have great view of city in our room but there are rooms available if thats what you want. I for one didnt need the view... i can walk across the street for that. Room was very clean| not even the normal hotel grunge.  Free cookies| and ice cold water. Resturant was very overpriced but so is any hotel resturant.  Will stay here next time| was very pleased.,1
We stayed at the Double Tree for a quick visit to NYC. We arrived early sp our room wasn't ready yet| but they held our bags for us while we went into the city.  The front staff was GREAT!  We were given very helpful directions and I would not hesitate to recommend this location to my closest friends and family.,1
Great location! The staff was very friendly and helpful. Asked a question about the train station and they not only answered the question but called the shuttle to take us! Convenient to get to NYC and half the cost. Just a couple of wear and tear issues in the room but otherwise a fabulous place to stay for a visit with the family to NYC!,1
The room was large. There is a shopping mall right around the corner| sufficient places to go out for dinner. The staff was super friendly. I liked the gym in the hotel.,1
Only stayed one night but will come back next time we are visiting NYC. Very nice and modern large rooms| close to train to take you to NYC in 7 minuts.See you again!,1
A lot of problems with the elevators. We stayed on 11th floor an often got a roundtrip to the top and to the bottom stopping in every floor. Took like 5 minutes to get from the room to the lobby. The housekeepers also used the elevators all the time with their carts. The front desk promissed thst our cookies should be delivered at the room within 1 hour after arrival| the day after we asked for the cookies but they did not manage to they delivered than either. :( Our room was not finished when we arrived| this we found out when we opened the door. Had to return to front desk and got another room. Not a corner room thst was ordered but in a higher floor.,1
Nice and comfy room. Staff friendly and helpful. Hotel is located next to shopping mall where you have convenient access to anything you want.,1
It was great to be there| nice hotel| near by everthing| they have  own free shuttle for their guest| great service.,1
Nice hotel| close to subway and boats to New York.,1
Just horrible.  The smoke alarm had been removed| the mattress was horrible (we both woke up with sore backs)| the safe did not work| both the restaurant and bar were closed| no coffee maker| and overall the space was dingy dirty.  This hotel needs a complete overhaul.  After one night we checked out early and moved to the AC Hotel nearly that was sooooo much better!,0
My only complaint was that the internet connection came and went fairly often. When I arrived I spent over an hour trying the get it to work over the phone with tech support. They were understanding. It still came and went though over time over my stay. Frustrating,1
Very nice place to stay in the heart of Times Square.Hotel was nice| and the city views were fantastic| but carpeting in room was soiled and in need of replacement and the hallways need to be updated. That said| I would still come back here because it was a good value.,1
Being surprised with the 23rd floor and such an amazing view on my first solo trip was heaven! The staff was kind| they gave me resources to find my phone when I lost it in the city| and were very friendly! The entire place was gorgeous and even more so in person!,1
It's a dirty place. Furniture is broken inside of the room. Windows are dirty. Area around the hotel is in terrible condition now| it was even gun shooting at night.. not safe| dirty... staff trying their best I guess...,0
Location was awesome|  front desk people were nice. No ammenities offered. We tried to switch our room higher for a better view we got a worse view and the room was way hotter. Even the 18th floor the air condition did not work well at all. The room she put us in was not a good view at all either so we may as well have just stayed lower where the room was a little cooler. P.s. the elevators high up are terrible.,1
The hotel room was very outdated and things in the room didn't work properly. The drain in the shower didn't drain and the drawers for the dresser were messed up. Room wasn't very clean,0
The hotel was nice but next time I visit It'll be at a different one.,1
Wish they had a mini fridge and ice| other than that it was perfect.,1
I was very disappointed that the room was not up to date like the photos online when I booked. Also there was stains on the furniture and carpet. The bathroom and handles needed to be cleaned better before arrival. Overall I expected a better view of the hotel room,0
Very close to Times Square. Our room was clean| no issues. The hotel overall is outdated and even if it's a non smoking facility there is a strong smellüö≠,1
Everything was excellent!!! The view is so nice and the location is perfect.,1
This is not 4 star hotel and i never going to purchase anything from orbitz again,0
Very poor customer service from the front desk stuff. They didn't even greet us. Shower wouldn't drain well| first day they didn't clean the room until the evening when I called for clean  towels. horrible view| the worst there was no coffee pot with tea bags  in the room as most of the hotels have| I get chronic migraines and I must drink caffeine at the same time every day. No microwave either. Horrible!! I was very disappointed!!!  When we were checking out I was in front of the line waiting to be called  until I realized I had to walk towards him or he wouldn't call me| then he barely talk to me| didn't tell me how I owed or anything  I felt uncomfortable and not welcome. Awkward!!,0
It was great to be there| very good location near to many service| area very safe| we feel very comfortable in this property,1
"Great location.  The beds were ""okay"".  Double beds| but this is the case in most hotels.  I wish they were Queen beds.",1
Gross. Lobby is super Nice‚Ä¶ then We head to our floor which looked like we were in a totally different hotel. Our room smelled like cigarettes| the wall paper was peeling off in some spots the outlets had no covers on them a layer of dust all over everything curtains and comforter had stains on them and the shower/tub was disgusting. Literally wore shoes In the shower‚Ä¶,0
Let me first say that this review is the truth.  Rooms are not good| very dated and carpets dirty with stains.  Pictures have been removed from walls and not replaced so you can see the former outline.  Our room had a condom (in the wrapper) left on the floor.  There was hair left in the bathroom.  We told the front desk and they moved us to a different room.  Same dated room without the condom or the hair.   We were on the fair elevator (farthest from the entrance to the elevators) and as we were going up it felt like the brake slipped and it went down 2-4 floors.  We actually thought we were going down.  The elevator did grab and kept going up.  The woman that was in the elevator with us will probably review this too.  We told the front desk and they said they would look into this.  Not a good experience,0
Good prices for the location,1
Customer service was great,1
This property is not good too dary,0
Very close to times square,1
Overcharged! The amount of money at booking was so much different from final amount taken off my credit card. The room didn't have tooth paste| towels were dump. Stay away from this hotel.,0
I'm up here for the night after the death of mt Aunt.  Just to relax and come to grips with the situation.  The hotel and room are great| trying to enjoy myself under the circumstances.,1
Feels like I'm at a motel. Do not recommend,0
Horrible hotel| dirty| smelly| 0 customer service| do not waist your time and money staying there.,0
I didn't like people being able to pass in the hall to change street even after 11hpm.,1
As soon as we went in the room we can smell the cleanliness and the view was great| just wish there was a fridge or microwave but besides that the stay was very pleasant,1
location is excellent| price is also reasonable| but it can use some renovation.,1
Our 3 night stay for family wedding was fabulous for this Bronx born girl! Bellhop Angel & Doorman Mark were so friendly| kind & helpful! Front desk & housekeeping & maintenance were great! We loved everything at the Millennium 44th street! Thanks| Marilyn & Chuck from No. VA!,1
Great location|  2 blocks away from time square. Theres parking across the street but you have to pay $60.00 daily!!!,1
The room where I stayed smelled like it was moldy and didn't have cups for water and missing cup. The drawers were broke‚Ä¶ the shower stinks,0
The staff at the Millennium were top notch.  The hotel was not.  Very dirty and dated.  The first room we were given had soda or something sprayed all over the walls| the bathroom sink did not drain and there was no mini-fridge.  We asked for a new room.  The second room was a bit bigger| but the toilet leaked| but we did have a mini-fridge even though we were told the hotel does not have them.  Location was good| but a very dirty hotel.,0
The hotel is not as up to part as it shows in photos. Stains on the sheets and dirty room.,0
awesome hotel to stay in.,1
Great hotel| friendly staff| paid parking directlt across the street. Carpets were gross dirty. Otherwise I'd give them 4 stars. Very good value for NYC. Wear socks| seriously...,1
Excellent service. The property could use a refresh of paint and general touch ups. However| Property is clean and in an excellent location. I would stay again.,1
The hotel is always clean and it has a good small.all.the time. Theur stuff is always there to help| room was clean and comfortable. The hotel is right next to times squares.,1
I love the location| staff and service,1
The location was ideal| smack in the middle of Time Square,1
Perfect and pleasure,1
The property needs updating| rooms were dirty| toilet leaking and paint peeling| stain on carpet| glitter on bed spread| went to talk to the Manager and it still took 3 calls afterwards to get clean blankets. Not a good experience,0
Honestly this was probably the most disgusting hotel I've ever stayed. We learned that during the pandemic this hotel that was previously associated with the Double tree Hilton (and notified of the disassociation a month before the trip) that our hotel housed a large population of the homeless. While I feel for people in these dire situations| The rooms conditions and cleanliness was absolutely unacceptable and disgusting. I do not recommend this property and I would not stay ever again.,0
The hotel has a great location|  it's walking distance from many attractions.  When we initially booked the hotel it was a Doubletree/Hilton so we thought it would have the same or similar accommodations as Doubletree even with the name change| but unfortunately they were the same.,1
Our rooms were gross and stunk like cigarettes| there was mold in the shower and around the toilet. Our sheets were ripped| carpet was stained and walls were dirty. We only stayed because we were unable to get our money back and couldn't find anywhere else day of. The only saving Grace was Sasha at the front desk| the housekeeping staff and the most wonderful bellhop who I am sure was the boss‚Ä¶ he had just come back from the pandemic| I wish I knew his name because he was wonderful. I do understand things are rough especially on the hospitality industry due to the pandemic which is why I didn't go full ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù but c'mon your hotel is dirty| time to step it up a little,0
The towels smelt terrible and didn't seem clean. There was no toilet paper in the whole hotel so I had to go buy my own| not something I was expecting to do while on vacation. The shower didn't drain and I asked room service to take care of it. They didn't! There was trash in the drawers when we first got there so the room was not properly cleaned.,0
"Property was great and very convenient to Times Square| other sights| hop on buses and other transportation. Restaurants were limited to mostly chains (McDonald's|  Olive Garden| Applebee etc. 'The Counter"" is a great restaurant close by.",1
It was extremely dirty when we arrived. The bathtub didn't even brain. The staff was nice| however had lied to us and told us they were sold out.,0
Rooms are nice and big for the price. Convenient location to Times Square and the Metros. But for the price small things like coffee in the morning should be a standard amenity.,1
The staff upon check-in never told us that we needed our room key to usethe elevator so we spent maybe 10 mins in a elevator before abother guest explained to us. Then the front desk told us that once we parked our car in the garage they use for discounts didn't matter if we parked more than 12 hrs the price is still the same. That was a lie. The hotel smelled like weed on the 32 floor. Room smelled like mold. There are so much more things wrong. Wish we did not stay here..,0
The cleaning lady was really nice and brought us extra soap,1
It was a great stay.  The carpet in our room was  stained| but nothing major.  Great location| and it seemed like the front desk staff was holding up COVID protocol.  All together| we enjoyed our stay.,1
Over priced. This property is outdated. The room was dirty and had stains all over. Including the walls| bedsheets| and curtains. The refrigerator was gone. No way to store and keep drinks/snacks cold and the ice machine room was not available. I wouldn't stay here again.,0
The location was great. But the room was not clean or well maintained.  Nowhere to sit in the lobby| no dining or food at all in the hotel.  Overall we were not impressed.,0
My TV was broken and they claimed every room was booked up. They did knock off some money| but we sat in silence the rest of the trip,0
They even lets check in early the 4,1
The location was fantastic. The staff was friendly. The hotel needs some major updating. We tried three different rooms before we were happy with our room. The first one smelled like smoke and was dirty| with the bathroom ceiling caving in from water damage. The second room had mold all over the bathroom and awful stains on the carpet. It had not been cleaned very well either. The third room had an amazing view| but had someone's old food in the fridge and the lights didn't work half the time. It looked like the carpet behind the bed hadn't been cleaned in years. This property needs some major updating. We actually almost cancelled and moved to a different hotel the minute we walked in. The phones don't connect to any hotel services either. They just ring to nowhere. They gym was nice. No guest laundry facilities. Honestly| look elsewhere. You will be disappointed. When we were checking in| the person next to us was complaining about the condition of their room.,0
Great stay!!!  Will do Millennium Hotels again,1
It really was very nice and not expensive,1
The  carpet has a lot of holes| the bathroom some dark mold specially the shower. Tv is not working. The window can be open by a toddler. If you have kids better get a better hotel that the window is safe for kids.,0
I can't believe there was mold in the restroom we tried moving to another room and it was in worse condition. Staff was amazing and respectful,0
"Great location for a low price.However| the hotel leaves a lot to be desired. It feels very outdated as evidenced by the peeling wallpaper the moment you step off the elevator| to the loose bathtub faucet or stains across the carpet. The rooms do not look like the hotel-provided photos. The bed was very firm| the pool remains closed because of covid| and the ""breakfast available"" indication merely refers to the fact that there are restaurants nearby in Times Square -- there is no available restaurant or food service in the hotel.",1
Location to Times Square was good| but the hotel was a bit rundown. Time for an update.,1
Hotel is in a great location.  Staff is lovely.  Hotel is weathered and could use some TLC.  Short stay| so location was paramount.  Good to be there!,1
I enjoyed my stay here. Check-in was relatively easy. The staff was very nice and accommodating. And the hotel is in a great location. We were able to walk to most of the places we wanted to visit.,1
The room they had us check into had not been cleaned by housekeeping. Dirty towels were still on the floor and beds. They immediately gave us another room which we found dirty wrappers on the edges under the bed (was afraid to look further) and a zip lock bag of what possibly could have been old peanut butter in the corner of the room by the bed.,0
No storage baggages service for customers! As a tourist| it's not convenient at all.,1
Great room|  great holtel fitness center| it was overall very good,1
Need to remodel,1
The one thing i like was the proximity to times square the main reason for staying there| the thing im most disappointed with is the room we ware assigned| i booked a premium room with a city view and i didn't get a premium room and i had the view of a wall my whole stay needless to say i will never stay in the same hotel again| the staff made no effort to accommodate my request nor was i given any type of discount for theyre short coming,0
Great location| below average property. They do r hold luggage. Never even occurred to me to ask because I have never encountered a hotel that didn't offer this service. No shampoo in bathroom. Shower got to lukewarm at best.,0
"This hotel was FAR below standards.  The original room we received upon arrival was gross| nasty| dirty| stains on the walls| dusty...we were scared and it felt unsafe. We complained and was moved to another room that was cleaner but also had issues. The phone didn't work|  toilet wouldn't flush properly|  television kept going off| the room was sooooo small|  the ""Ball View"" was a joke and to add insult ro injury they charged us for daily hotel fees after telling us there would be no charges.  The hotel has the look and feel of the hotel from American Horror Story..accept AHS hotel at least had an open restaurant bar. I would not ever recommend this place to anyone.",0
Positives:  Management was polite and accomodating when we asked for early check in and a late check out.  There is strong police presence in the area.The location is wonderful for subway transportation| shopping| fast food| coffee| and a Walgreens is located next door to the hotel.Negatives:  Room service is available| uoon request. We requested room service (or at least clean towels) everyday for our stay. We stayed a total of seven evenings and only received room service for four of the eight evenings.  We had to call each of those four nights for clean towels. The beds were extremely hard and the thermostat did not properly work. Our room stayed at 65 degrees and we were unable to change the temperature.  Engineering was supposed to fix the thermostat| however| it only properly worked for one day.The carpets in the room were very dirty and the pictures displayed of the rooms make the rooms look much nicer than they are in person. Hot water for showering were not consistently available in the evenings. Most evening nights| we took lukewarm showers.,0
Wish there was a mini fridge,1
shower was dirtyAC was not working|keys needs to be replace constantly as they easily erasesmall rooms,0
A nice hotel steps away from Times Square. The beds were very firm - if you like that...  the towels seemed very clean and fresh. The TV was nice but the WiFi was rather slow. Overall| a great value.,1
Good place| near shopping| walking|Restaurants and Good clean room,1
From the start‚Ä¶. No areas to wait in the lobby while checking in| no bag storage before room check and after check out. Immediately upon entering the room| hair in the bathroom sink| floors filled with filth and bugs on the wall. Issues and delays with getting my refund.,0
Very old hotel. Dirty carpets. Old bathroom| broken lamps. Only good thing is location,0
staff went above and beyond to accommodate when door would not unlock with keycard. had a new room in minutes. even though it was a lower floor. the room on the other hand was not good. stains on the floor stains on the end table water damage in the bathroom wall and ceiling. poor repairs around the room.,0
Is comfortable My expectativa for the room is good,1
Right in the heart of Times Square. This hotel was exactly what I needed. Exit toward 44th Street and you're right in front of Good Morning America. Exit toward 45th and ta-dah you've got shops like Disney Store and Old Navy just steps from your door. Literally takes a single minute to be in the middle of Times Square from the hotel. We had a room on the 27th floor. We could see most of the ball drop apparatus from our room. My sister's room a few doors down was the corner room with a perfect view of the ball drop AND the Empire State Building. Close to the subway entrances (42nd St and 45th depending where you were headed). Check in was quick and easy. Housekeeping brought up extra towels pretty quick. Room was clean. Beds were comfortable. Only thing missing was a refrigerator but it's not a deal breaker. I will definitely be looking to stay here again on my next trip!,1
Best experience ever in this hotel the stuff is really awesome,1
It was disgusting. It smelled like smoked| the office chair looked like it came out of a dumpster| there was dust everywhere. I hated it| never again.,0
Continued‚Ä¶ After our first night ‚Äúroom service‚Äù tried to open our room door TWICE. Thankfully we had the security lock on. My family nor I will be returning to this hotel. It is not well kept| dirty and outdated. What it does have is a great location at the center of time square and accessible to all things tourists like to do and see.,0
The expectations had for this hotel were high due to its great location in time square| however the experience my family had was not please (it was their first time in NYC-TimeSquare).First| I had to call the hotel to add a day to our reservation since we were arriving a day early. The reservation agent from the hotel commented ‚Äúthey usually give those who book through a third party website whatever room is available| not what they select on the website‚Äù when I asked to add a day to my reservation in the room previously booked or to upgrade my room as I was willing to pay extra. In the end I had to do a second reservation.   When I arrived to the room after checking in. The the room was NOTHING like the photos| nor was it the room I had booked. The room at first glance had a dirty carpet| the walls were dirty| the furniture was not well kept| the closet was broken and the bathroom was poorly kept. I then walked out of the room and requested a new room. The second was in the same conditions| at this point. I was frustrated because this would be the first impression my family will have of the city. After speaking to my family they decided to stay and not check into another hotel since they were tired from traveling 15 hours. When requesting a change of room the front desk agents were not pleasant they questioned WHY and I told him it was due to cleanliness and state of the room| he proceeded to an attitude and an unwelcoming demeanor.Continued‚Ä¶.,0
Nice place to stay good costumer service and clean rooms,1
never want to go there again,0
Overall its an ok place at best. Our room was clean| but the cabinet door was off the hinge| there wasno vent switch inbatheoom and the paint was bubbled from condensation. There was no mini fridge even after i requested one be brought to the room. I would probably try another hotel for our next stay before returning here,0
Staff and their manager were both bad. Room was full of dust and I fell sick. I had cold| cough and fever during our stay there.We were supposed to get a room with city view and were charged extra for that. We got a roomthat had no view| except the buildings on the other side of the road.We were also promised complimentary breakfast as we paid for a top floor room| but no breakfast was served.We were promised that our luggage will be kept safely on the last day of our travel while still go around until evening| but they did not rather wanted me to pay extra if we have to leave our luggage with them. The whole experience of staying here was so bad and will never recommend this place to anyone.,0
Had a great stay| room was great| perfect location‚Ä¶very central to a lot of great food| will def come again‚Ä¶only negatives were a bulb out in the bathroom and the tub after my shower not draining very well| but totally minor‚Ä¶again| loved my stay here for four days| I will be back for sure!,1
Very bad experience,0
It was clean and quiet,1
The view was amazing but the cleanliness and staff assistance was horrible. The bathroom had someone's hair all over the walls. The TV in the room didn't work in which we called multiple times about and kept getting disconnected. My husband went downstairs to talk to someone and came back to the room with someone from maintenance| just for him to take a look and say that he'll be back and never came back.,0
Room and bathroom very clean nice hotel,1
No shower curtain in shower| no breakfast| no restaurant| no fridge| no kettle for coffee nor tea|no rope. No concierge old carpet| old beds| terrible view to walls in other old build8ngs| old equipment.shame on you Expedia!,0
Everything reasonably was good|,1
Hotel is ideally located in midtown close to transit. The rooms are small and dated| but they accomplish what most tourists need. Room cards are problematic when it comes to elevator use.Like many hotels nowadays| you need to tolerate some boisterous fellow guests late at night and marijuana smoking.Amazing views of NYC's dense urban fabric.,1
Hotel was nice. Clean. Not the most fabulous looking hotel. Great location though!!! Step out right to the Times Square. If you want views| make sure to choose the room that offers views!!! Most of the rooms do not provide the great view people look for. Front desk is very helpful. Especially Kayla!!!! She helped me to swith the hotels from next door Millennium Premier to Broadway. And helped me to reserve a room that had a view to a Time Square. Overall|  enjoyed the stay. Qill definitely come back| just will make a better oom choice,1
This hotel is not ready for guest. Way under staffed| no room service | no food in hotel| tv in room did not work (  5201)| cable had been cut and staff had no supplies to fix it| room would not cool down in the afternoon| got so hot we had to leave. One staff member was good enough to find us a fan later in the day. Was hard to reach management and when we did they were not helpful or seemingly apologetic. Even several staff members said management was bad. I  would like to be compensated for a horrible experience. Paid a lot of money for this room.,0
Looking at the pictures and the description I thought this would be a pretty good hotel. Good thing| parking is across the street| hotel entrance seemed nice| elevator line‚Ä¶ long going up and back down. The room.. old.. view not as described.. there was no view but a ledge with trash out on it. The room had a smell| the AC did not hardly cool the room| the mattresses‚Ä¶ HORRIBLE and small.,0
Time Square is always amazing but the hotel is located in just the right place; at the edge of all the excitement and close enough to relaxation (short walk to waterfront-westside).,1
The customer service from At the front Desk her name is Sue she was excellent,1
My wife and I stayed there about 11 years ago and it felt like a first class hotel.  This time we took our kids and the rooms are falling apart| Dirty| smelled really bad and decor is as it was 11 years ago it has not changed. We would not even let our kids walk barefooted because the carpet was so dirty.  The location is the only thing that has going for it. DISSAPPOINTED!,0
The location can't get any better and the staff were very friendly. The room was great for the price.,1
The property did not look like the hotel we booked and we booked a hilton and it changed ownership prior to our trip. The room smelled very badly of cigarettes and was clean but very outdated. Bathroom had no fan| no lock on door and the sink had a moldy trim. No fridge or microwave in room. Location was great though.,1
Carpet was nasty and the bathroom had mold. Also the whole hotel smelt like marijuana.,0
I honest didn't like anything about the property.,0
The stuff was nice. There was no security,1
The hotel do not provides any luggage storege service. There is no loby so if you arrive early or checking out late you are stuck.,0
H√¥tel was plain| but sufficient. Clean and a good value.,1
After traveling all day| I finally arrived at this hotel around 11:40pm to find out they gave away my PAID hotel rooms to someone else. What made it worse is that Daniel just went to the back without any explanation for about 30 minutes leaving us stranded in the lobby with no one helping us. The other employees that were there refused to help as well. Nicolas finally came out and explained to me that there were no rooms available and offered another hotel room 9 blocks away. Me and my kids had no other choice so we had to walk through NY city at 12:30am just so we wouldn't have to sleep on the street. The entire time this hotel staff was not even sorry about their mistakes and actually rude. Nicolas offered 1 night refund for 1 room when I asked but hotels.com doesn't even see that. This hotel cannot get anything right and they are a disgrace to the Hilton brand.,0
The description does not match the property. Nota full service hotel. The room with a view did not have view. Shower was not working properly. Charged twice for room.,0
The check-in was a little delayed due to computer issues| but the staff was very helpful once everything started back up.  Not many extras in the room - mini fridge| cups| coffee maker but it was clean and comfortable.,1
Check in and check out are crowded with long lines. Didn't like the one front desk clerk who refuse to slpit my payment on two cards but the other front desk had no issue. Don't belive it was policy because more than one front desk clerk said rhey didn't understand why he wouldn't do it. But overall it was a pleasant experience.,1
We spent two nights and more than two days| but there were no cleaning service in the room.,1
i didnt like elevator system to much confusion,1
great location hotel service was excellent,1
Liked the location| staff was friendly. Didn't have a coffee maker in room so I was going to Starbucks for coffee. Last day I found out they would've brought a coffee maker to my room if I had asked for one. Very nice hotel and is pet friendly.,1
Unfriendly service | dirty around hotel | noisy loud environment| terrible experience| will never stay here again,0
Ive stayed,0
We checked out around 10 then around 30 mins we realized that my boyfriend left his earring and hat in the room we retired around 10:45/11 am the staff escorted my boyfriend to the room since the reservation was under my name and I wasn't able to return to the hotel with him. Upon arriving to the room the cleaner and was still cleaning making the bed up as they arrive the hat was gone and the earrings were gone. Immediately my boyfriend and the security starting checking. We specifically left the hat on the couch and earrings on the night stand. All of a sudden they are missing and the only other person to have entered the room since us leaving was the cleaner so naturally the security asked the cleaner did she see the items and she said no. Which doesn't make sense cause we know for a fact where we left them and they were no where on our person my boyfriend would've automatically put the earrings in his ears and hat on his head if he rembrfore we left since we were in a  hurry. The staff were not helpful in the investigation besides the security guard Al the cleaner definitely stole the earrings since the hat was returned to us after the security guard returned to talk to me downstairs once I was able to return to the hotel. We have yet to hear anything these warring aren't cheap and no one seems to care. The cleaner wasn't held accountable and we were led to believe that there would be further investigation but since no one has contacted us or returned the items.,0
The location is extremely convenient for catching your buses| taxis| and walking to points of interest. The hotel is safe and a room key must be shown to a staff member before entering the elevator area and the room key is required to use the elevator. It is an older hotel but still nice. The bathtub was the only obvious sign of the age of the room. Overall it was clean| comfortable| and convenient.,1
Had a great time. Perfect location!,1
Checking in took at least an hour even without any line to wait in.  Front desk staff had to go ask questions to manager 4 separate times.  After finally figuring things out even though I gave them my reservation number they told me I would have to come down and check in again tomorrow.  The rooms have not been updated since probably 1970 with very very worn out beds| pillows| and everything else.  The rooms dont even have a microwave or a fridge.  The drain stop in the tub was broken.  The room was worse than what I would expect at a 1 start place.  The location is perfect but everything needs updating from the staff to the rooms.,0
Staff was rude first room given was still dirty water on the bathub towels on the floor mold on the bathub phone did not work called the front desk from my own cell phone and was rudely told to go downstairs and talk to the guy should I go on? Never staying here again,0
Mg hotel room had bed bugs and my other room smelled like cigarettes,0
My friend and I both stayed in this hotel. Both of our rooms had mold and had to be switched to different rooms. Carpet was super dirty. There is no fridge and blow dryer did not work. The only positive thing about this hotel is the location. Other than that| I will never stay here again.,0
The property needs some maintenance and more cleaning| the bathrooms look like they are not clean well enough. The property smells bad.,0
My hotel room was not clean especially the bathroom (mold and hair everywhere). Beds and pillow where not comfortable.,0
They advertised a sofa bed. The staff said they got rid of their sofa beds and gave us 2 rollaway beds. The Rollaway beds were awful. Extremely uncomfortable and felt like you were sleeping on metal springs.  We requested the Rollaway beds at check-in at 4pm. Called Front Desk at 8pm to remind about Beds. Didn't receive beds till after 9:00pm|  Initial Reservations were made for 4 people.,1
The hotel has an amazing location everything is close the subways| central park | bus tours,1
My first night there my tub got clogged up after that the toilet- I literally had to keep going to the desk to get new key cards because mine kept deactivating and they were not around anything- last day there I had a question about my key card not working again and was in a rush so to my lift arriving to take me to the train station the women with blonde hair was so rude to myself and another guest! I will be calling the hotel this week very Unacceptable,0
It is highly misleading online. DO NOT get the skyline view. Your view will be a wall or maybe a building or two| not the skyline. The original room smelled like cigarettes and the view was one building. When we asked to be transferred| front desk transferred us to a queen size room where there was no mini fridge for the things that we bought. The view was misleading once again and we originally paid for a king| not a queen. When we went back down| the staff was very rude and told us that they had no other option for us because they needed to leave the ‚Äúgood‚Äù rooms for the people that were checking in later that day. After putting our foot down| they transferred us the following day to a better room with a view of Times Square| however| that day and the rest of the weekend| the air was broken in our room| and many others. It was problem after problem at this hotel. Don't stay here.,0
Room was average| front desk was slow| key card didn't work a few times| toilet broke and took over 8 hours to fix| early check was $50 so not too bad & location is good,0
Location is A plus,1
Bed was very firm and stiff,0
The bed was a little too firm| but good location and views. Hotel was secure and beautiful lobby.,1
Basic room amenities did not work| as some of the lights| safety box| and tv signal.,0
The room was dirty| smelled like marijuana smoke coming through the vents| no furniture in the the lobby to wait for a taxi and the check in staff was rude.,0
Carpets were stain at the rooms but overall everything was working good and safe everyment,1
"My time at the Millennium was not at all enjoyable. The pictures on Expedia's site are quite manipulative. The pictures I saw portrayed this hotel as luxurious| interactive| and most importantly clean. The Millennium Hotel was far from clean. There was a smoker's stench in my room--primarily in the carpet. The carpet had visible stains along with the linens there were on my bed. There was a lack in receiving ""cleaning"" service from Housekeeping in this particular hotel. There was a struggle for the hotel staff to answer the phone just so that I can obtain clean linens. My friend who stayed with me has quite a few medical issues. One of his major health alignments is diabetes. My friend uses Insulin to treat his diabetes. There was NO REFRIGERATOR in our room for him to house| to keep his Insulin shots cool. That not only is irresponsible but should be viewed as a liable action. I urge anyone who reads this review to not book with this hotel because I thought I was going to a luxurious stay and it was not.",0
Unhygienic place to stay,0
The hotel staff was totally unprofessional and grumpy. Whenever i requests something| they just repeat that the hotel is for business trip so they have NO service i.e. hodling lugguage for travelers. I had walk 10 mins with 24kg luggage to store it since the hotel refused to hold.Wiredly the hotel provide the luggage store business card where the place also provides such a terrible customer service. Terrible hotel experience in my life ever.They are no longer operated by Hilton.,0
I will never stay at that hotel again when visiting NYC. The hotel is just to overrated. It is not worth the price for the rooms.,0
The view,1
I stayed hear many years back and was very pleased. This time I was very disappointed. Check in was slow and very backed up for as many desk people they had. I requested a ball view room for my wifes first time to NYC. The room did have this view but also came with a non working tv and badly stained carpet. After asking several times the tv couldn't not be fixed. They where unable to move us to a different room till morning. The new room did not have a ball view that we paid extra for and there was no refrigerator like our first room. I was very saddened and disappointed in how the staff handled these issues. Will be sure to stay some other place next time.,0
Rooms outdated and furniture has lots of wear and tear. Considering the hotel rating and the premier room we thought we selected we were disappointed. Bathrooms were not cleaned thoroughly and had hair. Thankfully it was a quick last minute stay and we didn't spend too much time in the room. The city view was okay. Location is perfectly located in times square. Everything is around the corner.,0
The comforter was dirty. It had dry food on it. I had to request bed changes. There were no bath towels. It was ok but I thought it would have been better.Someone left discarded food right in front of the elevators on the 29th floor. I told the concierge nightman but it was still there when got ready to check out at 5am. I told the gentlemen at the front desk that the discarded food was still in front of the elevators on the 29th floor.,1
Common area and the room are clean. The room and ameneties are very basic compared to the price charged. Furnitures are old and the blanket was not comfortable.,0
The staff and service is wonderful. The ubication is the best| but the hotel needs some improvements. the bathroom in our room had mold in the shower and the pillows were a little flat. Nevertheless| our stay was pleasant and nice.,1
The area around the property was filthy. The hotel was subpar| booked for 2 nights stay| left after one night.,0
It's tough as a lot of hotels have closed.,1
It was great!! Excellent location. Friendly service. No refrigerator though.,1
The parking was too far,1
The toilet was broken | the room was dirty|  theres no luggage service a d there's no room service .,0
It was dirty| there's leftover food inside the fridge and there's a sleeping dress in the bathroom. There's blood in the shower curtain. Hair fall in the bathtub. And I booked a superior room with the times square view but we didn't get the room.,0
Nice room,1
Unprofessional front desk service. Poor amenities,0
The staff at the Millennium was extremely accommodating and courteous. So much so that whatever the hotel may have lacked because| of the age of the property| I would happily stay there again. There is something to say for hotel staff that goes out of their way to make our you stay pleasant.,1
Good location if you want to be in within walking distance of Time Square and several other key site. You will need to plan for parking as street parking will be a challenge. The rooms are good and comfortable with limited amenities. Our only issue was getting early check-in and adjoining rooms.,1
The maintenance was excellent but they don't have any parking I ended up paid a lot of more money than I was planning to I don't think that I come back there,0
The property is disgusting. Rooms are so gross. Bathroom and numerous things broken. Mold in bathroom,0
It was okay | is expected better.,0
Staff was rude elevators weren't working properly. Their system was down all the time. Asked for help to get a room for early check in or pay extra they didn't bother to even check or help accommodate they just gave a quick and straight NO!.Before flying in I called to ask for these accommodations and the night operator was so rude asked me 3 times if I was sure I wanted to be transferred to front desk that they were so busy and most likely i was going to be on hold for a long time or they were not going to answer my call I said that's fine I'll wait and she was mad about that too.,0
"Staff had many problems| and were not willing to assist guests to solve these problems. The card to my room did not work and I was told to ""deal with it."" Wifi also went out multiple times in my 5 day stay| and as an international working traveler this was a big burden on me.",0
Great location | good view | BIG bed . It was two adults 1 child and an infant and we all were able to sleep comfortably . We only stayed one night but the staff was friendly . Parking was right by us . Staff was always available to answer question and housekeeping was fast .,1
Very inconvenient hotel| no parking available| you have to pay for parking and its 2 blocks away| no in and out's you have to pay each time you park| Our room wasn't cleaned at all| our room keys didn't work for 3 nights straight because they were in the middle of a system update| they had to go service us by opening the room and then would go back down to get the keys reprogrammed. Long lines for check in| only a couple of staff members working for check in. The first night the streets were closed and couldn't access the hotel at all for 2 hours and when we called the hotel they brushed us off saying we need to ask the police for directions to get to the hotel. I was unsatisfied given the location I expected better quality and customer service.,0
It just change from Double Tree to Millenium| it shows the lack of maintenance| the room was smelly and the staff didn't give us a diferent one,0
The AC didn't turn on so I called the reception and was told they still had the heat on and to crack my window as a solution. With 85F weather!,0
Rooms smelled very bad| carpet and walls dirty| bathroom walls paint peeling| not worthy for that type of room,0
It is a very beautiful hotel,1
Enjoyed a good value! $79 dollars a night with a corner room to look outside on two sides with one facing the Paramount building! AC works well but needed to continually run it or the scent of cigarettes lingers. Great value and average facility.,1
This property was terrible. It's listed on Expedia as doubletree by Hilton Millennium Times Square. When you Google that name a hotel on 40th street comes up with great reviews. So I booked the room. The day of arrival I went to check in only to find that it's the wrong property. The property I booked is on 44th street. I was bewildered because I googled it yet again and it came up as the property I was standing in (in which the front desk is telling me I don't have a reservation). Turns out to find the property I booked I needed to type in only ‚ÄúMillenium Times Square‚Äù. Yep that's right completely leaving off the Hilton name. Upon check in I figured out why. The lobby was ok. The front desk clerk was clueless about hilton honors etc. He checked me into a room and gave me an empty key holder. I said to him I think you forget the key. He responded ‚Äúno our key card machine is down right now anytime you need to go up please see security‚Äù. I thought ok no big deal I'll have dinner and come back it will be fixed. Nope! It was like this the entire weekend. I had to see security to escort back to my room every time I needed to go up. I finally get to the long awaited room. It's a disaster! There is not one towel in the bathroom|  not even a face towel. There is no shower curtain on the tub and the room stinks of old cigarettes. To make matters worse the paint is peeling in the bathroom badly. The entire room needs to be renovated. New room change is same way. 6 HOURS to get towels!!,0
Nice hotel| clean.,1
The location was great.,1
I didn't appreciate the false advertisement of amenities. Also service was poor and tub did not work. Also furniture was old except the bed. If it wasn't for the view it would have been an absolute no. For all the money this hotel is collecting it should have a better presentation. Especially to be in the heart of the city.,0
I won't be back! Terrible!,0
Need to improve on service. Otherwise the hotel itself was nice.,1
The hotel changed the name| was nowhere mentioned| taxi driver could not find it. Some unfriendly staff members| where not helpful at all. There where some extra charges which nowhere got mentioned..,0
The staff was very kind and the lobby is beautiful. The walls in the room had what appeared to be blood on them and the AC unit was not the typical cold air blasting one| so it was pretty hot in the room. Overall the room was okay besides that.,1
Not what I expect for it to be in time square....the only thing open in that hotel is the rooms.... everything else is closed| however the price stay the same...,0
I DIDNT EVEN STAY AT THIS HOTEL AND STILL GOT CHARGED BY EXPEDIA,0
Loved it!,1
My room was so dirty but not only that .... The room was so very damaged and very stinking to cigarette and marijuana.  For any reason my room was ugly,0
Very disappointing. Not even a coffee maker offered in a suite room. Will not plan to visit again. Access cards to the room was not offered due to some system problem. Overall worst.,0
I didnt Like anything about my stay,0
I booked a 2 night stay at this hotel and I was completely disappointed!!First| upon checking in and going to our room the key card did not work. No problem| i know it happens. I go down to the front desk to find a line of people with the same issue. We are then told they key card system is down and to go tonthe room and wait to be let in by security. No time frame was given| only that they woule be there as soon as possible. Again| things happen| I get it. I leave and return later that evening and the cards still do not work but a temporary card is issued but we are asked to return them the next day. Next day| the cards did not work again. I'm annoyed| but again things happen.The next issue I encountered was a clogged bathroom sink. After washing our hands the water never drained. Upon reporting it| maintenance came and drained the sink| using our waste baskets| leaving the floor soaked. He left and came back throwing towels on the floor and saying the sink was empty but he needed to come back with a snake - leaving the wet towels and a bent hanger in the sink. Again| I left for the afternoon and returned later that evening to the exact same mess he left - never returning to fix the sink. We ended up having to wash our hands and brush our teeth over the bathtub. Aside from those incredible inconveniences... the blankets look rather warn and over used and there are no amenities (which could be due to COVID.Overall I was very dissatisfied with my stay here!!,0
The only good thing about this property is the location. I can't believe Hilton puts it's name on this dump.,0
Excellent location. Excellent price. Parking is close to the hotel and it is also a great price.,1
The room had a weird smell from the minute I walked in. Also the carpet was very dirty and to top it off their system went down and security had to come up with me to open my door. I was very disappointed because I heard great things about this hotel.,0
The hotel staff was very accommodating! The only downfall was that due to what I would assume is COVID restrictions we didn't have what I would think would be in the room otherwise. We had no cups.. we had no coffee in the room... and strangely no washcloths,1
Well the hotel is in a good location| walking distance from Times Square. The room was terrible there was red stains on the carpet| cigarettes burns on the carpet| a smell of cigarettes| wallpaper was coming off| there was a crack on the bathroom ceiling| and there was something spilled on the outside of window witch was obstructing the view the main attraction. I will say the staff was nice but there key system also did go down while at our stay witch was inconvenient. What I got from my stay is that you give up one ether a nice room and no view or get a view with bad room. Would I stay at this hotel probably not.,0
The pictures were very misleading in the website and overall not what i expected.,0
Hotel is run down..,0
Everything was fine,1
I'm not one to complain but this hotel is DISGUSTING. We booked this hotel for my birthday trip to arrive to a ‚Äústandard‚Äù room for one night since we extended our trip and we're staying in a ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù room for the rest of the stay. Our standard room smelled stale| the chair for the desk was stained and looked unclean. The lights in the hallway by the door didn't work and neither did the lamps on the desk and nightstand| we had no shower curtain and there was vomit running down the outside of the windows. There was an ice bucket| but no bags or cups. The tv did not work and the carpet was badly stained. We complained and the front desk said that they would send a maintenance guy to fix those things| but did not offer anything. We decided not to complain since we were changing rooms the next day and we had booked a more expensive| ‚Äúbetter‚Äù room. Well the room wasn't better. It also smelled stale| the lamp on my side of the bed didn't work. The plug in the bathroom looked like it was about to electrocute you and didn't work until I reset it 3 times| there was no mini fridge| and there was hair ALL OVER THE PLACE. Black hair on the bathroom floors| on the bed over| on our ‚Äúnew‚Äù towels in the bathroom. Disgusting. This was such a disappointment and we truly expected more especially since carrying the ‚ÄúHilton‚Äù name. I will never stay at a Hilton again. I have no idea why this has 4 stars. Absolutely ridiculous.,0
Shower hook is broken and mess on the bed when I checked in the room.  It was really bad condition although the location is so nice.,0
Overal food just minimal details like the room key constantly getting deactivated,1
I have to say my stay was as i exspected . I just wish it had a coffee maker n a micowave| all in all i had a great time n the rm was beautful,1
I do not know what type of service you offered| but there is no refrigerator in the room| and cold. When I checked in| the front emphasized that there will be no cleaning service unless I pay more for the cleaning. Unbelievable. What have you done? Plus| I was supposed to pay $100 at the property| but they insisted to pay $125. Please sort this out. Thanks!,0
No refrigerator or mini bar as listed on the website. No coffee pot or packs. Restaurant was closed and was told it was open until midnight. So late night walk for dinner. No blankets| just sheets in a cold room. Overpriced for the lack of amenities,0
The room was really nice and clean staff was very polite and I will rent a room from them again I enjoyed myself,1
I pay for superior hi flor at don't have that at cleaning room terrific very bad experience specially went they charged for the spa fee at don't work the only good it's the location,0
The best was Zahir| the recepcionist. Very helpful and nice.,1
The hotel looks nice at check in and down stairs but that was the only nice thing about the hotel. Our room was not clean in the slightest| we found trash| dust and stains. The hotel staff was not friendly or attentive. They do not hold luggage| they suggest you go down the street and pay for luggage holding. Our view was nice but not what the photos show. After check out I got an unexpected charge of $86. I called the hotel to ask why| they transferred me to ‚Äúan accountant‚Äù who lead me to an answering machine and hung up the phone. Overall probably the worst hotel I've ever stayed at. I'm so disappointed :(,0
the room had mold and wasn't clean| no coffee in the room,0
I really enjoyed my stay.,1
Like: proximity to the best NYC theater scenes and Times Square crowd.Don't Like: the hotel needs an update or upgrade. My room had missing faucet pieces| the tiles and tub are dirty| the carpet has obvious stains| the sheer curtains have tears| the furniture are old with scratches:  needless to say‚Äîa disappointment for the price I stayed (5nights).,1
Property resembled nothing of a Doubletree property! It was old| outdated| smelled of cigarettes|  dirty dirty dirty! Toilets not working|  lights out| chipped furniture|  stained carpet| ice machines broken.,0
They canceled my reservation,0
Good property,1
Perfect location right in the middle of the action at time's square,1
When we checked in | instant disappointment is all I can describe. The room was filthy. There was a pasty white residue on top of the dresser the tv was on. The bathroom floor looked like it hadn't been mopped during the past few stays. The smoke detector was covered in plastic wrap. The mirror was cracked on the closet. The furniture had water stains and looked warped. The drawers on the dresser were about to fall off. There was missing pictures off the wall. The room was horrendous. I had a manager come to the room to see for themselves| and to see how they would fix the problem. They were kind enough to offer me one of their best rooms to fix the situation| when in reality they gave me another standard room on a higher floor the next night. Nothing special about the room other than it was clean enough to stay in. Highly disappointed. The pictures posted don't reflect the rooms in current condition. Staff was for the most part friendly.  Good location if you plan on visiting Times Square| as it's a very close walk. Just remember you get what you pay for on these package deals.,0
The hotel staff was nice. But we were shocked to go into our room that was ‚Äúcleaned‚Äù but we are pretty sure was used for an hour our two and then given to us. The wall paper was falling off| the towels had brown stains and smelled| there was literally a HOLE filled with GARBAGE behind my sisters bed. Our little cleanliness welcome package was found opened in our room. I will never stay here again and will be active about letting my friends know not to. It was so bad my sister and I left at 5:00 am to get on the first train out that we could find. I'm staying at a much nicer hotel on my return to NYC Monday. Seriously don't stay here unless you are looking for a place for a one night stand.,0
Hotel is old| in need of updates and repairs.  Staff is rude and not helpful. This is NOT a 4 star hotel!,0
When first going in the room it was stuffy. The tub had mold all around it and the tub was stopped up. When you cut the shower on the water was spraying everywhere. I paid $200 for 1 night and the room didn't even have a fridge or microwave in it. It was the worse experience and I wouldn't recommend anyone staying here. The only good thing about it is the location and the access to a lot of things in the area. I would never stay here again if I come back to New York,0
I loved that it was steps from Times Square,1
Stayed in a suite| didn't feel luxurious. Furnitures are old| especially the sofa I couldn't believe they still keep it. Elevators are kinda scary seem like they can be broken anytime Not worth it.,0
Enjoyed my stay but some issues I did experience was toilet wouldn't flush. The sheets were def old.,1
The stopper in our tub was stuck/broken everything else was great,1
Very center located .. like the way they don't allow anyone to enter elevators after 8pm without room keys and al the Covid safety regulations,1
I liked everything.,1
This hotel is as clean and nice as a local Motel 6,0
Very friendly staff. They Found out it it was my husband's birthday and they up graded out our free of charge,1
Area is not appropriate for a family vacation illicit activities is all over the surrounding area such drugs and prostitution,0
I was a little disappoint| that the room has not a minibar/refrigerator| nor a microwave since the hotel restaurant and lounge were closed| no room service neither. I understand that during this pandemical time| there are rules and regulations still to follow. I hope next time| things will be better.,1
This was a great experience. Clean room and a great view to the ball drop.,1
One of the worst Hilton chain of hotels I have ever staid| also the staff was rude and unhelpful they charged me for the room with view but the room was broken so transferred me to one of the lowest floors without even compensating for the higher cost which they charged before and on top of that staff was rude| will never recommend this hotel to anyone.,0
"I could write a book on how bad my stay was and I only was there for about 20 hours.  First off they don't have baggage storage due to Covid| so be prepared to take your things with you or find an alternative luggage storage option.  After I checked in I left my bags in the room to go eat and returned to them being gone.  The hotel had made a mistake and the bellmen moved them to a different room on accident.  (so no storage but they can move bags? seems odd right)  It took them over an hour to get my bags back to me because the bell man was ""on break| sorry""  The bathroom is outdated| the windows were dirty and their were stains in my carpet.  I also paid $50 for a late check out and while sitting and relaxing I had maids try to come in three times even though I had told them I had a late checkout.  Worst Hilton property I ever stayed at.",0
Pretty disappointed. For it to be a Hilton it was not at all what you would expect. The rooms smell like smoke and It didn't say it was allowed.,0
My room not ready for check-in have to pay $15 extra per day for another room. That what nothing what i see on pictures. Also people smoke inside the rooms. Not towels first day. And first day the person do my check-in send me to a room that was occupied and i have to go down the lobby again to get the room number right. Absolutely not reserved again in this places.,0
The Millennium is a great place to stay. The staff was always friendly| polite| and courteous. The only drawback was the in house restaurant was closed| along with many other restaurants in the area. Overall| the stay was very nice.,1
Good place to stay,1
Like that it was in The middle of time square,0
The view was amazing,1
Superb location| wonderfully quiet nights| courteous and unobtrusive housekeeping staff| simple check-in and check-out.,1
traveled all the way from CT with my wife and children.... 1st room was on 44th floor| but so dirty stains everywhere and run down| bathroom moldy| sent me and family to a second room on 38th floor which was not even cleaned yet.   Still had dirty towels on floor and trash etc.  we waited for 45 minutes while they verified room condition as if i would be lying.   Then manager named Kristen walked me personally to another room which was newly renovated and i just accepted because at least it was new and clean for my children during COVID.  She promised she would send the key up with someone and in the mean time my family and i moved with all of our bags again down to the 31 floor and waited for 25 minutes.  After no one showing up i went down again to the front desk and they gave me a set of keys.  I returned to the room indicated to me and shown to me personally by the manager and the door would not open.  when i looked at the keys they had given me keys to a completey different room with no mention of the change.  I went back down and they informed me that this room was same as other but that they had just booked the other room that they promised me and instead put me in a unrenovated room with mold all over the bathroom| pee stains on the floor| stains all over ceiling| ceiling in bathroom falling down. paint missig everywhere| smellling old because of the unclean carpet| carpet had white stains everywhere.  This place was just utterly disgusting.  will call city health dep,0
This place looks nice on the outside but rooms are not great at all not clean and OVERPRICED!,0
This hotel was listed as a 4 star hotel. When we checked in| the standard towels weren't there. It took 45 mins and 3 calls to get someone to bring us towels. When I warmed up my shower| yellow liquid started dripping from the bathroom ceiling which we ended up wiping off. The room and elevators smelled like cigarettes even though it's a non smoking hotel. Check in guy was rude when I asked him what floor I would be on. Overall| it was just a place I used to sleep while visiting the city| I will not be back.,0
Prime location| only steps from Times Square. I paid extra to have a room with city view and it was not worth it| you can't see much. Overall the room was clean but old. Parking is right across the hotel but it's around $25 per night. The hotel doesn't have luggage storage service| so if you get there before check in time you will need to look for a place to storage your luggage| same for check out. I found a storage place two blocks from the hotel and they do it for $10 per bag.,1
This location is in terrible shape. Rooms have dirty corners| stuff stuck on the carpet| paint peeling on the bathroom ceiling| the hardest most uncomfortable beds| thread born comforters(they look to be 3-4 years old at minimum)| no fridge in the room| closet door were missing but the hardware is still there| all the furniture is chipped and stained...just horrible condition. I travel for a living and have premium status with Hilton so I was shocked at the condition. Even the elevators were filthy and the same trash that was there when I checked in was still there two days later. Does anyone clean this place?  The location is FANTASTIC but know what you're getting when you make your reservation. It's awful. Such a huge disappointment!!  I will never go back and will not recommend this property to anyone.,0
The attention was great....,1
This hotel charged me twice leaving me $-200 in my bank account and is now fighting with me in order to give it back to me!,0
They gave my room away so I did not get what I paid for there were seveal things broken in the room and old fries in the bed sheets. I would never stay there again not even if it was free.,0
Had few issues in the begging of due to a misunderstanding but all worked out the manager was so friendly,1
The rooms smelled and were dirty| bath tub had mold. Wouldn't recommend this place especially if you're traveling with children.,0
Did not get the room i originally payed extra money for.,0
Very nice room| very clean. You can hear the elevators| so if you're sensitive to noise| could be a bother. Corner room overlooking Times Square-excellent.,1
The building is in need of serious update| its old and feel filty. It took 1 hour to check-in and another 45 minutes to get into the elevator. There is limited elevators for the reason of covid-19 but since people complained they cramped people in which defeats the point of the safeguard of people. I will never stay here again.,0
There were blood on the sheets and i didn't get the room that i had paid for i would like a refund,0
Everything was great.,1
The room where dirty. Chair was broke. Mattress is old. Stains on the floor,0
location,1
I always go to this hotel when in the city. The rooms are spacious and clean. Check-ins are quick and staff is always friendly!!!!,1
"***READ BEFORE YOU BOOK***I am so disappointed| as a native New Yorker I expected more from this hotel| especially from what I paid! On the website the rooms look beautiful. Don't be fooled! The room smelled like cigarettes| sweat and despair. There was stains everywhere. I only gave it two stars because after I complained they changed my room to a semi decent one| with a nice view. I booked a deluxe king for two nights. Never again! If you are desperate| don't care about cleanliness| and just need a quick place to sleep then stay here. Otherwise run! On top of that they charged me ""Resort fees""| based on the cleanliness issue| I wouldn't use the gym even if it came with a free night.",0
No Blankets in room | No room service|minimum facilities also not provided,0
"I'm very disappointed in Expedia for allowing me to book this hotel under the Hilton name. I usually exclusively stay at Hilton hotels and even though there were hotels at a lpwer price i made this selection because i was under the impression it was ""Hilton"". Upon arrival i realized quickly there was nothing Hilton about this very old poorly kept property. I was so confused upon arrival Inasked the receptionist if i was at the Double Tree by Hilton and he looked so confused telling me we are under several different names. Be advised this hotel is NOTHING Hilton. Moving forward I will no longer book with expedia as this is the aecond thime this has happened to me and I even used my expedia points towards this hotel thinking it was gonna be a good choice. VERY DISAPPOINTED IN Expedia.",0
Pros: large room for a New York City hotel; location in proximity to Times Square is prime location Cons: the bathroom was absolutely disgusting. Luckily I always travel with Clorox wipes because I had to clean the bathroom to be even remotely usable. The sink was dirty and had hair in it| the toilet had pee stains on it and the bathtub had hair and mold all over. Overall| I probably wouldn't stay here again. I just can't get over how gross the bathroom was.,0
Location and view was great but the room was dirty when I walked into the room to my right it was cobwebs all on the wall soon as you walk in. The bathroom wasn't the cleanest no refrigerator or microwave in room nor did we have blankets on our bed. Ok room but I will not be staying there again.,0
Everything was great!!!,1
Terrible| first hotel that doesn't have microwave neither a mini fridge to put drinks or food.,0
Paid for parking thinking it was for the garage across the street but it was pretty far down the road.  Hotel was nice.  A little dated but the view was great!,1
It was nice.,1
I loved the view! The staff were nice and very welcoming.,1
No fridge| no microwave. Only 2 beds and wouldn't give us a cot for child to use one night.,1
I don't like nothing very disappointing. I don't stay again,0
The property misrepresented itself with the photos online. We had two rooms and neither matched the photos. We had to clean our bathroom due to the tub not looking as clean. The smell of marijuana was overwhelming throughout the hotel but especially in my daughters room almost to the point where they could not sleep there in a hotel that claims to be smoke-free. This is a policy that is clearly not enforced. I would not stay at this hotel again.,0
I think you would be able to find better accommodations at a motel 6 this place was absolutely horrible. I'm not sure why Hilton would even be associated with this dilapidated  hotel.,0
My room smelled like cigarettes and bathroom was dirty,0
I am very disappointed in my stay the room was waste more than I expected for what I paid. I picked the wrong choice because I was supposed to have free parking end end up paying extra 150 for parking because the parking lot that they used was full every time I tried to park. And the person that I checked in with was very rude.,0
It is ok price wise but it is not quite clean inside the room .,1
Mold in room and toilet didn't flush and no shower curtain| worst double tree I've ever stayed at!,0
It was coo,1
It was great| just know there's no mini fridge which was more of a inconvenient than I thought it would be. And I had to wait a couple hours for housekeeping to bring towels the first night. But overall great| fast checkin| friendly staff| would book again,1
Rude| dirty hotel and had to pay $25 a night. Not worth it. Worst experience,0
Not satisfied with view or atmosphere smelled like smoke a through the building,0
Hotel is horrible. Everything was falling apart: wall paper| bathtub drain| lamp shade. Bed comforter or the piece of paper that it felt like was dirty. Room had no wash rags I had to wait 4 hrs just to wash my face after a road trip to NY. Bathtub is dirty. This is by far is listed WORSE HOTEL IVE EVER BEEN TO. The bottom of the food chain in regards to hotels. I didn't even stay the night. DO NOT HO HERE,0
"Sheets were stained with blood. Was never provided with a rollaway bed| housekeeping said they ""forgot"" to bring it up then they ran out after I called for the third time. Took 45 minutes to bring extra towels when I asked. Not happy pay more and stay somewhere else.",0
Location is amazing!!!!! The rooms have a good aize to be in NY.,1
I liked that it was rite off the time square| but the room was dirty lamps didn't turn on tv didn't had signal| it was supposed to be ball drop view which I paid extra and it wasn't,0
I've stayed here for a few years| on and off. Staff is fine| hotel itself is fine| but I can honestly say the people checking into thd hotel are much different than the ones prior to this past year. Different crowd| loud at night| doors slamming at 1:30am= no more staying here like before.,1
The room was filthy full of dust.  Very unsanitary I contacted the manager several times to get the room clean. Bedding had dirt and sand. Area is dirty. First time in New York it was my birthday and was very dissatisfied and disappointed.,0
I liked the view| the fact that check in was fast .... i didnt like the fact that there were no fridge in the room| not sure if you have to request one or not.,1
i really didnt like it| i feel like parking should be free and the room was ok.,1
I really resent that the $50 ‚Äúresort fee‚Äù isn't included with the hotel price- go ahead and factor that in with this hotel. Apparently it's done to avoid city taxes.... so shady. Our room had a stained carpet| threadbare bedspreads and- worst of all- no shower curtain! Don't assume that because this is a Hilton that you will get standardized quality. You can do better in Times Square.,0
The front desk was not responsive to calls I made throughout my stay. I waited long lengths of time for a representative to answer my calls| and when someone finally answered on rare occasions| the representative would connect me to a line| in which no one picked up. My room did not include common amenities of a hotel room| such as an ice container| coffee maker| and blankets for the beds (I slept with just a sheet for the first night).,0
This hotel is very disappointing. It's a 4 star with Expedia but I don't think it's even a 3 star. It's wall are disgusting| wall paper peeling off and stains all over| pillows extremely flat and yellow| there is mold all over the bathroom ceiling and tub. How can this even be sanitary?? Refrigerator has been removed from the room and phones don't work.,0
I very much appreciated the staff and registration.  We arrived after driving for six hours and felt the registration was smooth| informative| and patient with all my questions.  The front desk staffer's name was Tiffany who was a joy to interact with.,1
The hotel is very nice | however there were some stuff in the room that didn't worked.,0
The property is beautiful| it's classic New York.The wallpaper in the room was falling off| there was a water leak in the ceiling at some point because the ceiling was torn and hanging. I tried calling 15 times before I arrived to confirm my room with 0 answers. I was given a room without a view even though I paid extra for the deluxe room| kind of the whole point of booking a hotel in Time Square. When I called from the hotel phone in the room I was put on hold 4 times with no answer.,0
My stay wasn't bad at all but when I checked in the guy behind the counter said oh I up graded you and then asked for my card. I know a lot of hotels ask for a deposit which is fine BUT you shouldn't say you get free parking when in fact the $25 dollar deposit was for parking!,1
False pictures of,0
The room did not look like in the picture. My room was supposed to have a view of time square it did not. The beds were very tiny and uncomfortable. While there they did not clean our room. The parking was free but you had to walk about 5 minutes to get there.,0
I enjoy the fact that parking was cross the street. There was alot to do around the hotel. My room was up graded so we could have a better view of the ball drop.,1
What I liked about the property it was clean and cozy. What I did not like was the staff taking longer to give me the keys for the room I booked. My reservation was at 4pm and I didn't get it till 4:45. I had to go up to the front desk and ask them again.,1
Staying in this building | wasn't as I expected. They don't really care about people staying in,0
Perfect location..friendly staff...hard beds..rooms could use some updates but your paying for location!..so it worked for us!,1
Only issues is that i was not recognized as a Hilton honors member| or as minimal 2 waters. Also no cups in the room. I was in the Doubletree last week in Stamford| Connecticut and they were very accommodating.,1
Nice place| had fresh warm cookies waiting for us :),1
It was clean and nice the staff was really helpful,1
No refrigerator and out of 52 floors no microwave  I had to go to the front desk to get them to send towels and linens,1
This hotel is borderline. It isn't very clean| only partially updated| and the staff is skimpy. I wasn't ever able to get anyone to answer the phone either by calling in-house or calling the number directly. There were extremely long waits at the elevators| and no security. The entire hotel smelled like marijuana and there were a lot of people hanging around the lobby| elevators| and outside. I do not recommend this hotel. Also be careful if you do reserve. There is a daily fee that will be added after your trip.,0
Won't stay again staff and customer service not friendly,0
The cleanliness of the hotel could have been a lot better. The hotel  needs some work and upgrades. The bathroom needs a lot of work and cleaning. The reservation host Robert foe millennium was very rude. He made the decision to be in this industry and he was the least bit hospitable.,0
The hotel was Convenient to Times Square. It was affordable but not cheap.,0
This was by far the worst hotel I have ever at. Terrible service. The whole hotel smelled like weed including in my room. Staff was rude and didn't even make an attempt to help. Found a large piece of glass on the floor in my room. A/C barely worked. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL,0
Location is great| service is good. Expected more about the room. Requested for the sheets to be exchange for a better/ never ones| which they were happy to do so. The room smelled good| it just need a better remodeling.,1
Great room in an amazing location. Everything was pretty standard and comfortable for our weekend getaway.,1
Upon arrival we were greeted by 7-10 people by the front door smoking weed. The line to check in was long and slow. The first room we were assigned reeked of weed and was possibly occupied or just not cleaned. The smoke detector was taped off and there was trash all over. The next room was more of a kit than a finished product. Most of the parts were there but you put it together yourself. We had to request several missing items. ie. comforters and pillows. The lobby was an adventure. And to top things off the parting shot was they don't hold luggage if you have more bags than they want to deal with.,0
Extremely unorganized place and people. They kept sending me to a room that was already locked from inside and when security opened it someone was staying there. Low security,0
Given the state of the word today this was highly clean and  ERY comfortable,1
The hotel was nice for the price. We got a King room with a view of Times Square.,1
The property was nice but the room was decent| the bathroom looked OK but the shower was starting to mold and the drain in the tub was broken. Some of the lights in the room didn't work and there was no microwave or fridge in the room.,0
They offer free Parking but you have to leave your car there. I was there for a week and couldn't take my car out intil check out or it was going to be a $70 fee,0
The hotel had a great location.  The room was clean & we had a great view of Times Square. During the weekend the line for the elevators created heavy traffic. What was our biggest hassle was the door latch which locked our door from the inside. This happened twice before we had to tape it down in order to not be locked out of our room. Lastly calling the front desk from any phone is pointless|  they won't answer.  The only way to talk to hotel staff is by standing in front of them. Upon check out the staff at the front desk just brushed off my complaints.,0
This is the worst hotel I've stayed at|| do not book|  phone wasn't connected|| not clean|| had to wait over an hour for clean towels,0
i didn't like that the person across the street from the parking garage told us this was parking for the hotel but it wasn't so we had to pay $100,1
I loved my time square view. The location was in the middle of everything,1
First I must say that all the pictures of the rooms are wayyy off. My room and my family members room looked like we stayed at the Super 8 motel| and I would never stay there. All together we had three rooms| none of the rooms were cleaned well. The bathroom tub & sink didnt even look like they were disenfected. I had to lay a towel in the tub when I bathed because it just did not look sanitary. I requested if they could change my room and was told no| but the individuals on the line before and after me were able to move their rooms. I felt discriminated against and disregarded. I've stayed at properties that had less rating but beautiful room accomodations. Finally| we felt as if the mattresses were made out of wood. Not one peaceful night of rest| so disappointed in such a high profile property.Never Again.. for business or pleasure.,0
New York Times Square so much to do and see! So much different tastes of food! Always somebody out there willing to help you,1
I felt like the whole place was dated| there was no coffee in the room to have in the morning| no cups either I had to ask room service for cups. The bathroom water was green| I made a bath and the water was green! The plug didn't work I had to pull the plug with my hand. In the morning I waited 15 minutes for the elevator just to get downstairs to check out! When I went to check out there was a huge queue.,0
Everything was great| only downside was no mini fridge and the blankets were very thin and the bed was uncomfortable.,1
Very nice hotel | the first room I got was kinda not so good like the photos and the view sucked but when I went to the front desk they were so nice they changed my room and got an even better one !,1
Best location and very clean ... easy check in. Overall nice hotel,1
Was incredibly disappointed with my two night stay at this hotel. My room did not have ac. Apparently during the winter the hotel switches to heater only and the occupants are not able to change to ac is the room is too hot. I was told to open the windows if the room was too hot! My room did not have a refrigerator either. Lastly| the occupants from the room adjacent to mine were smoking marijuana. I called to complain three times and nothing was done to stop these individuals from doing as they pleased. Needless to say I will NOT be staying here ever again!,0
The location is great| some staff is nice and some are just plain rude. The room is dirty with molding on the shower. To top it off| we were missing a thermostat and the room was hot. We called multiple times| we finally got someone to bring us a thermostat cover and he even asked us ‚Äúwhat do you want this for?if it's too hot the building is kept as 65 no exceptions ‚Äù. Only to find that the thermostat had no batteries. Horrible| we called and called and they were rude and ignoring our calls. Thankfully we were only there for the weekend. Never will I use them again.,0
The property needs a lot of work. The elevators and rooms were are showing that updates are mandatory.,0
The property was ok.  Was expecting a bit more for it being in time square.,1
I would say the location is a 5 star but the hotel is disgusting | the beds are hard as rock the rugs are stained and dirty| the bathroom has mold in it and the ceiling was peeling off. they didn't offer a blanket. don't bring children with you with here it's basically a party hotel,0
It was very close to Times Square. The view was very nice and I enjoyed it.,1
Area was perfect | customer service was ok and the room was ok | but the Elevator was terrible waiting almost 30 minutes to get down to the lobby was two Elevators in service out of 6 .,1
Every thing was clean and check in was a breeze.Yoh should note that while this may be owned by Double Tree| it is not a Double Tree hotel.   It is not on the sign and staff will even say it is not a Doubletree  (no cookies either).Only complaint is the maid who was weirdly aggressive (banging on dpor 830 am and while we were leaving yelled at us for our door being open).  But I think that was not the norm and really didn't take away from hpw great everything else was.,1
The staff were nice but the rooms were dirty and in need of a lot of repairs and updating. Hotel rooms didn't look anything like it did in the photos,0
The only good thing about the hotel is its location super close to Times Square. Hotel needs some remodeling. At check out time you need to wait at least 45-60 mins (never seen something like that before) to get in the elevator from how much I had to wait the only solution I had at that point is to take the stairs from the 36th floor down to the lobby! Not just that .. when you check in the staff act all nice and tell you sir we will waive the resort fee don't worry about it we're only going to charge you the deposit $50 per night. Then you find out the charge you $28.69 per night for the resort fee when you call to ask they all deny that sentence they say to everyone it happened to me and 5 of my friends. It was a horrible experience,0
Right next to time square and a beautiful building super cool !,1
My stay was not what I expected the Continental breakfast was not there fost advertisement in addition to the room that was on the site was not the same as the one I had everything just didn't add up but the flight was amazing,0
I was very dissapointed with the service here. I checked in and it they gave me a room that was booked already. Also they had me wait for 2 hours after they intially gave me the wrong room to get a new one. Worst service ever.,0
This hotel is not what appears to be in the pictures the lobby is nice but the rooms are horrible our heater was broke it was freezing and the thermostat was not working called front desk and got no answer the mattress feels like brick,0
Horrible hotel!The only good thing about this place is the locations! For the entire 3 days that I spend there no cleaning service| rude Staff| crappy beds and pillows....etc!Even the check out was like they were doing me a favor!,0
Good place good people good hotel good time for family,1
Stay was good overall only issue was the bathroom shower head was damaged,1
Service was horrible. I paid extra for a specific room with a view. I ended up getting placed in a standard room with no view and bathroom was full of hair| tv not working| phone not working to call from desk| whole floor smelled like marijuana| bed sheets had red stains that looked like blood stains| the mini fridge in the room had left over food from a previous person in that room,0
The only good thing about this hotel is the location.,0
The worse experience at the Millenium Hilton Hotel Time square !!! Not clean | very dirty| worse mattress and pillow . Horrible Hotel !!! Very bad smell,0
The location is convenient & the bed was comfortable| other than that it's a 2/10. I won't be back. It was not clean at all| the bathroom was out dated| the shower had bad water pressure| leftover hair from the previous guest in the shower| a rusty drain. The bedroom windows were filthy and the remote to the tv had sauce or dried food on it. I reserved a queen room and during check in was informed they no longer have a Queen room available in even tho I reserved and paid in advance and they then gave me a room with a double bed.,0
The room that i purchased was nothing like what i received. Check-in took forever because only two people were working the desk and the line was out the door.  My room was decent for a King room w/ a view and that's if you even want to call it a view. Majority of the view was company buildings instead of times square. I expected a nice| relaxing tub to relax and mellow out but instead i got a dingy tub with two dirt rings around it. Overall| it wasn't worth the price and i wouldn't stay here again.,0
So I checked in for Valentine's Day with my fianc√© | then the Water in the entire HOTEL goes out for 3 hrs! No water at all. Almost every guest complained . I couldn't check out and book at another hotel bcus of the expensive rates in Times Square. Then the water was cold the next couple days . No Hot water and they blamed it on Con Edison,0
The location of this hotel is very close to Times Square! However because of this| check in/check out is a very busy time and the staff isn't the nicest nor the most patient. Not to mention| the 6 elevators that the hotel offers are extremely slow and full to the max during these times. I will say the room was very clean| the staff kept things neat for us with fresh towels even when we didn't ask. Lastly| the view was pretty cool of Times Square and the room was quite spacious.,1
I was impressed by what we got for what we paid. I was a bit worried with all the negative reviews but you also have to consider that you are not paying a 5 star hotel. Great location and nice spacious rooms. Would stay again.,1
The bed was super uncomfortable!! Thin thin pillows| paper thin comforter| rock hard mattress. My boyfriend and I barely got any sleep. There is also no mini fridge or microwave.,0
Everything was extremely horrible. Dirty bathtub| broken stuff. No cups| no fridge| not even a remote for TV. Customer service horrible. I really want a refund. This felt like a shelter.,0
Terrible place rooms are small. No fridge in room| If you request a fridge it's an extra 30$ for a fridge!!!! Bettbkkkvkv,0
It's a really nice hotel for the price. If I go back to NYC I'll use the hotel again,1
I came into my room smelling a musky odor. No fridge in the room- had to request one - it did get delivered. Always had to be requesting things because housekeeping didn't come around. Only reason why I saw housekeeping was because I bumped into her in the hallway. At some point | I was missing soap towels and toilet paper,0
Excellent hotel and great staff with friendly service |It has a good location 2 min from the time square ..,1
I didn't like the service The staff workers got an attitude like they don't want to work there security too,0
There was no coffee maker or micro oven in room .,0
Convenient location in Times Square| however the bed was the most uncomfortable bed I have ever tried to sleep on . It was thin with hard lumps all over and the pillows were flat as a pancake.I understand with COVID-19 the staffing is poor |however upon check in I was informed if I wanted my room cleaned after my first night I would have to call and request it. The room was dusty| water stains on the dresser and the remote did not work .,0
Room Carpet needs to be cleaned| it carries an odor.Front desk never answers but front desk worker's are very polite & helpful.I felt very comfortable & safe during my stay. The tv shades darker the longer you watch it & the window view is amazing but should very much be cleaned. With covid restrictions going on I'll let certain things pass just hoping by march this hotel can actually show me a great time!üíú -Ja'neya Curves,1
I like the room and the view. Customer service was professional.,1
The bathtub was sticky. The shower was not working properly. It was stinking while we entered the room.,0
This place was very dirty. We had M&Ms on the floor and crumbs everywhere. The mattresses were very hard and the blanket was as thin as bedsheets,0
There was no type of food delivery services in the hotel. I also found the room very dirty was not clean. And there was no microwave or refrigerators in the room.,0
Old | didn't look like the picture on the site.  Staff was rude. Wouldn't recommend,0
Arrived to the hotel and greeted by a very welcoming front desk clerk.(I should've asked her name.)She made sure that everything went smoothly| including my request for robes and slippers. Despite the outdated room| at least it was clean| I had a pleasant experience.Thank you!,1
It was nice being right on 42nd street but the rooms do not look anything like the pictures| there was no minibar and the whole room was out of date. Besides that everything else was good but I wouldn't stay in this location again.,1
The place is great| close to many places| i would like add a microwave and a mini refrigerator on the rooms,1
Not what I expected. The bathtub Needed to be cleaned,0
Convenient | friendly| & close to many stores for your needs.,1
I was able to check in 3 hours early which is AMAZING. The staff was extremely friendly. The room was spacious and clean. I just wished I picked a room with a better view.,1
Not clean. Found someone else's used towel behind a chair and there were tissues not flushed in the toilet. Lamps also dusty.,0
Terrible Service when arrived at my hotel.Only one person working,0
I liked that it was right on Time Square action.,0
Location| was the best| the hotel is in timesquare heart,1
Great location! Need more staff for check in though had to wait a while.,1
Beautiful Lobby and polite staff. The furniture in the rooms are old/broken. Amenities short.,1
The location was amazing!!! Perfect hotel for our trip. Plan on booking again soon.,1
Good location but supper outdated and lack of service was disappointed.the sink was cracked and looked nothing like the photos,0
I didn't like our stayed in this hotel| we had three rooms and one of ours rooms had bugs on the bed. The only thing they did was change our room and also| had extra charges on my card of I'm not sure what. I've been trying to call the hotel but unfortunately they don't pick up. Overall| the hotel is in a good area.,0
I thought this was a prestigious hotel| unfortunately we found a cockroach in our room. The hotel only discounted 30 dollars and moved our room. I did not expect to go through this experience. Very unpleasant.,0
Quick and easy. Great location,1
Love everything | the time square room view | friendly employed | safety precautions during pandemic | will consider a next visit,1
Room was nothing like the pictures. Especially the bathroom.  It was old and carpet had a wet smell. Also wallpaper coming off all around. Should have stayed somewhere newer and up kept.,0
I forgot his name already but we had a nice conversation when he checked me in. I surprised my girlfriend by booking at a superior room ball drop view room| we loved it| it was our 2 years anniversary! I set up ballons and flower petals all around the room and she got emotional| the room was perfect nice and clean. Also I checked in 2 hours earlier then the regular check in time which was at 4| it was ready so the guy behind the desk asked him manager if there's any room available at the time since I got a ball drop view. He told he upgraded my room for no additional charge and I was excited| the room was bigger. My girl and I had a great stay| we had great time it was fun yk what i'm saying| will definitely recommend !,1
Outstanding hotel I will be going back.,1
Housekeeping staff courteous and friendly. Lobby personnel responsive to guest's needs.,1
For the price you pay per night is sad and dissatisfied in the cleanliness. The showers had mold and the tile was stained like a motel 6. The service is also sad..... all they said was sorry no form of a discount or accommodations for the dirty bathroom I had to stay in for 10 days. I will never stay here again,0
Great experience! Save money on parking,1
I love staying at this property. The staff is amazing. My rooms were very clean with view of the city. The only downside is some room no mini fridge and there aren't any microwaves which can be costly for extended stay visitors. There is a resort fee daily but due to COVID its not used. And still additional incidental fee. Overall I enjoy the stay but there is room for improvement.,1
Love being in Times Square. In the heart of the great NYC.,1
Location is very good and convenios and has a good view,1
Horrible service| roomsWere not cleaned. No room service,0
The only pros: LocationCons: Poor customer service| poor cleanliness| no room cleaning service at all (no even changing the towels)| hotel needs renovation| hotel charges.,0
I did not like Nothing at all. Parking is far and bathrooms dirty,0
I will never stay here again these people take your deposit money more than what they should be taking and never return it| thieves!!!!,0
This place is a DUMP. Rooms are gross/ not clean. The heater broke on my first & second night. Staff was RUDE that whole stay.,0
Great service!! Will be back. I would change the fact you can't control the AC in the rooms .With the Pandemic I love that they lysol the rooms for your safety .,1
Hotel was nasty Dirty . We checked out and cancelled our room for the weekend Noe month later hotel still has charged my credit card claiming we stayed there when we have proof we stayed at another hotel .. stay clear of this one,0
First of all the was no air conditioning in the room. I tried to call the manager and the front desk staff from the room phone multiple times| no answer. So I went to talk to a nice lady at the front desk| she said that there is only one pipe in the facility so it's either ac or heat and they had the heat on| mind you the highs this weekend were in the 70's. So she offered to have someone open our window and turn our heat off. Didn't work. I went to talk to the manager and asked her for a refund| manager was not polite or apologetic at all. Barely said two words to me and I was very polite with her. I ended up leaving and finding another hotel down the street. Overall the room was at best decent. Bed was hard as a rock and lumpy| seems like they need new mattresses. Overall| very disappointing stay. The only thing I enjoyed was the location and the view.,0
I love this hotel . I cant wait to come again the view is amazing and it's right near Times Square,1
From the moment  we checked in it was a disaster. The front desk staff made it almost impossible and not welcoming at all. Traveling during a pandemic is unnerving so it's normal for gue,0
Does not have microwaves :( which is very disappointing how am I going to warm my cold food,1
The overall qualitly of the room was bad | the rooms heating system was not working and my fiance is anemic so she got sick. Tried to switch hotels rooms but apparently none were available.,0
I was given 3 different rooms because all the rooms smelled like smoke and some was dirty. Every room was outdated and the city view was of the buildings next door blocking any city view and the windows was coted with a dirt film so the view was better at night.,0
This hotel had 0 amenities and when we booked the hotel we had no idea that there wasn't going to be any breakfast| lunch| or dinner. The hotel phones were broken| they were unresponsive every time we tried to get in contact with them and when we tried to check in| our reservation wasn't in their system. We had to wait 30 minutes just to be able to solve that issue. They are very slow and anytime you have to check in and check out be prepared to wait 30 minutes to do so. They are very slow.,0
Perfect location and very clean! The staff was also very helpful and everyone was so friendly!,1
The room was ok. The carpet is unclean. Made knocked on the door @ 8:00am while I was sleeping since she needed an early start to clean the room. Yelled at me for not answering her knock when I told her it was unacceptable to enter the room. I was asleep!,0
Nothing special about this property| I made some request while checking in that were not done.The staff didn't have any knowledge about the area restaurants and closing times| they were very rude since the dirt moment.No room service was provided to us| we called about 5 times to get new towels at least and front desk never replied.Also a housekeeper opened our door by mistake at 7am| then she said never mind you're not in my list.I personally work with hospitality and this is not what I was expecting.I understand the whole situation with the pandemic but we are paying for a service| at least a welcome or good morning would change your impression but not even that. If you have employees that treat guests like that| don't expect too many good reviews.,0
Everything was great and we appreciated being up on a high floor. The staff was very organized and swift. The room was very clean. The hotel was very clean.,1
Do not waste your money on this hotel it was dirty old nothing like the pictures they didn't have the room I reserved.. PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS HOTEL,0
No microwave in the whole place. The staff wasn't no help. Room had a odor.,0
With the pandemic going on these rooms are given away for low cost| with that said anybody goes to these hotels because of the price. I bet that if this wasn't going on you would see more upscale. The location is the best of things have changed so much in NYC because of the coronavirus. Be careful in time square. A lot of shady people asking for money and selling drugs. The hotel looks better in pictures then in real life. The room is good| for sleeping. Not much noise but that's because these rooms are not getting filled.,1
Place is run down ceilings are cracking only 1 outlet in our room tv remote was all sticky bathroom has mold in corners wouldn't stay again,0
For starters we had a little issue with our room. Staff and the manager took care of the problem very professionally.I will definitely stay at this establishment on my next trip.,1
We enjoyed the view | only bad thing was the sheets had a little smell to it plus the front desk manger is very rude will not recommend anyone else to stay in room 4901 smell like piss . Terrible but,1
The staff refused to hold my luggage after check out.Had to walk NYC with my luggage!Terrible!,0
The hire was very clean only thing was the elevator wait every time u went in u were waiting in line and in the morning it look us 45 minutes to go down stairs every elevator was packet but other then that it was a nice hotel the pictures made it look nicer then it was but it's a great location and great price for where ur at,1
Excellent location ! Need some renovation ! Rooms look disgusting. !,0
Times Square view was great cleanliness was good and staff were great,1
I love everything staff was welcome | lady at front desk help me with everything room was clean also I love it there,1
The first room was nasty.... The second room they gave us was no better. The comforter on the bed had feathers coming out of it. The walls had old soda stains on them. Then I ended up paying $200 more than Expedia quoted me when I checked in! I am beyond upset with this trip.,0
Nothing was unique about this stay. When I arrived I noticed right away there was eyelashes on the lamp from the couple before us. What kind of cleaning service do they offer? Especially during these times... so stupid. Then when I tried to shower the shower rod and the shower curtains all fell off! Horrible . I will never stay there again.,0
Great location walkable to many places Clean  room With city view,1
I love the location| was at walk-in minutes from time square and every other attractions and stores. Sadly the restaurant was closed due to COVID-19 but you can find any place to eat all the way around.,1
My room had no wash rags the shower needs to be up dated,1
Great location. Nice stStaff. Parking included! Nice room with s good view of times square.,1
I loved the location and the view from our room. It was lovely,1
I loved the location right in Times Square. My ac in my room didn't work and it took them a long time to fix it.,1
Location was great service smd room poor..no towels when arrive,0
Con:  The hotel charged more than the hotels.com email transaction stated amount.  Also| hotel refused to store bags after checkout. No drinking glasses in the room. No coffee in the room or hotel lobby.Pro:  Location was good.,0
The lamps| tv and dressers were dusty. Doesn't seem like they fully clean.,1
Everything was fine |no complains | I like the hotel,1
There was a leak in the ceiling in the bathroom first night. Next day after we moved they shut the water off with no notice. Unable to shower or use restroom let alone wash our hands in the age of Covid-19. Every time we stepped outside of hotel you could smell THC in front of property. Front desk staff have major attitude problems and poor customer service.,0
Hotel staff were helpful| hotel was clean. Room was clean and in good repair.Loved the location and the free parking| I'm definitely going back. This was 3 nights of our honeymoon| loved the New York Vibe.,1
Good location! Hotel was very clean and staff were polite and courteous,1
I called the office for someone to clean the room & no one ever came. The room was only cleaned the 1st night I stayed there. I went to the office to ask for someone to come take the trash &No one ever came,0
GREAT location| super clean| workers (front desk| security| housekeeping) were all awesome and friendly,1
Could not ask for more,1
Found used panties in room that were not mine and also had to go down to lobby 3 times for them to unlock my door,0
Was a quick overnight.   Room was clean and staff very helpful.,1
The location was amazing! The hotel was clean and definitely up to ddate and on top of Covid policies and procedures. It was beautiful and had amazing views. Definitely will stay again!,1
Nice lobby... good location... friendly checkin... time square view was nice| rooms were a little out dated. No fridge or coffee in the room or hotel. Not quite sure what the resort fee covered| as I tried calling the front desk a total of 4 times to no response and never have I had housekeeping knocking on my door to see if we were ready to check out... quite baffling lol,1
Love the room it was small but it's was still good,1
Great room. Needed to ask for cups but other than that great stay,1
Good service . The only problem was the heat that was too loud and not effec,1
Horrible,0
Wow! I had a feeling i would love this hotel! As soon as i got there the front desk agent was very sweet! My checkin wasnt untill 2 hours later & she managed to give a nice upgraded room with a early check in! I loved how close it was to everything in times square! I will deff be staying here evetytime i visit NY!,1
the streets were dirty there were too many homeless people and the hotel was not clean enough,0
there was a towel with red stains in the bathroom,0
I love my stay I enjoyed the city and the hotel i was spectacular,1
Not a bad place to stay. The location was good and the room was clean.,1
The hotel is horrible| bad attention| rooms worse. They never cleaned our room| no fridge in the room. The only good thing about the hotel is the location| but there are plenty of hotels with the same location and better. I do not recommend it at all.,0
Everything was nice and clean. Will stay again.,1
Needs upgrade and more cleaning especially with the current situation. Staff is ok but the service they are allowed to provide makes the whole disappointing,0
This hotel was not so clean the room have a bad smell. There not soapto. Wash your hands and not a even a plastic cup toUsed to rinse my teeth  I paid to stay here To have no soap to wash my hands And face no a single plastic cup Anda bad smell una room .very bad experience.a lot of noise in the top floor ofMusic.iwill try to talk to the manager because I should paid 0 to statin this hotel Stay way from this place,0
Decent view of Times Square| nice sized room and bathroom.,1
I didn't like that the hotel had NO HEAT.. floor 35 had a foul odor ... The customer service was awesome..,0
Walls are so thin you can hear everything from every side of your walls. Nothing is private here. Some staff are not friendly| not helpful and they laugh at you or judge you with whatever you look or appearance. But the rooms are clean and hallways are kept in clean and good condition. So that's a plus point for them. Other than that well they are ok.,0
Bedrooms only clean but without microwave and refrigerator| hotel is close to everything but inside don't have nothing so bad I never want back over there,0
Great location| good city views. The only thing I was expecting for the room I got was a small fridge but there was not a fridge.,1
front desk and housekeeping NEVER Answered the phone. It was mission impossible to get towels or anything. Then the toilet flooded and we told themAnd hours passed by and no one ever came. Then the entire room flooded and we went to front desk to alert them again and no one still came. They gave us another room but it didn't matter bc our flight was a few hours away so needless to SAY OUR LAST DAY AND NIGHT THERE WAS HORRID. Don stay there if u have a choice.,0
Very good service and the room was nice and clean with a decent view,1
Old| and dusty!!!,0
I Loved it me and my and daughter enjoyed the stay for 2 days,1
I thought parking was free. It was not they added another 25 dollars. So the deposit turned out to be 50 dollars and only 25 dollars to be returned.,1
I had a great experience here. Definitely will be back.,1
Doesn't look as good as it does on pictures. Paid for a city view to then get moved to another room because our shower was filthy. Beds are uncomfortable and didn't have any cups or toilet paper in the room,0
Beautiful room with an amazing view. I had Great experience! I will definitely return,1
TERRIBLE!!! we got a deluxe room. When we walked inside the room there it smelt like complete cigarettes smoke as well as marijuana. There was nasty liquid like all over bed frame. I have pictures to prove| bathroom floors all dirty| mold inside the bathtub corners| I don't even know if the sheets were changed because there were dirty sheets| I tried calling the front desk 20 times NO ANSWER. I then switched to a different room. I guess was a little better than last one but no difference. I shouldn't have had to experience that first situation. Absolutely DISGUSTING. I will be uploading pictures and contacting higher management!!!! I will never ever stay here and I recommend nobody stays here. Customer service is HORRIBLE THEY NEVER ANSWER THE PHONE. There was a man in the room next door that kept us up all night. Banging on the door asking for whoever was in the room to let him in. He kept banging and screaming curse words. We tried calling downstairs because my friend and I were too scared to leave our room and go to the lobby because the man was outside screaming and banging on the hotel door for whomever was in the room with him to let him in. We had to sit through a big argument of theres the whole night. Downstairs was not answering phones at all. Such a terrible experience!!!!!!,0
The services is the worst n the hotel facilities not good front desk don't help you for nothing| the the employee the are not very friendly,0
It was comforting and was clean. Everything was convenient,1
Excellent place. Excellent location. My boyfriend and I loved it,1
Hotel was very clean and only a few steps from Times Square,1
My air conditioner didn't work but they fixed and the technician was exelent!!! It was good!  I think I'll come back!,1
Is not what you spect| they offer free parking and at the end you have to pay. I not recommend this hotel.,0
Price was ok for the Labor Day weekend. Tolilet tank was liking and the duvet was very thin| the room was too cold and the thermostat was not working well it was too cold or too hot. I won't be staying there.,0
Worst hotel ever. The water on the shower was yellow. No lights on the hall. And the rooms are not properly cleaned.,0
The front desk were super friendly. Clean room with an a nice Times Square view.,1
Called for room service 7 times no one picked up| called front desk no one picked up. Could not get my needs met while being here| it was unfortunate,0
Amazing front desk staff. Extremely kind and helpful. I stayed at the hotel 8/15 for my sisters 50th birthday and the two man were both so kind and helpful. Thank you guys for making her stay a memorable one. I'm sorry I forgot your names but won't forget your Hospitality. I will definitely  be back. Thank youuuu,1
The room picture was really misleading. My room was clean- it just want not what I expected,0
I reserved a king room and they stuck me in a smaller queen room.,0
I reserved a room on Friday night for a studio suite king size bed (ball drop view). Let me tell you that is far from what that was. I walked into a room that was only a full size bed with no view what so ever. They falsely advertised so they can bring in guests. I went back down immediately and told the receptionist this is not the room i reserved. Mind you there there about 3-4 other parties there for the same reason. All of them very upset as i was. They weren't reasonable at all and i Kindly asked her to cancel the room so i can book else where. She did do that but the thing is i never got refunded for the room. Im furious.,0
Wrong room| over charged. Bugs all in the room. Smelt like smoke. Wasn't even the hotel we were supposed to be going to.,0
Long of the short I received several HIDDEN charges on my credit card I was not aware of after check out on Sunday July 12th. The dates listed are INCORRECT I checked in on Friday July 10th checked out on Sunday July 12th. The room was NEVER cleaned our entire stay. SECOND trip to NY and SECOND disappointing hotel stay in NY. Can't reach accounting to get explanation of charges considering I paid for room up front.,0
It was close to Times Square which was great and it's right up from good morning America studio. Had view of New Years ball drop much smaller than what they have on tv. But it was still cool.  No fan in bathrooms. No fridge in rooms. On website it says they have parking but they don't you have to go to garage across from hotel it ranges $55-$65 a day depending on your vehicle. That should be stated on their page.,1
This was the worst hotel I have ever been to. The power was off all night I asked for someone to come fix the lights in my room. They told me someone will be up shortly and no one ever came. I will never pay money to stay there again. So dissatisfied.,0
Location was great. Check in staff were all ways to help.,1
Love location close to bar restaurants shopping staff very friendly enjoy the room very clean and I definitely will recommend this hotels to friends and family,1
Have stayed here several times. Great convenient location to all we want -theaters| restaurants| transportation. We'll be back.,1
Property wasn't clean enough but employees very nice and helpful,1
Great location and nice lobby. I think the room I was in was outdated and the bed sheets were coarse. Prefer softer sheets,1
Unbeatable location| friendly staff and great sized room!,1
Location is perfect. Clean. Easy check in. Accommodating staff.,1
Great location| really nice staff| good parking| will stay again,1
Pictures on website was not the same in person. I was a little dissappointed,0
Grear locationRoom is outdated A lot of mold in the room,1
This property is in a good location for tourists coming to Times Square or to. See a show. Unfortunately| the rooms are in desperate need of a facelift.,0
Great location nice exterior and lobby staff nice but busy and not answering phone calls at front desk regularly,1
Bathroom and toilet area was broken down,0
Great property.  Clean room and very friendly staff.,1
The location is awesome. The front desk and concerige were very nice and helpful.Lobby dark| but looks good.Housekeeping very friendly always saying hi.The hallways and rooms definitely needs upgrades.  I was on the 19th floor| the wallpaper was torn in front of the elevators.The room I was in was large. Great TV| nice selection of channels| even Netflix!  I would definitely recommend it and stay here again!,1
Hotel was in poor shape.  Tubs would not drain| towels had holes| counters were cracked. filth in crevices next to bed. Beds were hard and not comfortable.    Great location| but hotel is long overdue on a makeover and refresh.,0
Delux room advertised as a room with a city view. Upon arrival it was not at all what was advertised. The view was of an alley way. Stuffy and dark. The fixtures were old and sink stopper hard to pull up so the sink filled with dirty water. Management did not provide a room| rather suggested offering 25% off of a room that was not available,0
Waited 30 minutes to check in/ get my room key My room got relocated| staff was basically like too bad.,0
The location is excellent| right in the heart of so many things and good restaurants nearby. All of the staff were amazing - efficient| friendly| helpful and knowledgeable,1
Rubin was so nice! The hotel was in good condition and so close to everythjng,1
Top floor with a spectacular view couldn't ask for more! Not to mention I was allowed to re-rent the room with the serene view a couple of times in a row,1
That you could check in items at the front desk if you didn't want to keep them in your room! Not to mention free of charge,1
The hotel has two entrances which makes it easy to access the streets on either side. I liked the beautiful artwork. And the baggage hold area made it easy to site see without carrying around our luggage.,1
This is the only hotel I stay at when i come to NYC. Very spacious and clean. The front desk people are nice too...,1
The problem was with Expedia There were issues with billing and payment. I had prepaid for my stay. Because of the issues with Expedia and Hotel I had to pay again for first night ($215) while the issue was resolved. Not impressed at all with Expedia. Hotel staff was good.,1
Proximity to Times Square/Theater district.  Hotel staff was excellent.,1
The staff were very helpful in every way. The location was very convenient. It was a large hotel with a boutique hotel feel.,1
Very good! Excellent location! Two thumbs up! Asian restaurant was awesome.,1
Overall great location| good room. The bathroom had difficulties when we arrived. But would stay again.,1
Old but comfortable. Room service is needed. No minibar| I had to go out to buy a bottle of water.,1
No tea or coffee facilities in room which was disappointing staff didnt look that happy either,1
Had a great time while staying at the Millenium; however| the AC did not work very well in the room.,1
Great location to time square great views & really spacious roomsüëçüëç,1
I was charged an urban tax per room and was not aware of it when I was shopping. Also| the entire building smelled like marijuana.,0
Really like staying hear! Great location and a place to put your luggage until you room is ready as well as after you check out! Enjoy my stay and would stay hear again!,1
Great location. Reasonable parking deals. The only complaint was the bed. Probably the hardest one I've experienced at a hotel.,1
Location and room size were very significant attributes,1
Clean and comfortable hotel with nice staff and a very convenient location. This hotel is a great deal.,1
It was very close to Times Square and the two broadway shows we attended. The staff was attentive| friendly| and helpful.,1
Quite and safe.. Ill come back 1000 times over for that peace of mind,1
The cleaner took out my desert that I have not finished yet.When I came back to my room| my desert remaining on the desk was disappeared.,1
The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating.  They took their time to tell me how to get around the city.  One employee had actually clocked out for the day but took the time to walk me to the subway and show me how to use the transit system (they then went upstairs to get their car and go home).,1
I didn't like the $50 fee they charged because we reserved with Expedia.,1
Loved the location and the friendly and helpful staff.,1
Proximity to Times Square - we had a view of the New Year Ball!,1
Location of the hotel is the only positive.  Bed were  hard as a rock. No proper ventilation in the room.  Nasty bathroom. Sheets had hair on them and it wasn't ours since we just had walked in.  Never again!,0
"I would never give this hotel business. First| we arrived at 11:30 am and checked in--no room ready (that's ok) but we have ""a special room for you."" I had paid for a room with two double beds (there were 3 of us).  Give us your number and we'll call you when it's ready. We checked our bags & headed out. At 4 we had not heard from the hotel but we had dinner reservations so wanted to freshen up and relax. Got on line| got our room. Nothing was said. We got up to floor 45 to find a room with one king bed. Brought our things back downstairs. Back on line. Explained the situation to the clerk. He got the manager| they had overbooked their 2-bed rooms. They had upgraded our room and would bring in a cot. Not happy with their choice or lack of communication. Manager said we can cancel your reservation with no charge. Seriously? It's past 4| we've driven in from 4 hours away| have reservations and tickets to Phantom at 8. It's snowing. Sure--we'll just cancel the reservation and DO WHAT? So I said| fine but please make sure the cot is in the room and made up by the time we get back from the show at 11 pm. Of course| I am told. We left hotel at 5:30 and I stopped by the front desk to make sure the extra bed would be ready when we returned. Arrived back around 11:30 pm. Bed in corner standing up. Called front desk. Explained. Transferred to housekeeping. 15 minutes later| man who speaks NO English came in| put bed down| left. I had to move and make the bed myself at almost midnight.",0
This property had some of the best staff I have ever encountered at a hotel. Thomas (concierge) and Brian (manager) were top-tier professionals who care about the customers' stays. The first night we stayed in a room with an amazing view| but very uncomfortable bed. We spoke to Brian| and he moved us to a more updated room with a more comfortable bed| and said the other rooms were eventually going to be redone as well| better beds included. Thomas helped us with reservations and show tickets. Doormen were amazing as well. Great service all around!,1
Well located. The bathroom needs better maintenance.,1
The property location was great. Right in Times Square| easy access to transportation| food| and sights.,0
Loved the view| loved that it was close to Times Square. Missed tissues & extra towels in the room. We were a couple & only have two large towels. Asked for extra towels the next day & hiuse keeping never came Wish they had room service. Overall| nice hotel. Nice room. Nice staff.,1
Location was great for seeing shows. However| the beds are horrible and the pillows must be 20 years old. They give you one thin cover that looks so sad. I called for an additional blanket but had to call three times and then that blanket was pathetic. Old and itchy and thin. Also| at 1:00am an alarm went off that sent us into a panic and took 30 minutes for the hotel to tell us everything was fine. In the meantime| we heard the fire trucks - so clearly we were upset and then took us 1.5 hours to go back to sleep. The next day| no apologies| no inquiry how are stay was - we were completely invisible to the staff. It also took forever to check in because there was one person checking people in.,0
This was a perfect location. Syen the gentleman at the front desk was awesome |a beautiful room with a city view .  I would stay again,1
Fantastic location in Times Square. The price was excellent and the staff were very accommodating.,1
Close to Times Square| safe location| prompt check in and out|,1
The view of our room was amazing and the location is right at Time Square.,1
Very dirty| unable to check in until several hours passed check in time| while in line to check in several customers had problems with their reservations| rooms and rates.,0
Very strategic location and friendly staff. Place is sparkling clean and service is super quick,1
Room was BOILING HOT! They had no A/C and we asked for a fan to get some air and they did not have a fan. Told us to crack a window| which did nothing. Room and hotel was very| very dated and needs a lot of TLC. Great location but could use a lot of work to get it up to date!,0
It was an amazing experience. Huge room and friendly service.,1
Hotel was at the center of everything. Conveniently located. Great staff. Room was clean and quiet. Totally enjoyed our vacation. Will definitely be back when returning to NY,1
We liked the view from our room and the location of the hotel (close to Time Square).,1
Our room was dirty when we arrived with rubbish in the room| and all the drawers were left open. The staff were not the most helpful but eventually gave us another room,0
"Run down property. Room with cot wasnt available even though i called a month in advance and was assured it would be. Family slept on 2 doubles that were like rocks. Pillows aweful too. Wife and i both got stiff necks. Bathroom was a diaster with the slowest tub drain you can imagine. Mold along the side. Disgusting. Staff downstairs were no better. 1 guy working while 3 stand around with a line out the door to get checked bags. Very rude.staff. Desk clerk was yelling at folks not to get in line if they were just checking.out. Others were complaining too. We heard a desk clerk say to someone| ""you shouldnt have booked on a travel site if you wanted a king room"" really unbeleivable! The millenium hotel is stuck in the year 2000!",0
Ac damaged. Dirty walls. Bad service and forgot towers,0
The location of this property is the only positive selling point ... the hotel rooms are extremely outdated. The rooms were felt like they weren't cleaned well enough| it's an uncomfortable feeling. The comfort of the beds were terrible. The mattresses had body formed indentations in them. The hotel needs a total renovation! No basic amenities either like a Refrigerator or ice bucket. Nothing,0
The hotel was great.  Very clean  and comfortable and the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating.  A little noisy at times but it is New York City and close to Times Square so to be expected.It would have been nice to have mini-fridges in the room.,1
A lovely | well placed| great comfort| excellent service and services| great access to everything the city has to offer.,1
Property had a great location.  We had some cold showers| the bathroom wasn't very clean and our faucet leaked even after they fixed it.,1
Good location and the hotel was once a nice place to stay.  Now it is run down. The onsite restaurant is awful| no room service| no drinking water in the room| no mini bar.,0
Great location and friendliness of all employees. The building is old and desperately needs some maintenance. Hotel: clean| employees really try to keep it cleanRoom: Wallpaper is all vracked and peeling| bleach stains in carpet| we got a corner room and one side was practically useless as it was stained with some white substance (from the outside). Pillows are a joke (very flat and thin). Floor in bathroom is cracked| toilet cover didnt even fit and making a lot of noise at nights. Disappointed there was no mini fridge in room.,1
Hotel ideally located. Clean...decor a bit dated but only used as a base for our stay in NYC.,1
This was not our first stay at the Millennium.  We really enjoy this hotel and the spacious room sizes.  It is located in the heart of the theatre district and all of our fun adventures were within walking distance.  It's an older hotel and our room showed some wear and tear in the bathroom where the door was sticking upon closing. Other than that we truly enjoy this hotel and would highly recommend. The concierge was helpful in obtaining tickets for an almost sold out show. Very helpful. We should mention the restaurant was nice but could use a few more choices on the menu. Only negative this year was the music playing throughout the main floor and restaurant...it was awful! At Christmas time we would have enjoyed hearing Christmas music.,1
Location we like but the room was hot. The staff is always friendly and helpful,1
Every member of staff we met were absolutely charming.  Especially the door men who were forever cheerful and eager to help.  The hotel rooms are a little dated but generally of fair standard.  The hotel foyer is beautiful.,1
I liked how it was close but not too close to Times Square and Rockefeller center,1
Good hotel with quiet room. Situated in heart of Times Square activity.Downside | no tea making facilities in room. Not even a glass to drink water.,1
Beautiful building| inside and out. Friendly staff and security is awesome! Highly recommend! Five Stars!!,1
Is not what i was expecting  they put me in different room and no microwave no refrigerator nothing,0
Good hotel | in the heart of manhattan.  We'll be back. Highly recommended!,1
Soooo old| the room pictures aren't true. Great location tho,0
Excellent location. Excellent view. Fantastic corner room!,1
It seemed like a good location on Time Square. We were supposedly moved higher up in floors for a ‚Äúbetter view‚Äù but it was not a great view. The person who checked us in was condescending when I asked him if we had a ‚Äúball drop view‚Äù.,1
No fridge|  no microwave| no coffee pot...bed was like sleeping on the floor| outdated halls and room. Great location and staff were great .,0
Convenient and in walking distance to a lot. The staff was very accomodating,1
The place isn't really sincronizar|with servics |at late my room at noon with anything in door in nobody|clean the place.The courting that is really important|cause |I was in 47 floor after 6:00AM is a lot light.dont work.at the time that getting out from the Hotel the people the take care the luggage|left my luggage in the side |I did giving to He |at good tick.everthing is sad.I don't recommend|to anyone to stay there|with the money the this people charge,1
Rooms need a renovation,0
What I like about this hotel is the location. What I didn't like: first at checking the front desk agent told me that I didn't have a reservation| even after I showed him the confirmation number| after a couple of minutes he replayed back saying‚Äùyou are here‚Äù his name is Tanbir R.In the room:The bathtub has hair on it as well as the bathroom floor.The picture in bathroom got some white stain( tooth paste)The exhaust in the bathroom was extremely dirty and dustyIn the room; the carpet was dirty ( very dirty)The wallpaper was damaged and extremely dirty(coffee and food stain)The bed was the worse| I found blood on the blanket| the bed was not made properly ( missing a sheet)I have pictures of all of the above in case is need it.,0
It is in a great location with nice rooms and an excellent concierge service,1
Location was excellent. Clean and proper room that I would highly recccomend!,1
It would be nice if the rooms had small refrigerator and coffee maker. The hotel restaurant closes to early.,1
Decent rooms with amazing location. If you don't care about service (no room service| parking| etc... or any other services) then this is the right place.,0
Great location (a block from times square) and overall good hotel.  Clean room| good staff...definitely will try to stay here again.,1
Very outdated. Dirty rooms. Beds were rock hard and linens felt like plastic. Great location| but hardly a 4 star hotel.,0
We really enjoyed the stay at this hotel. The hotel is clean| the service is great and the staff members are very hospitable and friendly. The best part about the hotel is the proximity to times square (it's right around the corner of broadway street).,1
Incredible location right off Times Square| friendly staff and clean/comfortable room.  The only issue we had was the heat| but I think that's a NYC thing| not specific to Millenium.  Everywhere you go| it's 80+ degrees inside with the heat blasting.  We actually left our windows open at night (38 degrees) to cool off a bit.,1
I've stayed at this hotel plenty of times and it's always my go to when traveling to New York. I love that it's literally in the middle of Times Square and close to everything. If you need a good workout the gym is almost always empty and has a nice clean bathroom/shower which is always super important. The staff is always helpful| friendly and accommodating. I always recommend this hotel to any of my friends and family members. Also the views are unmatched if you choose the Times Square view and request a high floor prior to arriving. I love everything about this hotel.,1
Fantastic location... staff at check-in and the lady at the concierge desk where all amazing.,1
I never stayed at hotel so dirty like this one. Rooms are yucky. Carpets are horribly dirty and windowsills and chair also dirty. Bed linens seemed clean| at least for God's sake. Depending on the hours of the day| elevators were extremely crowded and you would take forever to get in them. People were using the stairs. There is no room service it seems. The only positive thing about this hotel is its location. For those who want to stay in Times Square| it is steps distance to everything. Other than that| I don't see anything else positive about this hotel. It is very yucky.,0
I loved the service and the staff were very friendly. The hotel lobby is really nice and the room was clean| I read the reviews and decided to give it a tried since they were not so good. I was not disappointed at all. Ok so the room needed a little touch up here and there but nothing to the point i wanted to run out the bed was really comfortable. I will definitely stay here again!,1
Perfect location. Close to Times Square| Grand Central| Macy's| Rockefeller etc. Staff were amazingly kind| helpful and very friendly. Rooms a little outdated but totally fine for our needs. You only sleep there so 100% would recommend,1
They messed up my bill majorly. They were no help at all with where to park my vehicle. The time to check in and out was ridiculous. The room was way too hot and the heat wouldn't shut off. The water in the tub wouldn't drain,0
Sueallen was so rude and the over night manager is so cheep.,0
This hotel is perfect for Times Square and shopping. You could not get a better location.,1
Best location in nyc. The staff were lovely and we had a wonderful stay,1
The hotel's location is excellent for sightseeing and theatergoing!  But from the online photos| I was under the impression that we would have a larger room.  I would have liked a small refrigerator| microwave| or room service.,1
The property location was perfect to Times Square and all the major attractions.  I did not receive my 5:00 am wake up call.üòî,1
The location was perfect.  We arrived in NYC prior to being able to check in and they held our luggage for us so we could see the town.Beds a bit hard maybe need updated| but sleep-able.  We plan on staying here again next trip.,1
Great place to stay| the staff was very friendly and helpful| close to everything. The carpet in our room should be shampooed but that was my only complaint. I will definitely stay here and recommend this hotel.,1
Beautiful hotel. To bad the restaurant isn't American food.,1
Great location & fair price. Lots of staff; all quite friendly and happy to help. Rooms a little outdated but extremely spacious compared to other nearby hotels and not much to complain about. Hot water| hair dryer| room service daily| fridge| water bottles| towels etc. Everything was great.,1
Location is perfect only plus| the bathroom was covered in mould| the furniture was scratched and bad condition.,0
Hotel is really run down.,0
I didn't like that you have to pay extra for a microwave and fridge. Also the bathroom could have been cleaner. Location was perfect.,1
Great room... Very large.... Awesome view.. Great Central location... Clean... Nice staff.... Would definitely stay here again.,1
It is really centered in Times Square. Everything is near.,1
The staff was so kind. Especially the bell captains - so helpful. He even gave me his umbrella so I could stay dry getting into my cab. He also graciously took my Juniors Cheesecake garbage so I didn't have to bring it in the cab.,1
Location. Large clean rooms. Concierge was very nice and helpful.,1
The bathrooms not equipped with fans the pillow cases were left dirty,1
The location of this hotel is ideal| which is why it was very disappointing of how outdated it was. The rooms are so old it was mold in the bathroom| the rooms smelled horrible i had to buy something to keep it fresh. The windows are so dirty you barely can see out of them.. the staff at check in was nice| however the staff and check out was horrible i asked him to explain the extras charges at check out of an urban destination fee which i was not aware of. They did not explain it to me only said i was being charge for a shuttle service i was not aware of or ever saw. I come to new york a lot but i will not be visiting this hotel again.,0
The location was very good. Right in Times Square| two blocks from Subway| close to Penn Station| great deli across the street. Very nice city view from the room. Staff was pleasant.,1
Great location| just off Times Square. Easy to get anywhere in Manhattan from there. Subways 2 blocks in each direction. Rooms were clean and spacious. Only complaint is the mattress was too hard and so were the pillows.,1
We have stayed here multiple times. But| it's starting to show its age. It needs an update. Wallpaper is starting to peel| carpeting in the room was starting to look a little worn. And I was extremely disappointed there is no refrigerator in the room. That is a major oversight. Especially since I use insulin and I need to refrigerate the insulin. Can't recall a hotel in New York that we have stayed in over the years that did not have a refrigerator.,1
No coffee service in the rooms. Did not have soap in room when we arrived. Overall room was good and location of the hotel was excellent. Would definitely stay here again.,1
Perfect location for sightseeing. Room was very clean.Front desk staff and concierge were exceptionally nice. Would definitely recommend.,1
I loved how close to Times Square the hotel was and just how close it was to everything. It made wandering the city so easy.,1
This hotel needs a deep cleaning. The deodorizer overpowered the room. We felt like we were breathing in a can of febreze. The carpets in our room were dirty. There were literally dark spots everywhere and a sticky spot near the bed. The furniture had scratches and the hinge on  cabinet under tv was broken. The bathroom is just gross. Black in the grout and cracks in tile. When we checked in we had 2 bath & hand towels and no washcloths. Housekeeping quickly delivered washcloths and more towels. The bed was fairly comfortable. Don't think we will be staying here anymore :-(.,0
Didn't like tired decor. WiFi was good. No hotel info in room. No coffee.,1
Great location| very clean room| could do with a tea/coffee maker and fridge in room.,1
Very conveniently located hotel overlooking Times Square. Easy walking to Broadway| subway| NBC| FIX| and ABC filming locations. Overpriced| with no coffee pot in room| but good for NYC.,1
Central Location. Found a lot of dust in unseen places.,1
Great hotel| great location| kind and wonderful service| good breakfast.  Great environment.,1
Great Location. Great food on the same street.Extremely nice people working there. We will be staying there again. I have recommended this hotel to everyone wanting to come to NYC. Loved our stay there.it was my husbands first trip to the City and he says he will go back. Loved it there,1
Great Option. Location is unbeatable and price is perfect!  This is a great hotel In the center of  all.  It is located in the heart of Times Square and  Theatre District.  The room views are great| and the rooms are  in good condition.With so many choices for transportation| seeing New York is easy| you can walk to nearby metro stations including Times Sq. - 42 St.  plenty of restaurants| bars/lounges| shopping.... This hotel is in the heart  of everything.,1
It is so close to Times Square and central to all shopping.  Rooms are large and clean| bed is comfortable| rooms have a safe so you don't  have to take all your cash with you and it even has a cozy bar in the lobby where you can sit and relax and have a drink before you end your night.  Love| love| love this hotel.....,1
Richard at the theater desk was really helpful.  The man who brought up my bags was sweet. It was my understanding that I booked a Deluxe room with a view of Broadway; I could see a little tiny sliver of one of the screens from the street tucked behind all of the huge buildings surrounding the hotel. So| that was not an accurate description of the view. And| I wish that the room had a refrigerator; in fact| it had an empty cabinet that looked like it may have once had a refrigerator in it. And| the safe didn't work. And| they really need to install lamps with outlets in them on the nightstand. I couldn't use my phone while in bed because it had to be plugged in across the room. The room was clean| though| and the beds were comfortable. The best thing about the hotel is the location. It is literally in Times Square.,1
Walking distance to Times Square. Great location!! Just wish the check in time could be a little earlier than its 4pm.,1
Location was perfect especially for access to Times Square and the theatre area.,1
This property is in the heart of the square and within walking distance of much to eat| do| and see. The view of the city from the room on the 49th floor was awesome! They have a concierge who is very knowledgeable and friendly. The staff there seem to have too many guests to provide the exceptional service expected for a hotel that you pay top dollar for. I have medical issues that require refrigeration for my medication. Their refrigerators are available upon request. It was communicated as a need prior to arrival| reiterated at check-in| and requested two more times before it was finally delivered the evening of day two of a three night stay. Each time| the person spoken with claimed to not have known about the former requests| and that was inconvenient and annoying.It's a great place to stay for convenience| cleanliness| and room view. If you have special needs or require assistance| I suggest staying someplace else.,0
It was very convenient to all of the Broadway plays we went to see.  There were enough restaurants close by that we were able to walk to supper and our plays.  The breakfast buffet in the hotel was also very good.,1
Excellent location!  The rooms were clean and the staff was so helpful!,1
Didn't get the room we booked| towels were stained| lamp was broken staff not friendly| room was dirty. Beds were horrendous| can't believe I paid so much money to stay there. Pictures are not really what the rooms are like,0
Awesome stay only issue was that we couldn't find the tv remote but wasn't major obviously,1
Bed is to hard to sleep on. I will never pay my money to stay there again,0
A step away from Time Square! Clean| well maintained rooms that are much larger then you would expect when staying the in the heart of Manhattan!,1
We were a girls trip| 4 sharing a room with 2x double beds. Room was fine| beds comfortable| didn't notice any noise. Lifts were all fast (last visit very slow and waiting along time). Bathroom in room - needs a little more cleaning around sink area. Towels were changed daily. Staff all very helpful,1
Great hotel| only problem was the bar they closes very early. But they didn't tell us until we bought a drink that it closed in 5 min and we couldn't get any more drinks...,1
Called in as to items left in room |attendant on phone wouldn't even double check to see if 3 shirts left in closet. Will never recommend this hotel.,0
Beautiful building! Great staff. The pocation wss perfect,1
I had a great experience. I was surprised to receive an upgraded room the moment i checked in. The view was amazing. Overall| i had an amazing trip,1
This was one of the worst hotels ive ever stayed at. Our initial room was so awful we asked to be switched. The 1st room had yellow stains in the tub. The 2nd one wasn't any newer| but it was slightly cleaner.,0
Great location| clean rooms and the staff was awesome.,1
This hotel's location is perfectly situated. It is close to Broadway shows| great restaurants and sits in Times Square. We would definitely stay there again!,1
Here's the good thing: if you are there for the theaters| it's a really nice location. The concierge and the doorman are nice. Front desk is ok.Here are the bad things:1. Small room and old facility. Old is fine but closet door and fall off by itself| a hole or strange stain on the bed linen then probably not just old but management issue. Not all New York hotels have small rooms within that price range2. It's too noisy. Times Square is already a sleepless location but you will be able to know what your neighbor is doing3. Surprisingly the house keeping person left the working rubber glove on the table. You know the ones you wear to clean the toilet... If you go there and get sick| it's likely to be related to issues like this.,0
The room I stayed in was very old and outdated| the beds were not queen size| as that was advertised as queens| the room was old| the furniture had scratches all over them| there wasn't any microwave or fridge available| the bathroom sink was clogged. Didn't like it at all.,0
I like the fragrance in the air when you walk in. Location was perfect,1
Booked it on Expedia with breakfast| when we checked in | we been told your reservation without breakfast. Very disappointing. It's Expedia's scam not the hotel . Make sure when u make a reservation check your email that breakfast include it .,0
Size of room was great for NY standard. Check in and check out were easy even though receptionists could be more friendly. My first room was on the 8th floor| it was noisy and had no view| I called in the manager and he was willing to give me a room on the 31st floor with a view which was nice. Room had no fridge but they provided me one when asked. Overall| great experience for the price I paid.,1
The location of hotel was great and some staff were friendly and helpful. The room which we were upgraded to was dirty and old. The wallpaper was coming off| the carpet was filthy the room was very dusty and dirty. I called housekeeping twice for laundry bags none were in room and extra toilet paper we never received either after falling twice. At check out I was not asked how my stay was I thought that was standard customer service. Very disappointing experience.,0
The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Service and food was great.,1
Overpriced poor room cleaning no fridge ..Better hotel in same area at same price,0
Not a great hotel. Staff was rude. Hotel room was ok. Not sparkly clean,0
Loved the location. Staff were great. Very friendly. Rooms are a bit dated compared to some hotels and could do with a makeover but it didnt spoil the experience of New York,1
The room wasn't ventilated properly. Can see wear and tear. However| the staff| location and convince trumps the cleanliness/ventilation area.,1
We couldn't have asked for a better location. We had a corner room looking right down into Times Square. Huge wraparound windows| and a very comfortable bed.,1
Hardest bed Ive EVER slept on. Hotel lonby is great| but rooms need a remodel.  DatedPealing paint on bathroom ceiling| old fixtures| etc.,0
Great location| central to all mid town events| shopping and metro.,1
The property was perfect location. It was close to everything we needed it to be close to. The lobby area smells amazing and all the staff were really nice. Our room was older and outdated and needed some work and I wish we,1
For location and convenience| fine. But this property has not been maintained or improved| and the wear is showing.,0
Location was perfect!!!! Staff were very approachable| knowledgeable| helpful and friendly,1
Great staff!! Great location| great views - close to everything,1
Concierge service was excellent. Overall location was terrific in Times Square area s far as Theater and restaurants . Recommend to anyone staying in Manhattan.,1
Everyone was very nice and helpful!!  Perfect location,1
Great location for our purposes| great view from room.  Those were my two biggies.  Very happy with the stay!,1
Great location| rooms were really good and staff friendly,1
Dated| run down| dirty. Needs a serious overhaul. Will never stay again.,0
Staff was amazing and very helpful. The hotel was of very close proximity of everything.,1
The place is starting to look a little dated and worn,1
Hotel was nice| maybe could use some updates . Would like to have had mini fridge in room for soda.,1
Had a great stay here!  Room was clean an comfortable| and service was friendly.   Perfect location for Times Square and the Theatre District.  Stayed on the 41st floor| so there was no noise from the street with the windows closed.  Air conditioning was quick and effective (this is important in the summer).  Would definitely stay here again.,1
Fantastic hotel in the heart of Times Square. Stylish| clean and quiet with friendly| welcoming staff.,1
Great location.  Convenient for shows and shopping. Subway station very close. Clean and spacious.,1
The service staff at the Millennium Times Square hotel were among the best and friendliest staff we've encountered.  Especially the concierge Tom who provided us great dining recommendations and our housekeeping staff Carina who was simply beyond exceptional on providing us over the top service.  Our bellmen Kevin & Lefon greeted us daily and were always friendly and pleasant to talk to during our stay.  It's because of their friendly|  helpful and pleasant demeanor we look forward to returning to NYC and staying at the MillenniumTimes Square hotel.  Sincerely|Shirley & David Kitchen,1
No dislikes| | was clean| near to activities. Great hospitality,1
Hotel was conveniently in a good locations. Rooms were big.,1
Please provide a microwave in your rooms or somewhere for guest to reheat their food.,1
Great location| fair rates| helpful staff. We have stayed there before and will stay there again.,1
Location was great. View was awesome. Ice machines didn't work,1
Loved the location and how nice the hotel is overall,1
More attention required around cleaning the room.  Rooms require upgrading,0
Elegant building beautiful lobby pleasant room . Right next to time square,1
It was great| but the bathroom wasn't clean| and the room was filled with dust throughout it.Sunday| the elevators we limited to only 3 working| and it took us approx 1 hour to get from the 31st floor to the lobby.  Just unacceptable guys.,1
Friendly staff and smack in the middle of Times Square|,1
Rooms are much larger than other hotels we've stayed at in nyc. The proximity to the theaters is a feature that keeps us coming back.,1
It was nice and closed to everything. It's just around Time Square.,1
I did not  like that my room did not automatically include a mini fridge inside it.  In addition I assumed the mattresses in the room would be softer,1
Great location. However| the bathroom needs to be renovated. Plumbing fixtures loose| tub/caulking unattractive| need taller toilets| etc. modernize the baths. Put in showers.,1
Location| staff| clean| not noisy| accesible| location,1
My stay here was okay; convenient. My issues were: cheap and paper thin sheets| definitely not enough outlets in the room| couldn't change the temperature on the thermostat so it was either keep it at 65 degrees or turn it off| and the water pressure in the shower was quite ridiculous- way too powerful.,1
Good location| friendly helpful staff and very clean,1
The guy on reception when we arrived was very helpful and welcoming| and he even upgraded our room. The hotel in general was clean| and all the staff were helpful| the only downside was the breakfast which was truly awful !! My advice is to go out of the hotel and find your own restaurant| which are plentiful. Overall I would rate our experience has a 7/10,1
Location was close to Times Square and the theaters. Perfect location.,1
This is the 4th time we have stayed while seeing a show and visiting NYC.  The location| facility| staff and price are ideal.,1
Great location great staff and clean place will go back anytime,1
The location was excellent. Almost every activity we participate in was walking distance. Easy access also to biblical transportion.,0
very close to Times Square and subway. very nice hotel,1
Our bathroom ceiling was stained and peeling. Also the door would not close without alot of effort. 2 people from engineering came to see the problem door| 1 on Tuesday saying it would be fixed on Wednesday - it wasn't. The 2nd came on Wednesday when I called again and he fixed it partially. He also told me someone would come on Thursday as long as I contacted the front desk on my way out which I did but it still wasn't fixed when we returned to our room after the Yankees game that evening.,0
Great location right at Times Square.Great helpful staff.,1
Had a great view| staff was friendly and had a overall good experience.,1
Great location for all that Times Square and Broadway have to offer,1
The place was awesome great location the staff was very friendly and helpful a little older place but would recommend,1
Right at times square| easy to get to everything. Staff was helpful.,1
The staff and employees were all so kind and accommodating| The housekeepers were amazing and sweet and the absolute best!!!! The one thing I didn't like about the hotel is that was no water fountain station to fill up my water bottle before heading out or coming back to the room for the night. But thankfully the staff would fill it up for me in the back and made me love them even more haha,1
This hotel was in a good location and the staff was nice. The only problem with the room was the drain was broken so we couldn't take a bath| but we preferred showers anyway. So why did it get a low score from me? Because there customer service thereafter is terrible. They took $50 a night for a security deposit. Okay reasonable. After we checked out they kept $114 of it. I tried to call the hotel| they keep telling me to get in contact with accounting. They forward me to them| I left a message the first 2 times| and the last 2 my call won't even go through to accounting. So I tried to call the US Corporate Office that they have listed on their website. Neither of those work. As long as you expect to pay a security deposit and not get it all back| then by all means stay at this hotel| just know what you are getting into beforehand,0
Location is the only positive about the property. Everything else was disappointing.,0
Everything was lovely!,1
Great convient property. Very clean and the rooms were a decent size.  Great overall experience.,1
How close it was to times square. Great staff and amazing hotel! We will definitely be back.,1
There was an issue at the beginning of the stay. But the management more than made uo for it.,1
Location - perfect.Older hotel - needs updatingRestaurant and bar needs to be redone,1
Great location! Staff is very professional and friendly.,1
Loved our stay here. Right on Times Square and a great price for the location. We were a family of 4 with a 4 and a 6 year old. They loved it. 1 min walk over the road to The Lion King. Felt totally safe walking as a female with my 6 year old son too.,1
View was amazing but the windows looking out were very dirty so it was a little disappointing.,1
It is so close to Times Square and was a great location for the children.,1
Room was spacious but staff was not friendly or welcoming,0
Everything about the hotel was perfect except the lines to check in.  There were only 2 people working on a Saturday for check in and we waited for over an hour.,1
Location good| room spacious and very nice.  Only negative was not enough people at front desk for check in.,1
The property was in a great location and was always neat and clean.,1
So close to everything!Big room... sheets were wonderful,1
The hotel is far below the standard of a five star hotel. They messed up our reservation and it takes whole day trying to call back the hotel reservation department. The switchboard is a mess. Kept dropping the calls| and wont connect.,0
The room is okay and a bit rundown.,0
Room in ooor order  ripoed carpet and faulty lights. Needed to be moved,0
No ice| no coffee |have enjoyed the hotel before but this time the room was disappointing,0
Everything great. Never could get the internet on my I- phone after the first 36 hours.  Hotel associates and operator tried to assist but to no avail.,1
Cool fragrant main lobby.  Allowed us early check in.  Lots of elevators. Close to so many Broadway shops and activities.  Loved it!,1
We arrived and had to wait until 4:00 to check in. They did take our bags and store them| but gave us a key to the lobby washroom to freshen up and then sent us away. We certainly entertained ourselves at the Sunday Market on Broadway ... but still. Washing up after a long flight in the hotel bathroom with only two stalls and a bunch of other women trying to do the same kind of soured our idea of this place.,1
Great. Loved it.  Would recommend to anyone.  Very nice,1
Wish there was a pool. Otherwise great hotel! Will stay there again for sure!,1
What a fabulous hotel| and the people who staff it are second to none. I can't say enough about Ruben Gonzalez at the front desk. He seemed to do all he could to make our stay delightful and he educated us on everything from how to avoid traffic to where to shop to how great Manhattan tap water is!  Ruben is just one reason we love the Millennium Times Square| but he made us feel terrific.,1
Very pleased with the hotel and staff.,1
The location and staff were awesome! Our bathroom wasn't clean when we arrived.,1
I would have liked to have something written paper in the room to advise me as to what amenities were available versus having it on the TV. A coffee pot in the room would have been nice and even though we could ask for one and did receive it we did not receive coffee supplies and had to call for them daily.,1
Location was great! First time in NYC and with as much as NYC is spread out it was as central as it could be.,1
Such a convenient location! Easy to get to the major sites| within walking distance of a few!,1
Horrible. All around. The property was out dated. I ignored the other reviews| and then was up at 2:30 am booking a better hotel in upper west side,0
Overall a very nice hotel with good accommodations in a central location of NYC. Liked the cleanliness| room size and quality. Staff who took bags and did check-in were nice. Would have liked better management of lines at front desk and elevators sometimes were packed or slow to arrive. Kept calling the desk from the room; no one picked up.,1
"Thank God we were able to catch one going back up!  To add insult to injury| they have the NERVE to charge a ""Resort Fee"" which is laughable.  I guess they consider climbing and going down 30 flights of stairs a designer fitness gym!!?? But I will say this... the photographer they hired to take room photos is truly gifted.",0
Very clean I had a large room. I did not receive the upgrade or higher floor I was promised however after informing the hotel regarding this I received a personal message from Mr Bryan Joseph Front Office Manager who assisted me and ensured that the remaining time in the Millennium Broadway Hotel was exceptional with this i had a wonderful time. I will be ensuring a great review on Trip Advisor for this hotel. I would suggest to anyone visiting the hotel if you have any issues to raise them straight away as this hotel will ensure to make it the best vacation they can,1
Ice cooler broken on floor| and no fridge in room.,1
Over all the property was great and in a great location to everything on Times Square.  When we first arrived and was given a room| our room had not been cleaned. Bed was left as if someone had just gotten out of it| bathroom had towels in the floor| and the room in general was in shambles.  We were given a new room and it was clean.  Out of the 4 days we were there| two elevators were not running| or had problems.  This made it extremely difficult to get to our destinations.  We purposely got up an our earlier on our departure date to make sure we could get down the elevators.  Which then had us at the airport 3 hours before our flight.  It would be hard for me to recommend your hotel.  I also felt like the concierge was very rude| he didn't seem to want to be bothered.  Your front desk people were great| and your door men| were always polite. I guess| I just expected more from your hotel.  Plus| I didn't like that you charged me extra per day to stay.  You all made up for the day| that you said I was getting free for booking online through Expedia.  That is a rip off!,1
Everything was good but some of the  elevators did not work was about 30/40 minutes waiting time,1
No fridge/ no microwave/ no free breakfast but we'll still come back WooHoo,1
Elevators were slow and packed. No fridge in the room. No clock radio in the room. No coffee machine in the room. Mattress was hard and uncomfortable and pillows were flat. Glasses in the bathroom were not wrapped in the sanitary plastic.,0
The location of the property is in a prime spot. It's easily accessible to so many things.,1
The elevator fiasco that we experienced was horrible. There were only 2 elevators working and the waits were upwards to 30 minutes or more. They didn't even bother to help address the situation. We were travelling with my 3 year old daughter and with her stroller. From flight 30 we had to go all the way down on the stairs. And the checkout informed us that we can leave our bags at the hotel the last day. They inform us to talk to a certain employee. As I went up to him| he shrugged me off and said leave the bags by the door while he walked away. Later| he would then try to scold us saying never to do that and then lied when I told him I was following his instructions.,0
I was on the top floor where it was private| and| quiet.  Excellent views.  Excellent service from staff.,1
Close to Times Square| subway and good restaurants.No coffee maker in room but Starbucks just outside 45 th St entrance.,1
Big problem with elevators! They take too longüôÅ You could be waiting 20-30 min. Staff is friendly,1
Location to times square.  Clise to restautants and broadway shows.,1
Location was excellent. Doormen and concierge staff were very helpful. There are no basic amenities that most hotels would have (coffee maker| water in lounge| ...). Service charge per day seems excessive when there really are zero extra services. Cot per day is an extra $50 ($49.00) - double what most hotels charge. They added an extra $60 onto the standard $250 credit card hold stating that the cot in the room brought up the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù of the room. Watch all the ‚Äúextra‚Äù charges or pending on your credit card. I have travelled all over the world and have never experienced this. Elevators very slow.,0
The Millennium Times Square is always our go-to because the staff goes way out of their way to ensure we are happy. The location to everthing we love in NYC is also key| but Millennium employees like Ruben Gonzales at the front desk have branded us as happy| loyal| repeat customers.,1
Very nice place in a great location easy walk to time square. The staff was very professional and friendly.,1
It's right in time square. I did not like that our bathroom kept a bad smell even after maintenance and house keeping serviced our bathroom.,1
The staff was very nice and helpful.  Hotel room was very clean.  However| the hotel is extremely outdated| the furniture in the room was very old.  The bathtub drain did not have the stop| there was a hole.  The water took forever to drain.  The bathtub floor (were you stand)| was peeling| toilet was old.  The worse thing was the beds.  They were so hard| you literally bounced| and the pillow were flat| hard and overused.  I found out when I complained| that the beds had been changed on the 40th floor.  I have a feeling they save the best rooms for direct clients| not third party guests like Expedia| Hotels.com| etc.  we moved to another hotel in Midtown.,0
The location is worth all the money| just next to Times Square.,1
Location is great| very close to everything. Lots of nice| friendly Irish Pubs. Great for people-watching.  Our room was a premium king room and was a good size with a great view from the 47th floor. The bathroom was large| but had dated showerhead and the drain was very slow. All-in-all we enjoyed our stay and wouldn't mind returning. Thank you Millennium Times Square for a very pleasant stay. üòä,1
No pool or hot tub possibly could add to rooftopOther than this all good,1
Our room was clean and quiet. The hotel is thirty second walk from Times Square. We went to three different shows and the Millennium was 5 minute walk tothem.,1
Location was great.  On the down side our first room had virtually no water pressure to the point that the toilet barely flushed. The second room was better.  The ice machine on our floor was not working the entire week we were there. The rooms advertised a fridge which was never provided,1
Close to theater|  shopping and other attractions..  Staff was pleasant,1
Dark| dirty| smelly and rude.  Horrible experience at a dated and nasty hotel.,0
Location was great. Checking in at 7 pm on Saturday and there were three people online with only one person working| so that took some time- especially since others in front of me had issues with their reservations.,1
Great location and upscale facility. All staffs are  Friendly respect,1
Location was amazing. The paintings in the lobby were beautiful,1
Location and staff were great! The front desk staff was very helpful and let us check in 4 hours early! The only thing I would say for families with children is that we noticed a slight change in  the atmosphere in Times Square as the weekend got closer. We felt totally comfortable Monday-Wednesday. Thursday night was a different story. Just be mindful of that when booking.,1
Location| location| location. If you want to be in the heart of NY| this is the place to go! This was our first trip to the city and it was great being able to get anywhere quickly. My only complaint really was the cleanliness of the windows. Sounds like a strange complaint| but when you pay for a room with a view and that view is quite obscured by dirty windows| it's a (very small) let down. Otherwise| great hotel.,1
Fantastic central location to all things in Manhattan!,1
"Bathroom door closed automatically and there was no way to keep it open.  Bathroom smelled a little musty because of this.  I was surprised that they charged a ""facilities fee"" of $29 upon check-in - I perhaps didn't read the fine print of the expedia reservation| but was surprised by the additional cost. Great location for our one night stay to see a show.",1
Lobby staff is great. Rooms are small but adequate considering you spend very little time in your room while in NYC. Location is perfect.,1
Overall good experience!,1
The only issue I have were the drapes were somewhat broken and I couldn't get them to close all the way.,1
Great location for Times Square. Good size rooms and a freindly atmosphere.,1
This is our 4th time to visit the property and the first time we were disappointed. The staff was easily overwhelmed at check in| the concierge desk signed us up for the wrong dates for car service that we had to fix and no bill was put under our door on the morning of checkout. When we went to the front desk to get a copy| they took quite some time and didn't seem concerned. Like I said| we have stayed there multiple times with great experiences but the staff seemed to be new and unaware of what to do.,0
The hotel is conveniently located in the heart of Times Square.   The beautiful Hudson Theatre is located inside of the hotel and Times Square is just around the corner.  If you want a nice| comfortable| safe| beautiful hotel for your visit before a Broadway show| I highly recommend the Millennium,1
The staff was exceptional| and property location was excellent.  One step away from Times Square.,1
Hotel staff was very helpful and courteous. Interesting menu at the restaurant,1
This hotel is all about the location|  you just can't beat it. I do wish they had mini fridges| but again its all about the location.,1
Rooms were a good size| very clean. Staff was great!! We really enjoyed our stay. Only the thing that would have been nice is coffee maker and mini fridge. Other rooms may have had this but ours did not. We would definitely recommend though and stay again!,1
The location is perfect.  The Time Square view was less pleasing than other hotels.  The resort fee for facility use is exorbitant.  The staff was very helpful.,1
I had to call on two separate days just to get toilet tissue for the room.  Good location at Times Square| but I would stay somewhere else.,0
The Millenium| which we have gone for many years| has decreased their amenities. No room service| no coffee pot in room.  It has become just a room with small pillows and a bed that is not at all comfortable. The price paid was too high for just a below average room,0
"They charged me $145 for ""extra taxes"" which is ok but I paid it when I check out and then they charged my card for another $145 and now I have to try to dispute it. Its just a hassel and I don't like to have to deal with hassels after a vacation.",0
Great location near Times Square. Room was big by NYC standards. We were able to check in early too.,1
The hotel was beautiful. The staff freindly and very helpful. Desk clerk at check out very accomodating and friendly. Housekeeping sent up coffee maket and supplies promptly when asked. Would recommend staying here and will be back. Very close to all interesting sites ex. Times square empite state building and shopping,1
Friendly staff. Hotel entrance is lovely. Room a little dated.,1
housekeeping staff was very nice. Lots of towels. They provided coffee service upon request.,1
Good location.  Comfortable bed.  Lobby has a strong odor.  Bathroom not clean.,1
The location was incredible. The heart of Times Square was right there and access to many of New York's landmarks were within minimal walking distance. Our complaint was the bathroom where it looked like mild on the tub| no fan| and the drainage in the tub and sink was very poor| they would pool up quickly. The staff was exceptionally pleasant| friendly and helpful.,1
It is ideally located near times square with a reasonable parking garage right opposite it. Worked out perfectly. The doormen were a great help with some great advice also.,1
The location was excellent for walking around the city. One note to any future travellers that we didn't know..| there is no coffee machine in the room but if you ask you can have one... not sure about other items but that would have been great to know. There also is not a fridge in the room which would have been nice since buying a bottle of water on the street was 5 dollars US.,1
No valet parking| no in-room dining| hotel rooms are a  bit warn| remote control on TV didn't work.Looking to make son's 12th birthday experience memorable| hotel underwhelmed.Very unfortunate| Ive stayed here before| and the hotel has deteriorated.,0
Overall| I enjoyed my stay at the Millennium. Staff were awesome & very friendly| from the front desk| to concierge| to the gentleman (bellmen) who always had nice words & great directions. However| I expected the room to have modern amenities such as usb ports & a working plug in bathroom (which I forgot to report). At times| the wait for an elevator was very long (20 min). The location was great (very close to GMA) & hope to see them again in the future.,1
Excellent location great room and breakfast...really good value for money.  Would love to return.,1
The location was very convenient. The hotel staff was very helpful. And the room was excellent!I would definitely consider staying at the hotel in the future.,1
Don't stay at this hotel! Regardless if they're upgrading| it doesn't have the amenities an average person needs: USB ports| extra outlets| small coffee pot and a working a/c unit. With four in a larger room| this hotel only had 2 outlets. Not enough!,0
Amazing location| literally 100m from times square & slap bang in the middle of Broadway. Bars & restaurants & theatres outside both doors (front 45th st & back 44th st). Virgils BBQ restaurant outside 45th St entrance is well worth a visit. Hotel room just ok though| no shower gel provided & be aware of $28 per night service charge on arrival. I wasn't !,1
Liked the locationDidn't like lack of tea/coffee making facility in room,1
Loved the location| within walking distance of so many attractions. Very helpful and friendly staff. I would definitely stay here again!,1
We loved the location and the room was a good size. Price was on the more expensive side.,1
The view of time Square was amazing.  It was close to all the action| very easy to get to the metro or to catch a play.,1
Can't ignore location - especially for a theatergoer.  Short walk to everything.Loved the quiet room.  Great breakfast buffet.,1
The Millennium Times Square is very conveniently located| it is in the heart of Times Square and within easy walking distance of many sites.  The rooms are nice| comfortable and clean.  I would have liked a coffee maker and refrigerator in the room| but those were the only items that I really missed during my stay.,1
It has a great location but the rooms can be updated.  Lamps outdated without charging ports.  The beds weren't that comfortable| the blankets were very thin. The bathtub tiles were dirty.  The bathroom didn't have extractor. Simple Things that can be updated for the price that the people pay for the hotel.,1
Great location.  A block from Time Square. Many restaurants around it. Desks helpful with information. You can walk to many attractions. Wonderful staff. Had a great experience.  Would use this hotel again. Within walking distance to many Broadway shows.,1
It looked like our room was not cleaned. The bed was rumpled like some one was sleeping on it. There were no towels.,1
excellent location in the center of theater district,1
I love the 2 entrances (44th & 45th) and security during night hours. Great location! Incredible view!,1
Great location. Good value. Lovely big bedroom & bathroom. High floor with open view.Would have liked my room to have tea & coffee making facilities.,1
Excellent location| good view| quiet| and we were able to check in early (10am) after our red-eye flight!,1
Overall this hotel is below average. I rated 2.5 star| not 4| especially the room. Even with the upgrade after I compliant about the room. Still not good enough. The bathroom need a major upgrade and update. The bed sheet and comforter is old. The towels is old. Furniture is broken. Lights not working. Room is dirty. No refrigerator in the room. No coffee in the first room. And they didn't refuse the coffee on the second room. I try to book the shuttle for my son to the airport. He told me he just about to close| and tell us go to the next hotel and book it there. That means he not close. He just too lazy to do it.  I couldn't believe I pay close to $400 a day for this. And other charges when I check out. Never stay here again. Such a bad experience. VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED. Last two times I came to New York. I pay about the same price |I got a much better room in the same area. I'm going back to intercontinental. The room is perfect.,0
Very worn ... bathroom fixtures loose| bedding lacking back support.  Lacked  charger outlets.,0
Loved the conceriace and people at theater desk.  Housekeeping was friendly and efficient.,1
Loved our room! The room was clean and big| bathroom was very nice and big also. The view of times square was gorgeous. Bed and pillows were very comfortable,1
Pictures not exactly what you get. Check out at 11am way to early and 50 per hour for later check out time.,1
The location is perfect. The gentlemen at the door are very friendly & very helpful. The housekeeping is excellent. We arrived May 13th | around 8-9 pm| the check in was really quick the lady at the desk gave us instructions where to go and which elevator to take. There's a desk near the elevators that has a sign ‚Äútheatre desk‚Äù. There are 2 guys in there| as we are walking to the elevators they did not shout but with really loud voice complete with pointing of both their arms to use the elevators on the other end. My point was I didn't appreciate the way they talked to us|as if we don't speak English.By the way I'm Asian| I have an accent| but I speak English very well. It's late and raining we're hungry so I didn't say anything to them| I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they have been telling people to use the correct elevators all day long.The room could use a coffe naker. I will definitely book Millennium hotel when we visit New York again.,1
Handy location in the heart of Manhattan .Great noise reduction.,1
the hotel was well located and the staff friendly and helpful.  however| NO room service ugh,1
Location was great for the price. The service was great| being a tourist they helped us navigate the city.,1
We had a great room with a great view of Times Square (1609) and the Ball & Clock Tower| room 1609. Everything about our stay there was fantastic from the check-in to the doormen & concierge and check-out| all the staff were fantastic. Only drawback is I wish there was a coffee maker in the room. We loved out stay there & would love to return again someday! Thank you Millennium Hotel for a fantastic visit!,1
The room was not clean| beds are hard as rock and there is no frog or coffee machine.,0
Room was extremely outdated and dirty. Sink was filthy. The bed sheets had brown stains on them and smelled very bad. Would not recommend and definitely booking elsewhere next time!!,0
Location was good. Drain system at shower to slow. Elevator nee,1
This hotel needs to be updated.  Our bathroom was in bad shape. A crack in counter. A handle missing. Paint peeling. Not worth the money.,0
Great location| excellent fitness room| good staff,1
Has not been refurbished in at least15 yrs. Massive vait for elevators.,0
The only major good thing about this hotel is the location : you can not be more central. Check in was just ok not very pleasant staffHotel is quite old.No shower gel Old bathroom,0
It is a great place to work. I was there over a two week period to get some writing done and be close to the studios. Perfect place to be.,1
This hotel was in an ideal spot but the deco is very tired and very badly scratched  with a cupboard door hanging off!Although clean overall there were certain areas around the toilet and skirtings that would have needed to be attended to. Be aware that the coffee facilities are only available if you ask for them!Certainly NOT a four star hotel!!!!!!!!,0
Fantastic location| could have benefited from tea/coffee facilities in the room,1
The location was great| a block away from Time Square. The room we got was not like the pics. We ended up in an older part I guess. The bed was extra firm. They also charge a $25 daily fee| that supposed to cover that there's a fitness and business center| but that's standard in any hotel| so watch the pricing. I felt it's a way for them to show a lesser price on line and then actually charge you more later. Overall| not bad| but will probably find a different one next trip.,1
Perfect for holidaying in NYC ...very central...near subway & lots of restaurant & Irish pubs  ...staff very helpful ...!! Awesome !!,1
Staff was unresponsive to complaint and refused to accommodate a mistake.,0
Dirty| old| but good location,0
Location was perfect for walking distance to shows. The elevators were the only negative. Long waiting times and when they did arrive they were usually full and had to wait for another. Other than that everything was great! I would definitely stay here again!,1
Outdated room with a tub that won't drain   Pillows were like 20 years old and like pancakes   But the employees that we interacted with were all very pleasant,0
This is the hotel I want to stay at when going to NYC,1
Security checked for keys before you were able to use the elevators.,1
This hotel is definitely my favorite go to in NYC.. the location is perfect. The staff is amazing the view was the best.. eish this is where I would have been last yr. When I was here for NYE. My room was fabulous. Only complaint is that room service was there at 700am every morning.. I'm an earlybird.. but if you arent.. you may not like this.,1
Dated rooms - few amenities in room. Location is good for Times Square / Broadway shows.,1
Overall| you cannot beat the location of the hotel with it being so close to Times Square| shopping| activities| and restaurants. The hotel is lacking in some amenities. There is no coffee pot in the room and no refrigerator| therefore no easy access water or pop in the room.,1
This hotel was super close to Time Square and conveniently has two entrances| which saved us having to go around the block to meet our friends. The hotel room was nice and spacious hotel staff was friendly. Would definitely recommended.,1
Great location. Helpful staff! Bed was very comfortable.,1
I liked the location Staff was very helpful all over and all the time. I had issue with the bathroom - needs exhausts and I saw a mosquito in my room on the 24th floor - which I thought was odd. Overall good stay though,1
The Hotel was ideally situated| unfortunately this is the only positive attribute I can think of regarding this Hotel.  I have stayed in numerous hotel in NYC and this has to be the worst and I certainly wouldn't recommend.  The room was in dire need of a refurbishment and basic things like bottled water and a fridge in the room were not available!,0
Very happy| everything was great except we had no cups or glasses in our room to brush teeth or take pills. Neither did our travel companions in their room. Otherwise I would have given them 5 stars,1
Everything was perfect. Perfect location (right in the heart of Time Square)| fast check-in| clean room with great view and nice staff. We thought we were having an issue with the heat| we called the front desk and they sent someone in less than a min. It turned out we werent working the thermostat property. They also approved us for a late check-out (12pm) My husband and I came there for one night snd spent the day touring the city. The only reason I didnt give 5 stars bc theres no parking but they do provide discounted parking passes to a parking lot about 3 blocks away ($40/car for 24hrs - no in/out). When you're in NY Times Square to walk around| site see snd tour the city| this palce serves its purpose - to come there and sleep comfortably:),1
I like that the hotel is in the middle of the actionI like that the hotel staff was friendly I was unhappy because i paid for a view from my window but the windows was so dirty the view was very blurryüòî,1
Overall everything was ok no enough time to add longer comment,1
View . Close to all large room for new york . Nice| staff helpful,1
Only  a $50 refund was credit back to me as a courtesy due to the inconvenience....only $50.,0
Fantastic location clean and friendly service will go back to the property again next year if the prices are right,1
Nice hotel| so close to the Times Square but very quiet and nice rooms... We loved this hotel.,1
Liked location. Room was a good size. Liked my view,1
At check in we weren't told about the ‚Äúresort fee‚Äù of $29 per night which means we get to use the hotel's facilities despite already paying the room rate! The lifts are terrible-expect to wait about 20 minutes to leave the hotel. The communal areas and rooms are a bit tired and needs a refresh.,0
The location is perfect| the staff is very friendly and helpful| and the beds are so comfortable.,1
I stayed at the Millennium Times square hotel for 2 days 4/9 - 4/10 2019 first night was fine. The second night I didn't notice I didn't have a comforter until I went to lay down after 11pm I called down stairs a few times| an 1hr. later went down to the front desk.  About 1/2 hr. later I received a very thin blanket| I was done for the night!  In the morning I brought this up and asked to speak to a manager| this became the first problem.  This escalted and escalated further an further (because they treated me so poorly and as if I were ignorant) I was treated very rudely and told I was trying to get something or free.  I was not on vacation I was there for work.  I'm trying to keep this short in hopes it will reach someone who is willing to read it and cares.  Long story short! Then they came to the point of threatening me with calling the police. Oh yeah| I'm a 6'4'' 300lb. Black man!  I told them to go ahead and call the police if they wish I was not finished conducting my business here at the hotel and not leaving until I was.  The police came and were very nice and understanding and didn't want to arrest me but had to side with the hotel if they said I had to leave now!  All of this over a comforter....  By the way I'm one of the owners of the newest Marriott Autograph hotel- the Historic Cavalier Hotel in Virginia Beach Va. and Embassy suites and Marriott Vacation properties under construction on the ocean front. I've never written anything like this before.,0
could not get extra pillows and blankets despite several calls to housekeeping.  No coffee in the room and we were told to park in the wrong garage.,0
Very good location for Broadway. Staff friendly and helpful. Lamps and room furnishings a little shabby| but basically ok.,1
Location was fantastic. Hotel room was outdated and need refurbishing.,1
Location and price was wonderful. The staff bent over backwards to help us. I will definitely stay there again!,1
Location was the only great value of this hotel. The rooms are old and out dated. The staff are not friendly or helpful. My initial room was dirty and noisy so they changed my room which helped. I was promised free water bottles and extra toiletries and I never received them. I didn't bother chase them. I did get two free breakfast vouchers but overall I won't be returning to this hotel in the future. The pictures on your web site of the rooms are INCORRECT. The rooms look nice and new but in reality the furniture is old| damaged and out dated.,0
Location was amazing| hotel was clean and staff were very friendly. There was a lack of plug sockets to use in a room sleeping 4 adults.,1
The hotel was in a fabulous location and the rooms were nice and quiet after a busy day in the city.Yes| the rooms are a little dated but are clean and the staff work hard to maintain.We would stay here again.,1
Nice price considering the location. I had a great view from my room,1
It was very quiet| as we like it| excellent location and we had a view| so can't really complain. Rooms need a bit of updating but that is pretty much the norm nowadays.,1
Staff are excellent| bistro has good food.  Rooms bathroom needs a good grout cleaning but was accommodating.,1
Rooms are a bit dated| no tea or coffee in room. No fridge in room| not happy being charged an extra 28 dollars a night for facilities we never used nor wanted to use. however staff were friendly and the location is ideal,1
The location was great.  No bar or casual dining in the hotel.  There was not a refrigerator in the room which was disappointing as we wanted our own beverages.,1
Adequate for my situation.,1
The location is worth the few things we missed. The room we had didn't have a mini-fridge/mini-bar.  This was no big deal to be but was upsetting to my husband (saved us money though!).  They also don't have room service but we used UberEats and so that too was no big deal. I mean| location| location| location. The room was much larger than most NYC hotel rooms and the TV steams Netflix| Hulu and more!!! I could even play my music from my phone through the TV! I highly recommend for those on a budget but don't want to feel like it.,1
I have stayed at this hotel a couple times. This was my 3rd time and while the location is perfect| my room however had a few issues. The bed was cozy but the bed sheets had spots on them. There were marks all over the walls and the bathroom outlet was broken. Also on Expedia it said I would have a room with a view| which I did not have.,1
No coffee machines in the rooms. No makeup mirrors in the bathrooms. The pillows were hard and the quilt was worn out. The carpet in the halls need to be cleaned.,1
Consierge was very helpful! Doorman was so nice and welcoming!,1
Property is at good location but the rooms are really outdated.we were charged facility fee for $86 dollars which we did not even use one day.the air condition system is horrible you cannot change the temp setting it got very hot in the room we called the operator the engineer came to inspect and told us the setting are fixed but if it was hot then we can open the windows!!!! Do you a favor and find somewhere else to stay.,0
Friendly staff  clean will kept  great location on time square,1
Hotel is at Times Square and thus central to night activities| broadway shows| shopping| restaurants.,1
the property was perfectly situated half a block from time square and across the street from Good Morning America,1
Great location but that's about it.  No AC| no refrigerator in room.  After 3 requests we did get a tiny fridge.  Bed was hard and room was hot.  Elevators were slow and you need to build in 15 minutes to get down to the lobby.  Terrible view of tops of buildings next door from our room at least.,0
Perfect location| great buffet breakfast. Very friendly| helpful staff. Would not hesitate to go back and stay there again.,1
Loved the proximity to Times Square!  Didn't realize there isn't any air conditioning during the winter months...only heat!  The room was pretty warm.  We ended up ordering fans from Amazon...had them delivered to the hotel...and all was well!,1
The property was convenient for seeing Broadway shows.   There were so many restaurants in the vicinit| all of which within walking distance from the hotel.,1
great location| staff and LOCATION!  wish it was a little cleaner and better maintained !,1
Perfect location for exploring all the New York has to offer. Staff were friendly and helpful.,1
Good hotel and great location. Awesome city views from the top. Hotel is a bit dated. Furniture and bathroom a bit old but still good.,1
Enjoyed the hotel| great location| BUT| at check out cost higher than Hotels.com stated on my confirmation the ‚Äúamount that I would owe at the hotel‚Äù| Hotels.com had in BOLD lettering amount I would owe| leading me to believe that was the total| when| in fact| it was not.  Pleased with the hotel but not with hotels.com,1
Our room was clean and comfortable.  Our complaints about a cycling toilet and broken light switch were addressed within 1/2 hour by maintenance.  The Concierge graciously copied some documents for us.  We wish the room was a little larger| and there was no extra facilities fee.,1
Beautiful and convenient.  Comfortable beds. Great location.,1
Convenience and location were perfection and easy to get to restaurants and shows,1
the room that i saw here itsnt the one that i receive when i arrived there so you guys have to tell the true to the customer if not they are not going to choose you as part of the vacation plans to book something in the future.,1
Have always liked this property for it's good size rooms| location| gym and excellent room service. The rooms are still nice but need a little maintenance and care. Room service was down when I was there| but the manager apologized and offered breakfast vouchers which was nice. Overall it's still s lovely hotel.,1
The bathroom was terrible. Cabinets were broken. Overly busy. Had to wait over 20 mins for an elevator!!! Will not stay here again. Location is the only good thing.,0
It's close to multiple subway lines - so it's easy to get anywhere in NYC!,1
This hotel had a rating of very good. I would rate this hotel below good. The hotel rooms need updated. Our bathroom fan didn't work. When you showered you open the door to let the steam out . The door wouldn't stay open unless you wedged it by the toilet. When you showered the drain was slow so the tub filled as you showered. There was black mold in the tile grout. The dresser was broken| side tables were scratched. The bedding was worn out and needed to be replaced. The staff was not present and seemed unaware that they had people staying at the hotel.,0
More expensive than Expedia tells you - old hotel| room not clean| drapes falling down off the windows.,0
Good thing about property it's close to everything near Broadway and Times Square. What I didn't like:  When they standard room they mean Standard!  Hardest bed ever! If your hot natured you can't turn the heat down just off...and open a window is your choice. No coffee maker you have to ask for it. No fridge| no pens| paper| no menu| no info about the hotel services in room...nothing special. Like a no name hotel in the middle of no where.  Breakfast is better at Hard Rock for price and what you get. I don't know what the premier rooms are like but I hope they are 10xs better!,0
The hotel is a shadow of itself.  Horrible.  I stayed at this hotel 5 years ago.  It was perfect.  There's now a nail in the bed head.,0
There was bugs in our bathroom. When we asked to move as this was unacceptable to us they had oversold the rooms and had no rooms available that they could move us to. They would not help us find or secure another hotel for the night. We spent an hour and half talking to the front desk and phoning all over the city on our own to try and find another room but there was nothing we could find for a Saturday night. They would not help us find another room or pay the difference for a room with now short notice so all the prices were higher. Our male friends said they would switch rooms with us for the night until we could secure a room somewhere else the next night. We had to move all our own lugggage between the rooms. Then we asked that they put on clean sheets for us due to the switch. We came back in the late evening/early morning to find a bag of sheets on the floor outside of our room!!!!!!!! They once again said they have no maids. All of the staff there were completely unsympathetic and beyond frustrating to deal with. I was told that we would be credited for the two nights and I still have not seen a credit to my account from nearly a week and a half ago. I would not recommend this hotel service to anyone!!! Worst experience ever and I have stayed in my share of hotels.,0
I had a pleasant stay. Room was clean and wake-up call was on time,1
Convenient location - in the middle of everything.  Close to the theaters.  Didn't feel clean and the bed spreads were paper thin so I was freezing all night even with the heat cranked.  The bed was hard and uncomfortable.,1
Everyone from the doorman to bell to front desk| breakfast place  and housekeeping were helpful and very nice.,1
The staff are overly friendly and hospitable. Everything was great. The only thing I wished I had was a coffee maker in the room but there is a Starbucks right outside of the 5th street entrance which ended up being fine. View was great from the 26th floor!,1
Location is excellent. Staff very helpful too. Very enjoyable stay.,1
It was literally right on broadway so everything was right within walking distance. Didn't have to Uber anywhere.,1
Nice room. Friendly helpful staff. Great location too,1
The staff at check in was helpful and friendly. We were disappointed in the cleaniness of the room. It was rather outdated and there were blood stains on the sheets. At checkout we notified the staff at the desk of our concerns about cleanliness and he said he would notify housekeeping.,0
Great location!! Super staff and stunning views of Times Square.,1
The staff very friendly and courteous. The rooms were very old and outdated.  But the location is great. We look at the hotel as a place to just sleep - and that's what i would say about this hotel. It was perfect to just sleep there. No frills.,1
Very friendly staff fantastic location I would recommend and return,1
From the start of my 4 night stay every staff member provided Exceptional service with a smile or friendly greeting. I will stay here again!!!,1
Staff friendly| professional and helpful thanks....................,1
Location is brilliant| decor internally needs a little TLC,1
The location of this property is ideal for visiting all of the main attractions.,1
We had a comfortable corner room with lots of windows and a city view.  Quiet too.,1
The property was convenient to Time Square| Central Park| Broadway and points of interest.  The view from my window was phenomenal!! The staff was extremely helpful and friendly!,1
Perfect location and great staff. Elevators are a little odd| but gets you to and from your room lol,1
Great location. Knowledgeable and friendly staff. Very easy to get to all of the major attractions and lots of food options around Time Square. We definitely would stay here again.,1
Perfect greeting! Room was ready early and in a great location. Our second stay and plan to stay there again!,1
Rooms were not as nice as expected for a Times Square hotel.,1
Staff was friendly and welcoming. The room was nice my favorite was the bathroom. We had a beautiful view from the 36th floor!,1
I hope everyone stays here ! Best hotel in Newyork,1
The position close to Times Square| although sometimes it was noisy on a night time.I was very disappointed in the room and the attitude of one member of staff. Although clean | little thought on the quilt which was a sheet| cold on a night| no toiletries left| no coffee or tea|  one day no towels|no support from the staff on duty. I mentioned to check in staff tthat we had no no towels I was told no towels in reception  on the desk ring housekeeping.I wrote a complaint letter to the manager received no response.,0
My price was very good.  I stayed there 2x before many years ago.  The rooms now really need refreshing.  It was clean and I liked the location.  Zero wow factor.,1
Location was great| spacious room and comfy bed| bar and restaurant was small but friendly staff,1
Excellent location to Times Square. Rooms were nice. Staff was helpful and friendly. My only compliant was the restaurant is off the front door and cold when people come and go.,1
Loved the location. Many of options around.   Short walks to everything.,1
The hotel was clean. The Staff was very helpful. Access to the bathroom in the lobby required a room card| but the desk gave us one after we'd checked out. The bellman held our bags until the evening| which was great.,1
Over all our three day stay was enjoyable...Service| dining| room all very good.  Thanks.,1
Extremely slow check in. Huge line of five people. Plenty of workers available but on break. Almost 1 hour check in process,0
"I am absolutely against the added ""facility"" fee of  $28.69 which people at the front desk explained goes straight into the pockets of the owners in China and had not been charged previously in any of our stays. This charge has NO basis for existence other than to make the owners richer. It isn't the amount but the principle involved.  Dr. Richard Carella",1
We were disappointed that our room did not have a refrigerator| nor a coffee pot.,1
Location service property manager Gvvxxxxxcvhb. Cxcc,1
Very clean and staffs were very friendly and accommodating. Prime area| close to everything.,1
really disappointed with the poor service and response to my complaint| I didn't get the room that I had booked and paid  for| rooms were still not ready 2 hours after check in time| very poor response from the staff to my complaint. I have called and emailed several time since| got no response. I would not stay here again. The hotel told me that Hotels/com make up the info on the rooms that don't exist.,0
Great experience had a great time comfortable venue,1
No room service and no notification that they would not have that resolved until March. We didn't know until we called at 7am for coffee. Had to go outside in the 8 degree weather to get coffee!!,0
Excellent location. Times Square is literally at your doorstep. We stayed on the 51st floor with a great view. Elevators were fast.,1
Perfect location for seeing evening shows. Very friendly staff| great value for price.,1
Very clean room and although it's on a very busy street the room was quiet.,1
Location was ideal and parking right across the street,1
The hotel is in a great location. So easy to get places and surrounded by some great restaurants. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. My only disappointment was it rates its self as a four star hotel| but the amenities in the room are definitely only 2 or 3 star standards.,1
Went to NYC with my daughter for her birthday. Had a wonderful time. Location was great| and staff were pleasant.Wished I had coffee maker and small fridge. (Did get a call from manager to appease| but I was leaving the next day and didn't want to bother)I had also requested a high floor with good view| but was told that's the ‚Äútype‚Äù of room I paid for. Made it seem like I couldn't even upgrade.Will be going back to NYC with family and friends| but I think I will call the hotel manager directly and request these things over the phone prior to my trip.,1
It was an amazing experience. Even though it was for just one night we could see the excellence of this hotel. The location was amazing| just a short walk from Times Square| the room was very clean and organized| the shower was really nice| the view is amazing| Mr. Syed from the reception was very kind and gave us an amazing first impression| the other receptionist was very very kind| too bad I didn't get her name and the luggage men were very kind too! I can't honestly say it was the best hotel I've stayed and I'm looking foward to coming back!,1
Elevators were slow.,1
Amazing! Great Location! Awesome service! Celebrities staying at our hotel| Very safe area! Could not have asked for more.,1
Hotel was close to Times Square| Rockafeller| 5th Ave| subway and a lot of tourist sites. Clean| friendly service. This is our new hotel when we travel to New York.,1
location was excellent clean and convenient to times square,1
The only positive to this hotel is the location. We picked this hotel based on it being a 4 star - it's not. It's in bad need of a renovation| it's tired| there obviously used to be a mini bar/fridge but they decided to rip it out. We were provided with an ice bucket and a kettle| but no glasses| cups or coffee/tea making facilities. Our bed sheets had holes in them| the windows were filthy| and the light bulbs had layers of dust on them. Not a hotel that I can recommend I'm afraid and I would advise anyone thinking of booking to look elsewhere.,0
One area of note - prepare to wait on the elevators ‚Äî they were very difficult if you were staying on a higher level floor| trying to catch one many times waited 10+ minutes| or had to take stairs from 42nd floor.,1
Thomas the concierge provided information to us for dining and theater| walking distance| made reservations as if he was my personal concierge.  I love being taken care of,1
Location  is good for theater. Appreciated early check-in. Elevators a bit slow.,1
The room had an awesome view and the beds were comfy| if only a little small,1
Great location convenient to subway as well as times square.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  Would definitely stay here again.,1
One of new yorks finest,1
My fiance did a night in the city to take in a show. The staff was very friendly. I had called earlier and they accommodated my early check in as well as my request for a city view on a higher floor. The room was very clean and comfortable. You could see there was some wear though in terms of the curtain rods| the fan getting stuck in the bathroom| cracks in the bathroom floor. None of these things affected my stay but they were aesthetically displeasing and they are pretty simple fixes.  Overall I recommend the Millennium Broadway.,1
Good location to Times Square and theaters . Great restaurants and shopping all in walking distance,1
The staff was exceptionally friendly. There was no lounge area in the lobby and no coffee available in the room or lobby. It cost me $13.50 for two coffees in the restaurant.,1
The location was the best aspect of the property. The bathroom could be cleaner| and the room was either humid or too dry. The staff were very nice| though! I overall enjoyed my stay. Never had the breakfast| so can't comment on that. Also no fridge in guest rooms which bummed me out a little.,1
Check in was smooth however the resort fee (for 3 nights - $80) seemed like a last minute cash grab by the hotel although all the hotels in Times Square had this fee it made no sense.The hotel is dated. we were in room 3003 on the 30th floor and our view of Times Square wasn't the best. Location was great we were in walking distance of everything. The restaurant in the hotel was Singaporean so not really even on our radar. Beware.. the gift shop in the lobby overcharges. There is a Walgreens 2 minutes awayThe room was sub-par. In the restroom above the toilet there were brown spots and pubic hairs. They only give 2 hand towels and a bunch of other towels also. The tile and tube need a GOOD cleaning.The mattress was HARD and the comforter was paper thin. I had to ask for 2 extra comforters. The headboard was missing emblems and the furniture was very worn and scuffed.I believe there are several things they could improve upon but they should be realistic about the views and the quality of the rooms. I was disappointed in my choice but the location made up for it. Suggestion: spend the extra money and get a nicer hotel!,0
The hotel was centrally located| which was nice. The elevators are so noisy we could not sleep. All night all we heard we're the elevators,0
Stay was great| people were really nice and accommodating but bathroom was a little dated with some rust on the faucet etc.  Also| the curtain didn't open all of the way to reveal the NY skyline we were looking for.  Overall though a great experience..,1
The location was perfect. Walking distance to everything iconic in NYC. We went to see a broadway play and only walked 2 blocks from hotel. Rockefeller plaza only a 10 minute walk. For the price you can't beat this hotel. Spacious rooms but could use a little updating. We will stay here again.,1
great location|| if you want to be in the heart of broadway.. and a good price here you go,1
Stayed over New Years. Staff were very accommodating| room was clean   Had a great time,1
Very noisy location. Staff fairly unfriendly. Breakfast is two-tiered system If rate included is not as good as paying on day from a menu. Lifts very noisy if your room is next to the lift shaft which ours was| for SEVEN nights.,0
The room was very warm even with the heat turned off.  This was especially noticeable when trying to fall asleep.  As my stay was in December there was no chance of turning on the AC to cool the room down.,1
Issues with fridge were resolved quickly. Everything else great.,1
Carpet was warren and had some stains  could not turn down the heat very warm,1
The only thing was that the room wasn't ready. Otherwise it is a great experience.,1
Hotel is in a great location for tourists. Room was a bit tired and in need of redecoration and our room was above a generator so pretty noisy day and night.Room very clean and cleaner always made sure we had ample clean towels and toiletries even on Christmas Day. We weren't aware we had to pay a facility tax which added another $145 US to our bill at check out. We accept this is often the way in the US and is contained in the small print. We did however find the explanation given to us by a male receptionist unprofessional when he told us the money ‚Äúwas for the boss‚Äù (what he literally said) which implied something less than above board. He thought this explanation was amusing which we didn't find funny after a very expensive 5 days in NY.We much preferred the Millenium Biltmore in LA. That is a beautiful hotel.,1
The only thing i liked was that it was a warm place to sleep in the cold City of New York. I didnt like the 4 star hotel price I paid for what looked like a 1 or 2 star hotel.... Pictures should be attached. Dirty tubes| wallpaper peeling| small rooms! I paid for city view and got side of buildings view...just overall disappointing. Would NEVER go back!,0
Nice older hotel. Very convenient to all Times Square sites and activities. Staff very accommodating. Because of the busy location| I would recommend a room on a higher floor to reduce the noise. Would definitely stay here again.,1
Nice hotel very close to Broadway street and a centralized to all attractions.  Staff was very helpful with anything we needed.,1
Beautiful hotel and great location. Staff were great and very helpful. Room was beautiful but no mini fridge or glasses.,1
Needs more staff & physical refurbishing.  Inadequate breakfast buffet,1
location location location....EXCELLENT!  This hotel is in the HEART of manhattan.  walkable to everywhere!,1
Loved it! Especially the doorman David he made this whole experience worthwhile,1
Overall concern and respect for guests. There was prompt follow-up when a problem occurred.,1
Very nice hotel in a great location!  The staff are all very professional and do a fantastic job.,1
I loved the location. Our Bellman Kevin was outstanding| as was all the staff. The rooms were clean and ready. We checked in 1/2 hr early with no questions. The only complaint would be the heat. It's too hot. Staying there in December the system only does heat in cold months and cool in warm months. Our window did not open so it got pretty warm in the room. That was not so fun. But let's be honest. The room was neat and clean. The staff and food was great. How much time do you intend on spending in your room in the middle of Times Square? I was there to sleep and eat breakfast. Other than that| I never seen the place. I would definitely stay again.,1
Millenium hotel is the best location in the city; near Bryant Park and Broadway!! We have stayed here many times| but it's been a few years... The Hotel is in need of some updates in the guestrooms| and a better cleaning system. The headboards had so much dust on them and the furniture is worn a bit.,1
The man at the concierge desk was wonderful with helping us with dinner plans.  The rest of the hotel had a lot to be desired.  I could never receive the proper towels. Had no wash clothes during our stay and when asked they would say they were out of them????  The sheets and bed coverings looked as if they used them to clean.  This hotel needs a desperate upgrading on furniture and amenities.  Great location is all it has.,0
Excellent hotel. Attentive staff and beautiful decor. Looking forward to staying there in the future.,1
Great location- cleanliness... nice staff!Subway stops are very close... great restaurants a short walk away!,1
Nice hotel in a nice location.  Could certainly use a bathroom fan,1
The man at the front desk was extremely rude when we checked out. I informed him that our window on the 31st floor was broken and water was leaking in from the outside of the building and that I was mad because we payed extra for a room with a view of Times Square. The window also had iced over in between the panels of glass making it impossible to see out the window. The other winless were fine except this one. I asked if there was any way to be refunded the extra money due to the inconvenience in our room and he just gave attitude and started making it seem like it was my fault and that I was in the wrong. I asked for a manager and he said no. Horrible staff extremely rude and inconsiderate. Will never go to this hotel again.,0
Best location you could have for Times Square| Rockefeller Center and Grand Central.,1
Dining room was smaller than most| but food was good. Disliked getting-up in morning and going across street for coffee.Room was large| bed good| maid excellent.Would return.,1
Needs total renovation| had peeling paint and furniture is all scratched up. The only nice thing was the marble in the lobby.,0
This is in no way shape or form a 4 star hotel.  Please do not expect that!  The hotel is dirty.  Old| outdated.  Furniture is beat up like crazy and not comfortable at all. Mold in the bathroom.  Used soap bar left in the shower.  Half the staff was great| the other half was beyond rude. Even complained about this and was told we would be contacted- and we still have not been contacted.  Please stay elsewhere!,0
Great hotel.   So close to Time Square. Irish pubs right outside the front door.,1
Great central location| overall pretty good. Room starting to look tired and in afew occasions we had to wait upto 15 mins for the lift.,1
Lovely hotel| perfect location and friendly staff.We will definitely return when we're next in NY and would very happily recommend this hotel to anyone.,1
No coffee in the room but otherwise it was fine llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll,1
The location was excellent!  It was central to several things to do.  Rooms were also nice and quiet.,1
Not what I expected at all. I got the time square room| which means i should be able to view time square. That wasn't the case. The room was so outdated and most of the appliances didnt work. They didnt have a coffee pot set up in my room| meanwhile I can smell it brewing in other rooms. If you are in a rush so be it Haha. Six elevators and they only run one going down. My wife and I waited nearly 22 min (no exaggeration) and almost missed our broadway show. Only positive thing about this place is location.,0
Staff was great| checkin went smoothe and we were uprgraded to a suite...sweet!. Rooms need some updating..view was amazing 51st floor overlooking the ball.,1
Good location Room outdated Bathroom sink was not properly cleaned,1
It's just pretty gross.  There is no duvet cover on the duvet. The pillows are truly flat and hard it's pretty terrible for the price.,0
Bed was hard mattress hard not soft no coffee maker in room,1
The elevators leave a LOT to be desired.  They are working on them| but you need to allow for an extra 30 minutes.  Finally a staff member operated one elevator.  Until their fixed| beware,1
First room we were given was not cleaned at all| bed unmade and bath not cleaned.  Brought to new room with hole in sheet| lamp that could not turn off - needed to unplug and not a full set of linen - only bath towels no hand towels.  Staff tried to improve stay but only gave a few extra towels.,0
It was very central to broadway. But as i travel alot it would not go in as one my best to remember.  Felt for   standard of hotel should have been ableto make a black coffeein room. Bed big but hard took me a few nights to adapt to it. Some staff  were really nice   but there were  afew not.,1
We have stayed at this hotel for years and everything was great.  This time the comforter was thread bare and was not warm enough.  The windows leaked cold air into the room.  The towels we were given were thread bare and torn.  We will look for another place to stay next year.  We wont go back,0
Staff unpleasant and unhelpful$28 a day resort charge for  facilities not requested or usedWaiting time for lifts 15 min to 1 hr,0
Excellent location. Room clean and beds comfortable,1
Room was very dark all lights had shorts and flickered only bathroom outlet worked to charge cell phones.  Not very friendly staff.,0
"We've stayed here several times.. each time| the rooms seem to deteriorate| (needing upgrade)| and the rooms are in need of a thorough cleaning. Syad| the desk clerk that checked us in| was pleasant and nice to deal with. Our room attendant Elcie| with a ""C""| was pleasant and friendly. We love the location| but would be nice if there was a hotel restaurant with American food| and more reasonably priced..",1
Location was excellent staff was very helpful n pleasant cleanliness  be improved a little,1
At a two day cost of $1000| my expectations of this hotel were quite high.  When I arrived| the main floor indicated I might have found a decent place.  Wrong!  We opened the door to our room and it looked like a poor version of a super 8.  I couldn't fit in the bathtub| there were almost no towels| the comforter was see through and the curtains couldn't block out light if you paid them.  Staff were rude| view was disappointing.  All around| not worth it!,0
Expected more based on previous stays.  No attention to room details.  Nothing extraordinary welcomimg from staff,1
Everything was super beautiful clean everyone was very helpful. Would definitely stay there again,1
The room was very dirty and dusty -bed linens were dreadful -long wait for elevators. Front desk staff for nice and friendly as were the bell hops but rooms were terrible,0
The entire stay was perfect and the ticket planner (Doreen / Maureen?) was  so great and helpful with tickets.  The Concierge was also very wiling to help when needed.  Thanks for the wonderful experience.,1
Nice hotel| conveniently located| spacious room|  and great views.,1
Disappointed by the service| room and general experience of this hotel. Location was good...it's basically what you're paying for.,0
I loved the views that we had| I did not like the constant noise of the elevators that we heard all night.,1
Great theatre desk (Maureen is a gem).  Hotel was well located| clean.  Another restaurant or coffee shop would be nice...the Asian-only option can get old after a day.,1
This is the fourth time I have stayed at the Millennium and each time is better than the last.  The hotel is in the heart of the theatre district and is convenient to everything.  My husband and I will be back again next Spring.,1
Great location and updated rooms,1
Central location. Friendly staff.,1
Rooms don't look anything like the pictures. Bed was hard as a rock.  Not the best staff running the front desk either.,0
Loved the view.  I wish there were coffee machines in the room...,1
The elevators were a mess some folks including my wife and I waited for 23 minutes for the elevator to stop for us on the 45th floor.  We called security only to no one answer and the  a second time to have the security person just hang up.  Called the manager via the operator and went to his voice mail.No very customer caring at all.  Last time there for me,0
Great location| good service| rooms and furniture outdated,1
Elevator situation is bad - waited forever for an elevator every time!  Lots of hair in the bathroom that wasn't mine when I checked in.  Lobby was great| room was comfortable and large| bed was comfortable| staff was friendly.  I would stay there again.,1
no refrigerator after I was told one would be brought up by the front desk | no computer to use,0
Convenient & close to Times Square. Friendly staff! Incredible views,1
Of course| the Times Square/Broadway location is wonderful| particularly since it gave us options to deal with the chaotic situation on the subways. The staff members at lobby desk| at concierge desk and for room cleaning were quick to meet our requests. The room was fine with adequate space| but I was surprised that there was no coffee pot or fridge. The elevators ran on a schedule that left people at the floors because of overcrowding. Over all| we do recommend the hotel and would stay there again.,1
Front desk Customer service here is terrible food here is average and expensive.,0
For a rating of 1 out of 10 i give a 3.the bar area staff where slow sitting not comfortable| also bed were very hard you need to up date.,0
GREAT HOTEL| GREAT LOCATION| GREAT STAFF!! We utilized every aspect of this hotel!! The concierge| the room service| etc!! Everyone was so very helpful to my and my Grandaughters stay!! We will be coming back!!,1
Very clean|  everyone was nice and helpful. Loved how close it was to everting.,1
Very close to everything! Was a little run down. Staff was nice and helpful.,1
Nice room friendly staff good location easy to find.,1
Hotel is very central to all tourist attractions and eating and drinking places too,1
Very convenient for Times square and Broadway. The hotel has a great look (art deco?)There is a deli and an Irish pub situated across the road.I would recommend it to anyone,1
The room didnt meet our expectations| unfortunately our room was not made up.The shower has very little power and only body wash and conditioner is given as complementaries,0
Hotel location is right on Times Square which is great but room photos the hotel shows are nothing like actual rooms. Rooms were dirty| felt dirty and we were very disappointed. First night we got there we found vodka bottle and other opened drinks in room. Front desk was helpful and changed our room but again the rooms our outdated and dirty. It is rated 4 stars but I would give it a 3 because of great location and staff,0
Wonderful location and pleasant staff Easy check in and also easy checkout,1
Good location. Amazing Breakfast. Big & comfy rooms.,1
Location was awesome!  Hotel restaurant was also very good.,1
It was extremely convenient to the theatre and had a Starbucks right across the street.,1
Great location great breakfast but it is very tired and old looking I was disappointed with the room it definitely needs a refurb but you can't beat it for location.,1
The room was not the one we expected| the balcony had a left over stuff n it looked awful The shower was not working properly n the TV had no Channels| there was no mini fridge nor an Iron| though it had ironing board| We asked ice to be delivered in our room| it didn't arrive Though we checked 4 hrs later| according to arrive time| Really not happy with the service,0
The location of shopping and time square was awesome but the hotel is outdated and dark and dull in the rooms for $500 a night it's over priced and the curtains haven't been washed in 3-4 years it's dusty should be called motel-8,0
The location is good.  But the elevators were under repair.   We were on the 32nd floor and we waited sometimes over 15 min for an elevator.  The entire hotel needs some TLC.  Not impressed with the condition of the rooms or the lobby or the bathroom.  Won't stay there again.,0
Mattress was too firm for our taste. Disappointed there wasn't a coffeemaker.,1
The hotel rooms could do with a refresh| but the beds are comfy and the room was very clean. The food in the restaurant was good and breakfast was really tasty and set us up well for a day of exploring. The hotels best asset is it's staff all of whom are friendly| helpful and knowledgable. This was a great base for exploring and made the best of our time in NYC. Would definitely recommend.,1
Beds are uncomfortable. Everything else was great.Check in was easy. Only 1 elevator working friday morning,1
The room was dirty and curtains was filthy the bathroom smelled like pee and the heat barely worked took like 5 hours to heat up the room the staff was ok but the mgrs had nonchalant attitudes like it's ok to mistreat a customer that pays $500 a night just treat them any kind of way,0
"I booked a room with a view of the ""ball drop"" (42nd street) and they put me on the other side of the hotel with a view of another building.When i called to complain| they told me a ""msnager"" would call me back.  No one ever did.",0
This was just two blocks from Times Square and the ABC News room| so super cool location. But only two of their six elevators were working.  It took 15 minutes to get an elevator some mornings!  We had to plan in elevator time as part of our travel time!,1
Hotel nice but a bit run down furniture old and broke told staff they said that they would have it fixed but they didn't,1
Nice hotel just off Broadway. Helpful staff.  Delicious in-room dining.  Close to most theaters.,1
You cannot beat the location.  Near Time Square and the shows .  Nice place,1
Great location| nice rooms| excellent staff was friendly and helpful,1
My only issue was that we had to pay $28.69 per night for resort fee (fitness center| computer access) when checking out| which we never use. We were hardly at the hotel other than to sleep. We end up $286.90 for the 10 nights.,1
Great location! Nice facility. Comfortable surroundings.,1
Perfect location| very nice and helpful staff. The views are great.,1
This hotel is in the perfect location next to times Square. Very quiet| clean| plenty toiletries| clean towels and bedding. The lifts are a bit slow in the morning and the rooms are not suitable for disabled as we found out,1
Good location to Times Square. Very accomadating to early check in. Baggage handled with care. Room sevice was especially gracious. Would consider staying again,1
For the price you cannot go wrong.  Being in Time Square was easy and the hotel was very clean.,1
THE  ROOM!!!  We loved the bigger bathroom and the shower had awesome pressure!!  Very kind and helpful staff.  Awesome location!  We will see you next October.,1
Nice hotel in a great location. Rooms are nice sized and well kept.,1
Parking garage directly across street. Oversized vehicles allowed,1
Great location for easy access to attractions and restaurants.,1
Nice hotel| great location. In walking distance to most main sites. There was a Deli opposite so great for early mornings to grab a coffee & a bagel to start the day. Times Square| Broadway| the Rockerfella Centre all a stones throw away.,1
Great location!! Close to everything in Times Square area. Not far from subway as well. One bed was comfortable and the other was as hard as a rock. Other than that| the room was nice & clean.,1
very central location.ideal for a city trip.very friendly staff.sometimes not all lifts in operation and therefore long waiting times,1
Close to Times Square. Friendly staff. But too long waiting on elevators in the morning (up to 25 min).,1
Great location at time square and close to theatresComfortable room,1
Location was great. Curtains smelled dusty. Cleanliness was mediocre.,1
Beautiful room right in Times Square. Quite spacious for Manhattan. Appreciated that the A/C was fairly quiet. Lovely experience. Needs better and more accessible outlets for phones and tablets.,1
Millennium Broadway at Times Square| your best choice !!!,1
Fabulous as always. My favorite hotel. Right in the middle of everything,1
Clean. Efficient. Good price. Great location. Will be staying here next time. Two nights in a row they forgot to leave washcloths. Called the front desk| they sent some right up. If that's the worst problem| I think that makes it a pretty fantastic trip. I'm really picky about cleanliness and attitude. Every staff member we interacted with was fast and friendly| and the room was very clean. Check and check.,1
Great hotel and centrally located! I'll definitely stay again!,1
Many years ago we stayed at the Millennium Hotel in New York City. We were so impressed with the hotel we purchased a gift card for family who were celebrating their anniversary so they could stay. We return a few years later and again were impressed. So when we were discussing a trip back to NYC for our 5th wedding anniversary we chose a hotel we thought we could count on. Sadly we were mistaken. We arrived late Friday evening checked in and were given a room with a large water stain and black mold on the ceiling. It also had leaked onto the curtain.  There were dead bugs in the light fixture outside our room and the light fixtures in the hallway were damaged and broken.  The carpets were stained and looked dirty and we heard the slamming of doors all night long. The front desk did offer to move us| but after a very late check in and a busy schedule| I didn't want to re-pack. I wanted a bottle of water and had to leave he hotel because there are no vending machines in the entire hotel.,0
The hotel is very close to Time Square| shopping and great restaurants.  The staff at the front desk and door man were wonderful.  The conceriege booked the wrong shuttle bus for me to get to the airport| so I almost missed my flight.  Highly stressful.The room we stayed at was completely filthy.  It was disgusting!  The bedding was a sheet and a blanket with no cover.  The towels were clean.  We went for 2 days without a bathmat| hand towels or face clothes....that was disappointing.  The overall room was worn out| furniture was beat up| carpet had orange stains and was dirty.  Bathroom sink and tub were dirty with grime.  Corners had buildups of dirt| dust and grime.  Light fixtures and walls had greasy grime..super disappointed with the hotel.,0
This is a perfect location.  We were able to easily walk to plays| Central Park and great restaurants.,1
Really pleased with the hotel| the only reason I would rate it a 4/5 overall is due to the rooms looking a little tired. Although they are spacious and we had a great view of the Times Square ball on the 35th floor.,1
Great location| right in the middle of Times Sq. Nice room| but Bathroom could use a renovation.,1
It was clean and very close to everything  I definitely would go back and stay,1
Place could use updating.We stayed there 17 year agp| nothing updated.,0
Right in the middle of everything!  Friendly staff and willing to help!,1
Great staff| close to everything| tickets counter gal| Jennifer was wonderful. Bathroom was a bit dated.,1
Right at Times Square.  All staff were great.  They were nice and helpful.  My family really enjoyed one of the Bell men. He gave us helpful information about the city.  He was very personable and a joy to meet.,1
Great Hotel| perfect location within minutes of Times Square| clean | helpful staff,1
Nice overall| decor a little tired away from main entrance but is close to Time Square and with being on Broadway close to shows. Good food is not far away in any direction.Public transport especially the subway very good and relatively cheap though it can be rather crowded traveling at peak times. New yorkers very helpful and friendly All the restaurants we visited served good food at fair prices for a big city like New York,1
Very disappointing. Linen was soiled. Curtains| carpets and corridors were in extremely poor and unclean condition.,0
The hotel is in the heart of downtown. Therefore the location was near many shoppping stores. It was located across from GMA. The only issue was the taxi driver not being able to find the hotel initially. However once it was located that was not an issue.,1
Friendly and accommodating staff.  Reasonably large room.  Great location!,1
3 - I had sent an email complaint to them| no one ever replied to me.,0
Clean hotel and friendly staff| right on times square..,1
"Excellent location. Walking distance to all touristic places. No breakfast is provided| nor coffee pot| microwave or fridge is in regular room.  $25 fee per day is charged on top of the $50 ""facility"" fee....staff is SUPER friendly and willing to help you with directions.",1
For the price| you're bound to be disappointed by this hotel. The rooms are due for an update (dirty| grungy bathrooms| hard beds| dirty windows| etc.).,0
It was not pleasant due to the room with a dirty odor.,0
I can not properly state how much i enjoy staying here. Everything is first rate and i will stay nowhere whenever i visit NYC,1
Very friendly and helpful staff. We asked for help on a couple of occasions and they did just that. The concierge in particular should be singled out for praise. Without him our prebooked taxi would have let us down. A few phone calls from him got it sorted.,1
We had a wonderful experience at the Millennium Broadway!  The staff was extremely helpful every time we needed something and made our stay so enjoyable!  The hotel is not new but is was a nice place to lay my head after an exhausting day of exploring the big beautiful city!  It is also a perfect location in Times Square!  You walk right out of the hotel and into the excitement of city!,1
The rooms were spacious for NY.  The rooms were very clean and the beds were extremely comfortable.  We booked two rooms and the staff accommodated our request to be on the same floor.  The hotel was extremely convenient for its location to Broadway shows and great restaurants.  The staff and especially the bellman and doorman were very helpful.,1
Rooms were clean and beds and pillows comfortable. Hotel is situated in a great location of Times Square which is central and convenient. Good restaurants by the hotel entrance. Mixed experience in staff and customer service at the front desk and restaurant. Door and concierge staff very knowledgeable| helpful and friendly but some front desk and restaurant staff need to be overhauled in customer service! It would have been helpful if front desk informed us of their amenities such as their restaurant and the great breakfast buffet when we checked in. But overall a very good hotel and I would definitely stay there again.,1
Staff was unresponsive. Didn't come to clean my room until after 5pm. Bed very uncomfortable. Room smelled dirty. Bathroom was very dirty. Checkout at 11:00 am. Overall terrible experience| won't stay again.,0
horrible in every single regard apart from the location.,0
The room is a bit old| but is clean and very big for NYC.,1
While the location was amazing. The lobby immaculate. The rooms were dated and smelled old. My room was not very clean and the hallway carpet was very stained and old looking.,0
Very friendly staff | the room was clean and the bed very comfortable| very close to most shopping areas | and subway stations,1
Location is excellent! A breakfast buffet would be nice to add to the stay.,1
Not great. No hand towels or face cloths| no blanket for the bed. An ironing board but no iron. Disappointing at best.,0
Second time I have stayed at this hotel & will stay again next time I go to New York. Very short distance to Times Square. Friendly| helpful staff.,1
Location| service| cleanliness. Mr Mitty and the doormen enjoy assisting guests.,1
Great Hotel.  I've stayed here a couple of times and I love it.  It is close to EVERYTHING and the service is always excellent.  Rooms are comfortable and big for New York Standards.,1
great locationgreat hotelpls keep coffee / tea in room,1
I was in town for Springsteen on Broadway.  I loved this hotel.  Perfect location.  Everything in walking distance.  Very clean and friendly staff.  Will stay again.,1
Our fault in booking a hotel in Times Square it felt like a hassle getting to our hotel each time. Hotel rooms are tired no fridge or mini bar| and we were given the wrong room on our first night.,0
situation to a manager who did nothing. Will never stay here again!,0
Everything about the room was wonderful. I stayed on the 42nd floor and enjoyed an amazing view of Times Square. Would definitely recommend a stay at this hotel.,1
Perfect in the heart of Times Square with an amazing view | spacious room with king size bed .,1
Nice room.  a little noisy because of traffic.Wished there was toothpaste since I didn't bring any.Wished there was an extra blanket since the room was cold.Had to order an extra one.,1
No fridge and no microwave small room bed was comfy everything was clean check in was smooth,0
Lovely clean hotel ideal location|,1
Ideal location for Times Square. Some of the rooms could use some TLC like new carpets and bathroom. Other than that it was ideal.,1
Nice hotel. The location is EXCELLENT. very clean| great staff,1
Bedding were not clean there was no coffee maker bath room was dirty room was too small,0
I had an amazing stay. Every time I stay| it's never been short of exceptional. I had a corner room with views of Times Square and it was the best! The rooms are always clean| the bed is soft but firm| and the service I've always received has set the bar high for me which is why I return. I live in NYC now so I will be booking here if I want a little weekend getaway!,1
I this is a beautiful hotel right in the middle of Times Square with beautiful views nice staff and very clean and I just cannot say enough good things about how much I liked it I could go on all day but suffice it to say when I can go there and when I have to go to New York this is the place I want to go,1
The hotel was nice.  However| you get charged 21.78/day for internet service (which we never had| even after telling them.) and workout center ( which you won't use with all the walking you do ). We were also charged for breakfast for one of the three mornings we were there.  They apologized and took it off our bill| as we had a complimentary breakfast buffet.  The carpet in the room wasn't the cleanest| but doable.  Second day our bath towels were replaced with ones that had holes in them| and only given one wash cloth for two people.  But staff was very nice| waiters at breakfast were excellent and location is great!  I would stay here again.,1
The bathroom was dirty. Not clean enough.,0
That was a great experience!,1
Well located but that's all. The hotel is definitely not a 4 stars. No fridge or water bottle in the room. Light bulb missing on the lamps| cold cigarette smell in the room| old carpet. No indication upon checkin on the hotel facilities (there is probably no facility). Bed sheet on the wrong side...Will really not recommend this hotel or go back there,0
The room is super small and quite old| a big difference with the photo on the website.  We have 3 people but only 2 glasses in the bathroom.  No water boiler/tea and coffee/coffee cups and one light bulb is not working in the room.  Called front desk at 10pm but they replied that only one person was there and asked us to wait. We waited for 2 hours and no one showed up to bring us the things.  Next morning we talked to the lady who cleaned the rooms| she helped us to bring one glass and called her colleague to give us the coffee and coffee cups.  She also helped to call someone to fix the light bulb.  Forget to ask the lady's name but she was extremely helpful and we appreciated.  When we checked out| the front desk told us that a US$25 facility fee was charged daily| unhappy to pay the extra fee with terrible service in this hotel.,0
Location great as always| the hotel is lacking all service| no room service| closed restaurant on saturdays and mondays.  Thought the rooms would be nicer compared to the pics before booking. bed was comfy  Needs a serious update| mould beginning to grow in the bathroom| dirty windows| i chose a city view but was not at all close to the views on pics. I decided to try something new was not worth it... Would not go there again and def not worth the money can get much better for less money,0
Convenient! This is one of the most important features for travellers.,1
Our first room we got was the dirtiest room ever| things were broken in it. It was just a mess. We got another room after complaining and that room was on the 51 floor and it was nice. The service in the hotel was the worst I ever experienced. No one said even hi to you| just awful. We had breakfast one of the days and I highly recommending that you don't pay extra for it since it was not good. The view on the 51 floor was very beautiful!,0
Very disappointed. Booked through hotels.com . Excited about the breakfast. But when I arrived. There wasn't any breakfast. Just a brown bag with a very small yogurt. A disgusting breakfast sandwich that the bread crumbled in your hand . Your lucky if you got one with a napkin or a spoon . 4 days 4 guesses.The description of the rooms were off. A city view is just looking at another's building.The vineyard view (not sure were a vineyard is in nyc)but you get a beautiful view of the harbor. Wont make that mistake again.,0
The staff were friendly| the hotel and room were clean| and the bed was comfortable. I would definitely stay there again.,1
Liked that we had a awesomeview,1
This property is closer to some of the attractions and also conveniently located to take ferries or train to other attractions which we liked the most|,1
Everything was great and the staff helpful and friendly.,1
Property was at waking distance from multiple attractions in Uptown Manhattan,1
The property was great. Loved the location and it's easy access to the subway. I however did not like the setup of the bathroom. The door did not close all the way.,1
Clean room. Friendly staff. Excellent views.  Convenient location.,1
Friendly staff felt very welcomed after a long drive.  Quiet and the subway station was nearby.  Great stay!  I Will def stay again.,1
Check in late at night| to find my room completely dirty| with hair all over the bathroom and the shower clogged. They didn't even offer a room change. They set staff to take care of the clogged| but ultimately I had to clean the shower. Next day asked to be cleaned and they only cleaned the shower| they didn't even make an effort to do the rest. Very disappointing!!,0
Overall great accommodations - location| convenience| attentive friendly staff| cleanliness and an amazing view from our room!,1
The site said restaurant. There was no restaurant. Site said valet parking. There was no valet parking. Couldn't have room cleaned,0
The location was very convenient. Lots of choices for food and public transportation across the street. The room also had a microwave and mini fridge. The only thing that bothered me was the stale smell in the room.,1
The room was really comfortable| and so was the view!,1
The view overlooking The Hudson from the 21st floor was fabulous! Clean rooms| friendly staff and very quiet.,1
I really liked this hotel and location. The staff was friendly| but seemed to be a bit understaffed. I was disappointed to learn after check in that the restaurant was closed.,1
The location of this hotel is excellent to say the least. Too many restaurants to choose from and to walk around the area as well. Too many to see in New York. The staff was pleased and welcoming to us. Check in and out was quick. Our room had a great view to the bridge. If I have to say something negative is the TV didnt work but other than that it was a great stay.,1
Nice room| great shower. Overall very good. If I have two complaints it's that the hotel bar is tiny and secondly and more importantly I could hear street noise on my 22nd floor room that I don't pick up at other hotels. For where the conference was this was a great location.,1
Great location and staff was very friendly.  Views are great!,1
Our room was clean and the service from the front desk staff was great.  Put flight out was later and they held our bags so we could explore NYC longer without dragging our stuff.,1
The floor that we stay will smell from drugs and smell from dust we couldn't to see any view of the of the water they told us it's going to be a ocean view ocean front view,0
Proximity to everything. Breakfast was great! Nice staff.,1
Super clean | very nice | staf very nice |the view is awesome,1
Nice staff| comfortable roomsThe front sidewalk is under construction| so there is no valet and its more difficult to unload bags from a vehicle. No attendant was present outside to give direction.,1
Staff was pleasant and provided great customer service.,1
the stay was awesome however the shower door only opened one way and the door didnt close all the way cause the wall was crooked. so when you took a shower the door would roll open letting the water out on the floor. not only that since the one side was solid when you turned the water on to adjust the temp would would get sprayed and wett. so when you shower make sure you are undressed before you turn the water on and adjust it after getting undressed.,1
First time staying downtown. Learned much about old New York| from a comfortable and convenient location. Started every day with a great breakfast served and prepared by by a wonderful staff. üëçüëç,1
Everything was great. Had a better time than expected.thank you :),1
I loved my room here. It was nice size with a beautiful view (don't hesitate on a ‚ÄòCity View' room| it's worth it) and also complimentary Neutrogena products. The bed was also comfy. The location is great and it's a Starbucks right around the corner. I will definitely stay here again.,1
Convenient spot! Very clean| friendly staff| bed is very comfortable.,1
Traveled to NY for a weekend getaway.  This hotel was EXCELLENT| the service from everyone (front counter customer service| housekeeping staff) was great.  The hotel is in a very walkable area and there are many places to eat and enjoy NY nightlife.  The next time I come to NY I will be staying at this hotel again FOR SURE|||,1
My sister and I stayed here previously and had a great stay both times. The staff are so wonderful and friendly| and the location is great :),1
Convenient location to subway| friendly staff| nice view of water. Left some valuables in the room at check out by accident. Contacted the hotel several hours after checkout and they reported the items were never found. We reported exactly where they were left in the room but staff said they could not find them. Items should have been easily found upon room inspection...yet nothing was reported found.,0
Convenient| clean.   Updated.  Friendly.  .........,1
The staff were very friendly and helpful. Will go back!,1
The staff could not have been more friendly and even assisted us with an early check in. The room was clean and comfortable and the elevator very fast. The lobby was nice and my friend was very happy that coffee was already made and waiting downstairs every morning. The location is very close to the subway and the Staten Island ferry as well as drugstores and bagel shops so it was perfect for us. It was also very quiet. It was a nice getaway from the crowds and noise in Midtown.,1
I was surprised how big the room was compared to some other hitels I have stayed in NYC. The staff has to be the BEST hitel staff I've ever deakt with. They accomadated me with a early check in (1130AM) and gave me a room on their lowest floor (that was also a early request). The staff well you can't get any better. Rooms were clean and comfortable just an outstanding hotel. The only setback would be no free breakfast that would make this hotel a 10 for sure but it still gets a 9.5.,1
Had no issues with this hotel. Clean and efficient.,1
Great touches like coffee/tea| infused water| cookies in the lobby and snacks and bottled water for the marathon runners on Sunday morning.,1
It was a good stay| I just was not aware of the water bottle being a charged on my card,1
Great location| clean| staff great| will be back again,1
It was easy to get to the trains to get us around the city,1
We stayed for two nights and the room was clean.The staff was friendly and we had a room with a nice view . I will definitely will come back soon .,1
All was ok| the staff| claning| location| maybe the option for parking the car has to be upgraded,1
Staff at Hilton Gardens are outstanding. Rooms are small but clean and adequate.,1
Hotel is fresh and clean| pleasant and comfortable rooms in a quiet location offering good nights sleep. Hotel facilities are otherwise basic,1
Great staff| excellent room| fresh coffee in the AM. Will stay again in the future.,1
The friendliness of the staff.  I was standing on a long line with only one person at the check in desk.  This young man clearly does not work at the desk but he was asking everyone what kind of help he could do for us.  He offered us water | cookies or if we were all here to checking in.   The guests who were checking out he pull them off the line.  Beautiful and well done,1
Great Location. Great Customer Service.,1
Room was very nice| very close to subway and stores.,1
Great hotel in excellent location. Friendly and efficient service staff who make you feel at home. Location was fabulous for sight seeing but being in a quieter location. Subway stations so close and a village feel in the old section around Stone street.,1
I didn't enjoy the view of the other buildings but the building was nice and the staff was excellent which made up for it.,1
Happy in all. Important to me: Baggage hold service| good breakfast| noon check out| polite service.,1
Very satisfied. Great location| friendly staff| superbly clean and comfortable.,1
Near by battery park and nice place. Ease of access with valet parking,1
Great staff| nice location. Clean rooms| overall great hotel,1
Feiendly staff| rooms are bigger compare to the other hotel ive stayed at in the area,1
Super friendly staff. Perfect location. Clean rooms.,1
Great location. Lovely room| with comfortable bathroom.  Bigger than the typical NYC hotel rooms.  The service was excellent. We needed some small things| like band-aid| and they deliver to us quickly.  Greatly recommended.,1
1st time in NYC and stayed here with family in connecting rooms. Everyone was extremely pleased with the accommodations and experience. We would stay here again.,1
Great location and close to many transportation options. The linens were amazing! We did hear doors slamming throughout the night and morning. Other than that it was perfect.,1
Our window shade came out of the wall and hit my mom on the head. That was upsetting. Room 2505. Seems to be hanging on by a thread with only one nail on each side in drywall. My mom is an older woman. It was disturbing and the front desk employees were surprised and did nothing. Beautiful space| easy check in| just an odd experience.,1
only suggestion would be to open room service earlier on Sunday,1
My friends and I decided to stay here for our weekend trip and we must say we really enjoyed ourselves! Our check in representative Max was really amazing! He made sure we had everything we needed to ensure the comfortability of each guest. We really appreciated Max! We definitely will be staying again.,1
Nice space| updated room| convenient to subways.,1
Location was great!! The staff were really nice and very helpful. The hotel was clean and the room was large.,1
Exceptional Good location: subway| sightseeing Comfortable stay.,1
Staff was very nice and helpful| rooms were really clean.,1
I like the fridge and the microwave. I didn't like the fact that it didn't come with breakfast,0
It bit disappointed really| staff were friendly and the check in was great.  The floor we were on was a tired and dirty.  We stayed five nights and every day| for the whole day and night| there was a hoover and the cleaners cupboard outside our room was open!!  The hotel was great for access all things Manhattan.  The room was small| but I guess that is the thing with Garden Inn's.  We have stayed at hundreds of Hilton Brand Hotels around the world and I think its time to shift our loyalty now.,1
The check in process was simple and quick| the room was clean and large enough for 2 adults and 2 teenagers (have stayed in some small rooms in the US). Location is great for a base in Manhattan - away from the craziness| but quick and easy to get anywhere with plenty of subway stops within walking distance. All staff were friendly and and helpful.We would certainly stay here again.,1
The hotel is in a great location - very close to the metro station and plenty of places to eat around.,1
great hotel but the key card system wasn't working during our stay so we had to wait for a manager to let us in each time we wanted to get in our room.,1
Great location close to the financial area and to the ferry terminal.,1
Excellent experience... quick check-I in by friendly staff| immaculately clean rooms| quiet atmosphere form street traffic and great location. I highly recommend,1
Loved our stay| location and very friendly staff! Looking forward to returning!,1
The location was perfect for sites and access to the subway. View from room was fantastic. Hotel was beautiful and clean. Top notch.,1
Everything was great except turn down service which never happened.  I asked the maid to come back in an hour and she never came.  I left the hotel and returned mid afternoon and was informed they had left and was only offered clean towels. Was pretty upset about that.     Self parking is 2 blocks away for $40 or valet for $50 daily w/ no reentry.,1
Easy access to all points in the city with less of the overwhelming crowds of midtown. Quiet and clean. Great service.,1
Great location and views from the rooms.    The breakfast is overpriced (as most things in NYC) but in this case it is the equivalent (or less) of what many hotels in other parts of the country offer for free with an $89 room.,1
The hotel was great! But the employees made it even better they were so helpful and friendly! Highest possible rating!,1
All was great except that the bathroom was not clean this time. Found moderate amount of human hair in the shower hose and floor. Sheets and towels are looking dingy. I was surprised as we have stated in this hotel several times before and it was always immaculate .,1
This was a great place to stay.  Friendly staff| very clean| and great rooms with comfortable beds.  I would recommend this place for a visit to NYC!,1
I liked how clean our room was and that the elevators were new and everything was a bit upgraded| we even had a cute coffee machine and refrigerator which we used and a microwave and a desk.,1
The room was small and didn't look clean. The view was terrible(side effect for booking from expedia I guess). Will avoid booking hotels from expedia in future. Very disappointed.,0
Valet parking is a joke and extremely careless. In a rush we didn't do a walk thru of our van. Only to notice and hr later as we tried to open the passenger sliding door that there was a dent| scratches and wouldn't fully open. We worked so hard to take good care of our car only to have a careless stranger damage it.  It was definitely while they had our vehicle! Terrible end to our vacation! PLEASE triple check your vehicle before leaving. Never again will we do valet parking anywhere. Hilton needs to do better! Will update.,0
Nice hotel. It is clean and good service. It is in NYC Financial District so it's far from lot of touristic attractions. However| it has several metro stations nearby to go everywhere in the city. I highly recommend it.,1
Room was not ready during check in,1
Great location and view but $17 for a continental breakfast is a little much.,1
Location excellent. Good for family vacation (so many historic sites right nearby) or business visit to Financial District alike. Did not try food| looked good. View nice. Got a good sleep. Thank you to great staff!,1
Clean. Quiet. Nice location. But Beware of hidden charges.,0
I wish they could get rid of carpets in hotels though...So much cleaner with hardwood floors.,1
Love this hotel! The staff is great and the rooms are always clean and comfortable.,1
Superb location for Lower Manhatten with helpful and friendly staff.,1
Great deal for a centrally located Manhattan option. My business was in Brooklyn| which made the Financial District address really perfect: Downtown Brooklyn was less than 30 minutes away via train. Multiple subway option within minutes| too.Staff was out of this world attentive and professional. Couldn't have asked for more in this area.Rooms were clean| comfortable| and well stocked with extras.My only complaint? It would have been nice to have use of a complimentary bathrobe.,1
Great area| plenty to do n see will visit again,1
Service good . Bedroom comfortable and clean. Restaurant  area clean but basic. Not very inviting to eat there although food was ok,1
It was close to Staten island ferry.............       ...................,1
I liked how close it was to the metro. And to the ferry.I didn't like that we never received clean sheets in the 4 nights we stayed. The fan in the bathroom was broken. And when they changed our towels we didn't receive washcloths. I called the front desk the first time. I didn't receive them for anther 2 hours they brought us hand towels instead of wash cloths. I was told I couldn't get a wash cloth for another 4 hours.  The next time they changed the towels I saw the house keeping in the elevator and told them I need wash cloths. Another couple in the elevator told house keeping they had not received any towels at all. We came in very late and found hand towels instead of wash cloths. I didn't call front desk because we were tired and had to leave at 5 am for the plane. Very disappointed. The manager used the excuse that house keeping had trouble with English and communication. Training is needed on how to put the bathroom together and maybe test them. I usually stay at La Quinta or Comfort Inn. Where breakfast is included and have no issues with house keeping. I thought Hilton was as good as these girls but I was filled and will be going back to the tried and true. Very disappointed.,0
Loved the location| near ferries| and great pubs (Dead Rabbit and Lovelace) and one block to metro station.  Room was bigger than most in NYC and very newly decorated.  Only complaint is that the shower faucet moved from hot to cold constantly.  .,1
Convenient location| but generally must cross street for ride share and taxi.,1
The staff was amazing| very welcoming and the room was perfect! I would definitely recommend this hotel on either business or personal.,1
This was a fair price for the room| location & amenities. The mattress was a little hard and the blankets could've used a heavier one too| not just a light duvet and coverlet. This is quibbling though...my stay was wonderful| quiet| and the staff was GREAT.,1
A very clean hotel and very new.  Great big king bed in our regular sized room.,1
This is a wonderful hotel in lower Manhattan.  It is across the street from the Staten Island Ferry| blocks from the World Trade Center Memorial and smack dab in the heart of historical Manhattan.  I was fortunate enough to get a free upgrade to a water view room and spent my early mornings sipping coffee and watching the ferry come and go.,1
Front desk staff were phenomenal!  The location cannot be beat.  Super clean and modern.  I prefer a little bit of a harder bed and pillows (wall too fluffy)| so that is my only reason for not giving it a 5/5.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat though!,1
Newly renovatedPretty bathroomRiverview roomTasty| reasonably priced meals at the grill,1
The ONLY complaint is the parking! One of the reason I booked this hotel because they had parking but the website did not specify the conditions of parking there. First| it's about 4 blocks away and second you have to pay each time you leave. But staff was very friendly and rooms are very nice.,1
That is was clean and quiet. I also like that its positioned in a great part of Manhattan especially for tourism.,1
Had a great visit at the hotel. The staff where warm and friendly. Even when I was crying in the stairwell the  maintenance worker asked me if I was OK and that was very nice of him.,1
Their food was amazing and the staff was very very respectful!,1
My husband and I stayed here one night with our two young boys. Although the room was a little small| it was clean and well laid out. It was convenient to have a mini fridge and microwave for the kids' snacks. The staff was very friendly. A parking garage with discounted rate for hotel guests is just 2 blocks away.,1
There's free coffee and water in the lobby which is very good! Room is clean,1
toilet was not clean.  previous visits were better,1
Great place to stay for the weekend in NYC. Close to the Ferry. Very clean.,1
it was lovely. there was a long wait for the elevators| but other than that| it was pretty good. really nice staff,1
Great location. Nice property with a friendly staff.,1
Everything perfect,1
The location of this hotel was very convenient to the 1 train at south ferry. The price was also great compared to comparable hotels.,1
Rooms are very small. No Pool. Limited hours for room service. Limited food options. No continental breakfast offered.,0
This location was clean| staff was friendly| and the hotel was in a perfect location for me!,1
Affordable for the location.  Really liked the way the room was set up.  Loved that the cheapest rate still had a king size bed.  you don't see that a lot in Manhattan.  Close to subway stations so it was fairly easy to get around.  Staff were very friendly and timely and attentive to my needs.  I would stay here again.,1
Excellent .all staff was great. Food was good. Room clean,1
The hotel property was nice; it was clean and comfortable and the staff were friendly.,1
Hotel location was perfect| easy access to subways| taxis| and the ferry. Within walking distance to local cafes| restaurants| 9/11 memorial| Statue of Liberty| Wall st. and most iconic monuments. The hotel staff was kind and went out of their way to satisfy our needs. Room was perfect for our 4 day stay. Very clean and modern. Comfy bed| hot water| blow dryer| iron| full size ironing board| small fridge| safe| Keurig| and BONUS* they had a microwave in the room. Walk across the street and catch the subway to Times Square's or just about anywhere else. Will absolutely stay here again.,1
Location was close to many great things like Battery Park| multiple subway stops| WTC| etc. However| the hotel itself was just okay. The staff was great| but our shower doors didn't close all the way| some of the lights in our room didn't work| and the fixtures in the shower were crooked and moving. In addition| they never gave us our Breakfast Vouchers since we bought the breakfast included package| so both mornings we had to have the waiter call the front desk to verify we didn't need to pay. Breakfast itself was good overall: Belgium waffles| pancakes| French toast| omelette bar| cereal| yogurt| fruit| oatmeal| etc. I would stay at the location again| but there is definitely room for improvement as a property.,1
Location was perfect. Rooms were great. Staff was warm and attentive.,1
Had a pleasant stay with no issues or complaints whatsoever,1
The hotel is pleasant looking and clean. The room was small and they view was nonexistant but all in all it was ok. One easy change they can make to improve stay is get normal size coffee cups for the coffee in the lobby. They were so small LOL. I liked the fruit water in the evenings. I liked that I could walk to restaurants and a drug store. It was cool to be across from the Staten Island Ferry.,1
Awesome views| great location great dining nearby  Higley Reccomend,1
Great location| clean hotel and friendly staff.,1
Great| very clean....just really cramped for a family of four.  I would recommend based on location| staff and cleanliness!,1
Perfect stay-cation with mini fridge and microwave in the room.,1
Great location| safe area| close to subway entrances| restaurants and a Duane reade pharmacy store. Def will stay here again.,1
Everyone was helpful from start to finish. Among many other things I liked the best was the breakfast and dinner. Hotel was extremely clean.,1
Very friendly staff. Always willing to store our luggage. Close to a few subway trains. Great Bar and Restaurant.,1
Right downtown.  Great staff| they gave me suggestions on where to go nearby for dinner.,1
I have stayed at the Garden Inn many times and is always a pleasant stay,1
We loved our stay over looking the Staten Island Ferry area. Fun to watch all the boats in the ocean.,1
Unbelievable location and a comfortable stay. Staying at the Hilton Garden Inn made a work trip enjoyable.,1
The staff were friendly| helpful and always smiling. They gave us directions and recommendations to help us have a genuine NYC experience. Thank you to Bianca| Nikko| Lee| Nisiki and Matthew...and really everyone we encountered.,1
Only recommendation is for better lighting in bath. One ceiling light in middle room. Poor lighting for makeup. Add small lighted makeup mirror.,1
Nice staff. Nice room. Breakfast is overpriced for what is offered. Linens only changed every 3rd day and found that out after reading cards in room since the linen wasn't changed. I would have asked for linen change after 2 nights if I had know policy up front.  Front desk staff should mention this policy upon check in.,1
Friendly staff and close to amenities clean but small,1
Only failing was a big one- my friend left behind her passport which the hotel found upon checkout but didn't notify us when we came to collect our bags in the evening or even call/contact us. Involved a very stressful journey back into NYC to get it and a transferred flight.,1
Nice stay close to the ferry and subway station. Quiet area.,1
great location| very pleasant staff| clean and modern rooms,1
The hotel was great. Staff was courteous and very helpful. The location is great. Easy access to subway and the Staten Island Ferry.  My only complaint is that on the morning of the NYC Marathon| my daughter as well as a few other runners went for a quick bite to eat before the race. Being that you cannot eat much prior to running a marathon| my daughter ate one piece of toast with peanut butter with a glass of water. That piece of toast cost her $35. Why she had to pay for a full continental breakfast is beyond me. It would have been nice had they run a special for whatever marathon runners staying with them to have a quick alternative to the $35 option. It would have made all the difference to us| having booked two rooms solely to support her and the other runners.,1
Had a wonderful time in this location. Will definitely come back.,1
Close to Ferry| nice place to stay for NYC marathon runners.,1
Great . Clean and easy. Close to the train line and close to attractions,1
Close to public transportation.  Would have liked some more clothing storage.  Two little drawers was not enough.,1
Nice hotel good helpful staff. Easy walk through Financial District and to 911 Memorial,1
Great Hotel and amazing customer service!!Great location| easy to transportation and touristic places| great view to the harbor.,1
Convenient and clean which is most important. I was surprised by the friendly welcoming staff and their willingness to help!,1
Good value in Manhattan. Very nice room at an affordable price.,1
Amazing service and advice from someone who hadn't travelled in NYC before!!!,1
Well situated hotel with nice rooms| quite spacious for new york at that price. Clean room and bathroom| easy access. Close to the metro and easy access to about anywhere on the island. Would recommend,1
This was the nicest| spacious and cleanest hotel that I've ever stayed at in NYC. I'm not sure when it was built| but the hotel is modern and looks brand new. The staff is friendly and greeted us each time we walked passed the front desk. It's in the Financial District| so in the evenings it's a little quieter than hotels in midtown. Plus| there's no resort fee like some of the hotels in midtown. We also had a view of the Staten Island Ferry Station and water| which was a pleasant surprise. I will definitely be back and recommend this hotel - you won't be disappointed. I didn't take pics of the room| but what you see online is accurate. There's also a fridge and microwave in the room.,1
The location is superb. Very close to the Statue of Liberty| wall St| World Trade Centre and Staton Island ferry,1
Updated and only a year old! Staff was friendly and restaurant was good!,1
The hotel was very nice.  Across the street from the subway station at Battery Park and walking distance to the World Trade Center|  We arrived late but were able to get a meal at the restaurant.  We had a great view of the Hudson.  They held our luggage while we were sight seeing after we checked out.   Breakfast was not free as it is in most Hilton Inn's.,1
The overall is good. The hotel locate in a very convenience place| close to about 3 subway stations| and also surrounded by some restaurants.,1
The room was very clean and modern.  The view of the harbor was magnificent,1
Room was great! On the last night of our stay the room next to us was having a VERY loud argument. We eventually called down to the front desk as it sounded like a man was punching walls/throwing things. The front desk didn't seem to care as random screaming would continue through the rest of the night.,1
The location was perfect for sightseeing in lower Manhattan.   The room and the bathroom were beautiful.  The only downside was that the closet was a strange size.  The staff was outstanding.,1
The property was nice. The staff was friendly and the room was clean. The rooms are big compact for my taste,1
There were plenty of dining options to choose from all within walking distance. This is a great location if you plan on visiting the 9/11 memorial site| the Statue of Liberty| Ellis Island| etc. So if you need to be in the financial district for any reason| I would recommend this hotel as a great place to stay.,1
Great location right at the center of everything downtown!,1
Great place would stay there again. Super comfortable bed and nice and clean room and bathroom.,1
There was no water offered in the hotel.  Or even toileteries. I was there for one night and first time some hotel has charged a 50$ security deposit ! Even the staff did not seem to be pleasant . Overall| I was really pissed off by their services.,0
Second time staying at this hotel. Unfortunately the housekeeping was not up to the standard we first experienced when the hotel first opened last September. We noted the vacuum was not used regularly if at all| the bed sheets were not changed as per Hiltons Hotel policy and coffee/milk pods not replaced| had to go to reception three times to ask for them. Having said this it would not stop me from booking again.,1
Hotel Conveniently located for ferries to Staten Island| Ellis Island| Statue of Liberty & Governor's Island.,1
Great clean hotel!  All staff was extremely friendly and helpful| this made our stay a memorable one.  Highly recommend this hotel.,1
Checking in was smooth and stress free front desk clerk was fast and friendly i will stay here again,1
Everything wa excellent except the breakfast. $23 for a mediocre breakfast and $13 for mediocre contentential was too high!,1
One of the nicest cleanest hotels in Manhattan| great rooms and an even better staff. So much to do in the area| bars and restaurants| and many subway lines within 2 minutes| will always go back.,1
All doors entering the room stuck and had to be pushed or shouldered to open and close.,0
Very clean and neat room. Staff was very courteous and friendly,1
Clean| newer| comfortable| nice view. We chose this for its proximity to battery park.,1
Perfect location was a great experience Nice staff clean,1
Convenient location in Lower Manhattan!,1
Hotel is nice and new but bed is way too soft and seems fairly cheap in quality.,1
This will be our go-to hotel in the Battery Park area. We come to NY once a week for work and this hotel is a quick cab or train ride to anywhere in the city you want to go. It is also very close to Brooklyn. We walked to the World Trade Center memorial site| Wall Street area| and saw lots of great restaurants along the way. I highly recommend it.,1
The location of the hotel was ideal for us as we had plans to see the Statue of Liberty. The room was small but comfortable and clean. It also had a microwave and fridge which are great amenities for families with small children. The doorman and valet were very helpful.,1
The staff was super helpful! The only thing that was hard was sharing a double bed instead of a queen. The area was perfect access to walk to the Statue of Liberty ferry and down to the 9/11 memorial.,1
Great location in the finance district| and a great deal! I'd definitely stay again. In a NY minute... (I know. Corny...),1
Equally great as a couple getaway or business hotel. Location is super convenient! Constant fan AC setting is nice. Clean and comfortable.,1
The room was comfortable and the location is perfect. Steps to Battery Park and the waterfront| tons of delicious food and drinks nearby. Staff were friendly and helpful - although just one small thing I had requested (silverware delivered to the room so I could set up a surprise birthday cake for my boyfriend) I was told to go downstairs to the restaurant to find someone to ask for it. I was fully capable of doing that| it just would have been nice to have the little luxury of having it delivered to the room. They may have been busy and I understand. Thanks for a great stay.,1
The location of this hotel is excellent. Access to the subway is across the street or 2 blocks away| depending on which line you need to use.The area is open and very close to the water.There is always a nice breeze even in very hot days of summer. Multiple places nearby to dinne or just get a quick snack.,1
Check in was smooth. The room was clean and a decent size. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.,1
The rooms are consistent with what you'll find in other New York properties as far as size| but are clean and quiet with a helpful| friendly staff. My one complaint about the hotel is that the fitness center in the basement is relatively spartan and extremely warm every time I've been.,1
Location was great. The roll-in shower was  awful and gets messy.  I can hear  outside noise but overall it's a great hotel.,1
We stayed here for 2 nights before joining a coach tour to Niagara and the location was great for walking to Brooklyn Bridge| ferry to Statue of Liberty| Wall Street and 9/11 memorial. Comfortable rooms| modern and a good size.,1
Great location| across from Battery Park and within walking distance of 911 monument and museum| charging bull| American Indian Museum etc. room and hotel were very clean and staff very helpful. Room small but clean and comfortable.,1
All good on most aspects. Only negative was that the room was not ready at 3 pm. Had to wait 30 mins.,1
The hotel is great - the rooms had more space then I would anticipate for a NYC hotel.  It was very clean and quiet.,1
Had an amazing stay and a beautiful view I would definitely recommend.,1
Nice new (or newly renovated) hotel very near Battery Park| close to Financial District. Water side has nice views of the harbor and Governor's Island. Highly professional staff| rooms are very good size for Manhattan. Not the most fun neighborhood| but some restaurants and bars.,1
Great building| great location| great staff (Martin was a great help). Everyone was very friendly. The location is very secure with food| drink| public transport (subway| ferries| etc) all very close. Rooms were very modern| clean| spacious| and quiet. I definitely recommend this hotel.,1
Absolutely loved this hotel. Location was great| the view was amazing. The staff were extremely courteous and very helpful with information about the local area.,1
The hotel is right by the water and the environment is actually very nice.  My room is very clean and all the necessities are provided.  just a note that the housekeeping didn't come clean my room but since I only stayed for two nights| I was not bothered by it.,1
Everything was perfect! I'm happy with my choice.,1
Great view of the water,1
Everyone was move and the hotel was great. The best thing was the people. Staff was extremely helpful and went out of their way to answer our questions and assist us in any way they could. They were friendly and welcoming. Our room was spacious and very clean. I would highly recommend this hotel.,1
Very nice hotel| very clean!! only thing I didn't like was the door opened directly into the bed area| there was no hallway you entered so it was a little loud when people were coming and going from other rooms,1
Nice hotel close to South Staten Island Ferry station| Financial District| and the R Subway line. Hotel facilities are in excelent condition. Bathroom is spacious and modern. Carpets are clean and rooms come with iron| a small fridge| and microwave!!!,1
Excellent location near ferry and subway. Room was a little small. Nice conditions and towel with a/c,1
Staff is wonderful!. Great location.  Food is good.,1
Very please- would recommend any time. Clean- safe- confortable- good service,1
Nice hotel| close to the subways.,1
Nice comfortable| clean and convenient location.,1
Nice hotel! Close to Battery Park. Away from the hussle of New York to relax for a quiet evening! Staff is really friendly!,1
Loved the bathroom. need directions on the ac vent that the thermostat controls it.,1
Business on Stanton Island. Close to Ferry dock and to subway. Easy to get around,1
Great location| pleasant service and clean room,1
Nice hotel.  Good view of water.  We would go back and stay at the hotel again.,1
Very close to the subway| reasonable size room| bery clean| bed is very comfortable| have microwave and refrigerator which allows us to eat breakfast in the hotel and to not waste leftovers.,1
The hotel is in a great location.  Lots of restaurants in the area.   The hotel staff was very nice and accommodating.   The hotel is very very clean.  I highly recommend staying at this hotel.,1
This was my second time staying here. I love it! The rooms are spacious for NYC and very clean. Downtown location is perfect| multiple trains are near by. Hotel staff is great and are always willing to help. This is my go to hotel every time I am staying downtown.,1
Awesome location next to the Staten Island Ferry and Battery Park on the southern tip of Manhattan. The hotel is brand new| the staff is very courteous and eager to help. Breakfast on site is a bit steep at $24 considering that there are plenty of convenience stores and breakfast/food stores right around the corner. Rooms don't have much space to store your luggage. Nice view from our room. Bed was very cozy. Keurig coffee machines and hair dryers in every room. The Financial District is not that quiet during the weekends and stores are indeed  open.,1
Clean hotel and friendly staff. Great location too!,1
Nice renovated hotel| close to most subway lines| and good restaurants. It is a good cost benefit hotel.,1
Great location! The rooms were a good size and tge view was good as well!,1
Great location| convenient to Staten Island Ferry and subway stations...lots of cute breakfast places around as well as dinner places.  Really clean and up to date room and amenities. Will definitely stay again!,1
The check in was easy and the location was perfect for roaming the city! Enough room for two people and plenty of places/activities in the area.,1
Washroom door is a sliding door| does not allow privacy,1
Great hotel even though it is quite far from most everything we typically do.  It is great for the financial district| Statue of Liberty| 911 Memorial and Staten Island.  You will need transportation to most anything else but for the room quality I didn't mind taking an Uber to further away locations. Staff is great| rooms are immaculate and comfortable.,1
Perfect location-Nice hotel,1
Hotel was perfect location in downtown Manhattan! The people at the front desk were lovely and answered all my questions. Hotel room was clean and decent size for nyc,1
The location was perfect for our purposes and the staff was lovely.   Unfortunately the bathroom door would not stay shut and they only had 2 of 3 working elevators| often making for long waits.   But for the bathroom door and elevators| I would rate it very highly,1
Great stay. Very courteous and efficient stuff and wonderful location.,1
Great hotel let me check in early but the location was terrible spent so much money on trains from south ferry or Whitehall as on the weekends there is nothing in the area to do unless you are taking Staten Island Ferry,1
Clean| great location| great room.,1
great! will return!,1
Room was quite compact| but very comfortable.  Good bed linens| cushy towels -- not much drawer/closet space but didn't matter to us for our short stay.  Our 4th floor room had an unexpected bonus view of the Staten Island Ferry!  Location near the Battery was super convenient to our tour of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island.,1
We arrive a little bit early at the check in| they save our luggage and all good and friendly. They room is nice| not that big but is pretty| was really clean and comfortable. The personal is very helpful and quick. We tried the breakfast there and the waiters were very attentive. The location is perfect| metro is every where nearby and our room have a lovely view!. I love it and of course I will stay again with them in the future.,1
Visiting our son in FiDi. Excellent location.,1
The amazing staff made the difference. Comfortable room| good bed| and I assume relatively new showers.,1
Amazing location- room smelled brand new and was very clean,1
Great views and great food and service. I love staying here,1
Amazing view in amazing service,1
Easy access to metro.  Nice and clean.  Comforter is little old.,1
I always have an amazing time when I go to the Hilton this is one of my favorite ones in New York it has a great view the very top build it and they always give me the top floor only thing I would change I wish the room service was open aLittle longer between the times of 11 to 5 and later in the night at least about 12 other than that everything is perfect,1
Fast and friendly check in. Room was right in front of the elevator. Seems quiet so far!,1
It was an absolutely beautiful hotel. Close to Wall Street| the Stock Exchange and the Staten Island ferry. I will be back!!,1
The location was right across the street from the Staten Island Ferry and right around the corner from Statue of Liberty and financial district(Wall St.). There wasn't a whole lot of restaurants around or shopping areas around. The actual hotel was very clean. The rooms were kind of small but very comfortable. The hotel staff during the day was rude but I spoke with a manager who fixed my situation. This was my first time staying at Hilton hotel. Overall| the experience was pleasant| most likely would stay again.,1
Very satisfied with our stay| staff very friendly.,1
Good location| rooms are clean and nice. I recommend,1
Modern hotel close to Downtown attractions and shoreline.,1
Great hotel with nice friendly staffs. Well located| very close to ferry and subway. Definitely worth coming back,1
Really nice hotell. Nice location (quiet area!) with Dead Rabbit| Delmonico's and Black Tail in the block for food and cocktails. Slightly larger rooms than other comparable NY hotels. Super service from the front desk.,1
Hotel is in a perfect location| a few blocks from Millennium Park on the lake. The common areas are a little cramped as they tend to be in cities but the room was not.,1
This property  is an old office building  turn into a beautiful  hotel.,1
Great location in the theatre district!  Parking is a few blocks down.  Room was nice.  Portia who worked at the front desk was incredibly accommodating and helpful.,1
"I liked the location. Still not sure where is the ""hotel"" parking.",1
Overall great location and great parking that is 2 blocks away but great price. Comes with free breakfast. Not bad of a hotel. TV wouldn't work most of the time. Just a good budget place.,1
One needs an eagle eye to find the hotel as it blends into a  theater facade next door. Once ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù| however| the hotel and staff are great. It's an older facility but well maintained and accommodating. AND it's central: an easy walk to the Chicago Art Institute| Lake Michigan and its parks| the Chicago Symphony and a variety of restaurants.,1
The room was spacious| especially for a Chicago hotel. The location was great as it was within walking distance of the loop and had several restaurants within walking distance. The room was clean and comfortable. The free breakfast was nice and had a good number of options.,1
The newly-remodeled room was spacious. The bedding was super comfortable.  The provided breakfast was a step above the typical continental breakfasts of cereal| Danish and coffee provided at other hotels.  The accessibility to attractions and public transportation was superb.,1
There was a pair of dirty underwear left on the windowsill that the cleaners left in our room from the previous guest.,0
Centrally located.  Very clean.  Hot breakfast,1
Beautiful building| love the area| the staff was wonderful| we'll stay here again.,1
The best thing about this hotel is location location location. It is right next to 2 major L trains and almost every bus in the city stops on the corner; so if you plan to use public transport| it's a great choice. Also| it is in the middle of everything| walking wise. So if the Loop attractions and restaurants are your jam| this is great. The service is also good. The people are nice| and they are responsive to request. Now the less good parts: this is an old property that clearly has not been updated in ages. This means the decor is ancient| dark| and it all feels dingy (our room was nothing like the picture). The mattresses are also old| and quite uncomfortable. I woke up repeatedly every night| and had hip pain by the end. And the sheets are old| so they don't fit the mattress. Stretch them as you may -- they come off at multiple corners every night...And finally| the faucet design is such that it is at the very edge of the sink| meaning whenever you use it| water is all over the counter and your stuff. Dumbest design I have ever seen. In short| if your goal is sightseeing and you plan to spend minimal time in the hotel| and if you are a good sleeper| able to deal with some discomfort| this is the place for you. If you are more touchy about decor and your bedding--not for you.,1
Clean room. Close to attractions,1
It took 5 hours after our arrival to get checked in. The room was basic but clean. Staff was friendly.,1
No pool but a nice place for the price and location,1
Great location. Friendly| competent staff. Great hot breakfast. Comfortable beds. Shower that worked well.For a room at this price in downtown Chicago| I have no negatives to offer.Thanks for a good stay.,1
I had a great experience. When we called the front desk| we got what we asked for. Loved the location. It was clean.,1
This hotel was amazing from the location to the cleanliness of the room to the amazing staff. From beginning to end the staff was willing to accommodate any needs. They even texted me to see how things were and if i needed something,1
Great location and comfortable room,1
Everything was perfect except the breakfast was not so good. There are many restaurants around in this very central location.,1
The staff here is amazing. Honestly the nicest staff I have ever encountered. Even when we arrived  at three in the morning| the night clerk| Oscar| was outstanding with his service and personality. The hotel is perfectly located in the loop| one half block from the train line. Everything is walkable| and convenient.The rooms need a little attention. The bathroom door did not lock and you have to push the front door hard to be able to engage the deadbolt| but over all it was perfect and these didn't bother me too muchThe hotel is a historic building directly adjacent to a theater. In 1905 it was the tallest building in Chicago. They have kept cool vintage artifacts in place for visitors to appreciate.Breakfast was ok. Not many items for those with Celiac disease. Basically hard boiled eggs and fruit.For those that can eat gluten| there is a waffle maker| sandwich's| sausage| omelettes| cereal| etc.The breakfast attendant was exceptional. Even while we ate| she asked if she could get us anything else. That's excellent service.I WILL stay here again.,1
Amazing! The staff were extremely friendly| service was great|  the hotel was very clean| free delicious breakfast|  and it's located in a perfect location. If you're interested in being downtown where all the happenings are!,1
The staff was amazing!,1
What I didn't like was that the parking garage was not high enough for my truck. I needed parking garage of 7 ft and up| I had to park 10 blocks away from hotel. Other than that hotel stay was good.,1
Staff was great! Very polite| gave us flowers and a card for our anniversary even.,1
Perfect location.,1
The location was the best and the parking fee $20 /night  was reasonable. The staff was kind too. We will stay this hotel  again.,1
Amazing staff! Super friendly and patient when I didn't quite grasp how the parking worked. :),1
Great hotel location and spacious rooms. All front desk staff were very nice and good quick breakfast,1
We could't have asked for a better place to stay! First of all I had made a request for a room with a view and was not disappointed| the price point can not be beaten| the location is just perfect| with loads of shops| restaurants| CVs| and Target right around the corner. The Staff vas very friendly and accommodating. It was clean| updated but at the same time had a very victorian feel to it. We did not try the breakfast| bust saw a lot of people enjoying it. Over all we fell in love with the city| and the Hampton majestic was a big part of that impression. I also loved that the sound proof great.,1
Staff was friendly and efficientParking was easy Breakfast included,1
The staff was very nice and helpful during our stay.,1
excellent staff| polite and very helpful.  Everything I tried worked.  Good location.,1
The Chicago Majestic is an excellent hotel. The staff are excellent and went above and beyond expectations to make our stay pleasant. Great location in the Loop!,1
Great location. Within blocks of millennium park and art institute. In the heart of the theater district,1
Very clean| friendly and convenient location,1
Clean and well maintained. Budget friendly stay in downtown.,1
Everything we needed to do was walking distance within .5 mile,1
Friendly staff| clean common areas| clean room| and comfortable bed. Location is perfect| with red line around the corner and just a couple blocks from MI Ave. I would absolutely stay here again.,1
The staff was incredibly nice and helpful. I couldn't say enough good things about them. If I could give them ten stars I would. Parking is only $20 in garage but it is a block our so away. Upon arrival parked right in front of building (not between valet signs) and checked in before moving car to garage. Same when the trip ended. Retrieved car from garage and parked in front of hotel to load our luggage. Breakfast wasn't much and it was cold. Confusing entrance to building. You enter on the left side and lobby is not on the ground floor. Get on the elevator and select lobby button. Also| hotel should clean the outside of windows in rooms. We were on the 6th floor and could barely see out the window it was so dirty. If not for the great staff I would have rated this hotel 3 stars.,1
Only good thing is location rest everything is terrible,0
Excellent stay| although they should make parking instructions clearer on site. You have to go to the parking garage on 17 E Adams St| get the ticket and take back to hotel to be able to go in and out as many times as you like.,1
Stayed for one night at the beginning of April. Good value for the location and property. Off site parking| around the corner 1 block| was the cheapest I've ever seen in Chicago. $20 for the night and good until 5 pm the next day.Hotel was clean and spacious. Larger room than many other hotels in the area I've stayed at. Free breakfast was also available. Overall a positive experience. I would stay there again.,1
Nothing good bad service bad location bad everything,0
Hotel was very clean| walking distance fro Magnificent Mile,1
The Hampton Inn Majestic was perfect for our girls trip.  From storing luggage for us at the beginning and end of our stay| to providing boxed breakfasts| to just being friendly| personable| efficient| and kind| the hotel staff went above and beyond.  The room itself was sparkling clean and comfortable.  We had everything we needed.  The location was just right| and we were able to walk easily to shopping and attractions like Cloud Gate.  I would highly recommend the Hampton Inn Majestic and will be happy to stay there again.,1
Very courteous staff| clean hotel and room| and the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in! Also located in a perfect area| just a couple blocks from the main drag. Would absolutely stay here again!,1
Overall it was nice.  Yaneli was awesome.  We were able to check in and Yaneli helped us with parking.  Close to the bean and Millenium Park.,1
It was great but due to COVID restrictions the breakfast given was the same everyday| not so good.,1
This is a great place to stay right in downtown theater district!! My whole family loved it,1
Had a wonderful stay at the Hampton Inn Majestic!! Room was lovely| staff was very helpful and location was great. Would definitely recommend.,1
The property is beautiful and historic. I enjoyed the architecture and the location. The hotel is located near plenty of shopping| food and public transportation.,1
The historic style. The old elevators the staff the pictures. Not being able to the theater and no on-site parking.,1
The view from the windows was not that great. I wish I could have seen more of the skylinenof Chicago.,1
The front desk staff - especially Lemond was very friendly and helpful. The elevators can b slow but the location is ideal. There is a fridge in your room and a microwave in the lobby. Which is very convenient.,1
Hotel was great! Beds were comfy and room was clean. Guy checking us in was friendly and helpful.,1
Service was excellent!! Everyone was very friendly. One thing I didnt like was the comfort of the bed and pillows. They werent as soft as I expected.,1
I thought the girl who checked me in could have been more friendly.  I didn't like the breakfast boxes.  I am unsure how long they were sitting out and there were items that should be kept refrigerated.The room was comfortable and the location was great.,1
The location was a 3 block walk from Magnificent mile which was great| specially in a very Chicago cold night. Security was excelent. Room was disinfectanted abd very clean| with seal stickers on door| that let you know if broken the room was not cleaned! I was impressed. To go breakfast provided and great customer service! Highly recommended!,1
The hotel is really well maintained and clean. The staff was friendly and the check in and check out was pretty simple and fast. The hotel doesn't offers parking but there is one besides the hotel on Monroe St as well and there is another across the hotel as well. It's has a great location.,1
It's a very special building. I didn't know it was the tallest building in the city up until the beginning of the 1900's. Very centric location| just a couple blocks away from Millenium Park. KUDOS to the general manager for excellent customer service and attention. Will definitely book again.,1
Broken shower| unfriendly staff| super strange way to get into the building with absolutely no signage.,0
Great stay| friendly staff. Nice hotel with walking distance to many stores and restaurants,1
"This hotel is very centrally located in the heart of the Theater district. It is a quick 8-10 minute walk to Millennium Park one way| 8-10 minute walk to Sears Tower| and 15 minute walk to the Mag Mile. We used the subway to go north of the city and the stop is about 700 ft away. We also used the ""L"" train which the Adams/Wabash stop is only a couple blocks away. The staff were all very professional| check in and out was easy and contactless| rooms were clean and had a mini frig. With Covid| the breakfast is a box with yogurt| fruit| a bagel| and a bottled water. It was convenient to take on our adventures. Since there is no room service| I would have liked if they checked on us to see if we needed more towels| shampoo| take out trash| toilet paper. etc| since we were there 5 nights. The front desk did provide these if you requested more. Plus we were able to check in early. I would definitely stay here again!",1
Clean and very friendly| knowledgeable about the area. Very secure and loved the easy access to everything Chicago offers!,1
Absolutely amazing! Super clean and secure hotel in the heart of Chicago. Walking distance to everything!,1
Everything was good except when leaving the staff we asked for late check out and I know a pandemic going on however the manner in which I was spoken too was not pleasant and everyone else that came in afterwards was not asked for an ID,1
Clean accomadations|staff was helpful ans courteous. Enjoy my stay here and I hope to visit again.,1
Hotel is walking distance to a lot of attractions. There is a cvs close by that was convenient to get too.,1
Great location| friendly staff| super clean rooms with updated bathrooms. King bed was very comfortable. Overnight parking online is $17.,1
Customers service was A-1...,1
My stay was excellent| rooms were perfectly clean and staff was amazing. I was scared to travel during this pandemic but the Hampton Inn made us feel comfortable and safe. We were able to check in early and check out late they also held our luggage since we had a late flight. You can also communicate with the front desk through text which I found so convenient & easy. They also offer complimentary toiletries you might of forgotten. No hot breakfast is being offered at the moment which we understand it's for everyone's safety| but they do offer breakfast to go bags which included fruit | granola bar| muffin or bread and some water which was perfect for us since there is no charge for it. Parking is not advertised as free there is a fee which can be a little pricey it was around $40-$45 a night. There is a $60 dollar deposit hold for each night you stay but was placed back into my account in minutes after checking out. Please do your reach when booking for any extra fees before being upset over charges if you have questions call the hotel. Over all my trip was amazing and I will definitely be booking my stay here again!,1
Hotel was clean. Expected a bath tub and not a just a shower but not a deal breaker. Room is not big but high ceilings and long windows and curtains made it seem spacious| especially with curtains open.  Great location| decent Italian restaurant down the street| McDonald's| and a few more. Stayed during covid 19 pandemic so lots of places are closed| ex. Restaurant right across the street. Staycation was great and staying at this hotel added to the relaxing weekend.,1
Nice hotel Terrible breakfast No microwave to heat food or cook oatmeal,1
Everything was great about the hotel. Nice |clean and friendly.,1
The continental breakfast turned out to be a brown bag. During this time you have to maintain your own room. Overall the staff was friendly and helpful.,1
I thought parking was attached to building so that was disappointing having to walk from parking garage to hotel after a long day. The staff was friendly even though the receptionist was obviously very swamped. He stayed calm and collected the entire time and explained everything well. Kudos to him! The room was very clean even though they were also rushing to have available clean rooms for the guests. You could definitely tell they were short staffed.,1
Check-in too late| we had to wait for the room to get cleaned until 7 pm. The breakfast was terrible| a mini banana| a bottled water and a snack. This is the second time it happens at Hampton in. Not happy at all.,0
Although our stay was for only one night| it was extremely pleasant and accommodating. They were effective and efficient under the new guidelines and I could tell that they spared no expense with the cleanliness of their property. The bed was UBER comfortable,1
Uneventful one night stay. Nothing to complain about. Friendly front desk,1
This was the worst stay of our lives. We went to Chicago for valentines day weekend. This hotel does not have parking and the closest parking garage is three blocks away so if you're like me and can barely walk or move around this is very difficult. The price to valet is very expensive and it is not for the entire stay like we were told. It is per night. The comfort was awful and when we stayed I tried to use the blow dryer in the bathroom| when I turned it on It sparked and started smoking in my ands. luckly I didn't receive any injury sense I use my hands for work. When I told the lobby about the incident they sent up a dryer from housekeeping that smelt like burnt hair. I ended up having to use the plug in the room instead of the bathroom because the plug in the bathroom no longer worked. This is not a good place to stay if you are low on money. The only exception is that it is close to everything and the breakfast is different from other blahblah hotels.,0
Rooms were quiet. Rooms were very clean. We were there 3 days and encountered many staff members and they were ALL very helpful down from the breakfast servers to the housekeeping to the reservation counter. There was a WONDERFUL selection for breakfast each morning. It was hot and fresh AND different each day!,1
Friendly staff| great breakfast| comfy room. It was in a good location for what we wanted to do and I didnt have to look at a Trump hotel marquee.  Stayed in room 708. The bathroom floor door stop was broken off. There was a rather sharp edge on it. I told the desk clerk about it.,1
It was the only property that didn't have any staff to check in you at 12am. I have never experienced that in my life. Doors locked and no way to get inside I had to buy another room at a different hotel that night.,0
Great distance from everything needed. Wonderful steak house across the street..,1
Excellent location and clean| comfortable room. Loved the cookies! Wish the hotel would invest in sustainable plates| cups and utensils for breakfast. It is time for hotels to stop investing in single-use items such as these| in the age of climate change.,1
This was our family holiday 'experience'| seeing Hamilton and staying at the Majestic. If you are seeing a show at the CBIC| stay at this hotel because you get amazing theater access. Our 2 Queen room was lovely - however| at the last minute one of my young adult daughters ended up not coming and I took my best friend along in her place| with one young adult daughter and my preteen son. I looked for a larger room to upgrade but didn't find anything. I did see an option to add a rollaway bed and figured that would at least give them some personal sleeping space. Unfortunately| the Hampton will NOT allow a rollaway if the room has 2 beds. I understand the premise but also found it very difficult. My young adult daughter opted for the floor| which I hated for a family experience in a beautiful (and expensive) hotel. I have to say that Porshce| at the front desk| was kind and welcoming and wanted to help us - she sent extra bedding and drinks - but my daughter still slept on the floor over this policy. Please give your very fine employees the discretion to act in accordance with common sense. We weren't trying to take advantage of the hotel| we were trying to make a once-in-a-lifetime experience comfortable for all of us.,1
Enjoyed the free breakfast| along with the regular items they included freshly made smoothies| pressed juice and chocolate waffles.,1
Nice big rooms and bathroom.  Located right next to CIBC Theater.  Breakfast also was very good.,1
We liked that breakfast was included with the room with a variety of options to choose from.,1
Assigned king bed room was not wheelchair accessible as chosen on Expedia app| but staff provided another room that did have an accessible bathroom but with a queen bed however.,1
We enjoyed everything from the pleasant check in| Porsche was very helpful and friendly| to the assistance by the other staff.Great hotel!,1
Great location.  Room was nice and clean.,1
15 min walk to Union Station. 1/2 mile to Millennial Park/ Cloud gate. 1/2 mile to Macy's Xmas Windows Staff very friendly. Great Breakfast. Comfortable beds.,1
Hampton's are so consistent which makes you feel comfortable off the bat. Then Oscar at the front desk blew me away when he mailed my postcard and told me to take my time when I was late checking out and he had to refresh my key card!! So friendly and helpful!!,1
Such a wonderful experience.  The staff was extremely helpful and very friendly.  Love the location of the hotel very convenient to restaurants and shows,1
This property was very nice. Walking distance to shopping (not mag. mile) Lots of restaurants close also. The staff was amazing. With that being said| there was an incident that might concern some. I felt our safety was at risk when Chicago police were called do to an issue with the room next to mine. Loud m,1
This hotel has friendly staff and the location is perfect!,1
The front desk texted me regarding any special requests for our stay before we even left home!  The service was very attentive.  Valet parking was convenient.The hotel was conveniently located to everything we wanted to see and do during our stay.,1
Breakfast selection was great and so was the fruit/hot beverages available 24/7. However| the window in our room was too high to see out of| so we could not look outside.,1
We loved staying at the Hampton Majestic.  It was a perfect location so we could walk to all the things we wanted to see.,1
The hotel was great and the breakfast had stuff I could actually eat with all my food allergies.,1
It was great to be next door to the theatre where we saw Hamilton!,1
Great and clean room. Awesome location within chicago downtown. Along shopping area| parks and alot of food options,1
Close to downtown Chicago.  Nice breakfast....Convenient to shopping,1
Had a king size bed. The sheets were too small had to have them put on the correct ones. The breakfast for day 2 had no meat unusual,1
The staff was very friendly and accomodating. They had the best free breakfast that I have ever seen. I loved the big windows in the guest rooms.,1
We missed our connecting flight and needed a room just for the night. We got there late and we very tired. The front desk clerk was very nice| telling us what was available to eat and when. I noticed they had a few snacks and amenities on display but didn't see the much desired toothbrush and toothpaste set. She noticed I was peering at the display and asked what I was looking for so I told her. She went in the back and came out with two toothbrushes and two toothpaste packets. She then gave us two water bottles and a whole bunch of snacks. I don't know if this is standard but it was very much appreciated. It made the unexpected delay a little better!,1
Walking distance to so many great sites.  Easy metro ride from airport.,1
A lovely hotel very conveniently connected to the CIBC theater. Room very comfortable. Wondered if the bathroom floor had been washed. Plus no gluten free bread items for breakfast. Otherwise would've given it a top rating.,1
Better than average free breakfast.  GREAT location in theatre district| esp. if you are seeing Hamilton next door!,1
Very nice and clean| will stay here again| good location,1
The day time Bell Hop was excellent| but the evening gentlemen barely looked up from his desk and did not speak very good English.  Otherwise| great location| good service and clean hotel room.,1
Good location. Easy access to CIBC theater.  Nice helpful staff. Free bottles of water.,1
Convenience to downtown venues and ability to walk places easily,1
The hotel is a great choice if you are headed to the Majestic theater as you won't find anything closer.  Room was clean| but small| typical of many in Chicago.  Bellman extremely helpful.  We really missed not having a restaurant or bar in the hotel.  There were also no glasses other than styrofoam cups in the room.  Hotel was a quick walk from Union Station.,1
Clean| friendly front desk staff| in a great central location. Really enjoyed our stay here.,1
The staff was amazing and the location of the property was very near to skydeck and millennium Park.,1
The valet people were nice| but the valet fee was expensive.,1
The location is convenient- walking  distance to some attractions and along bus and metro lines. Staff was friendly and helpful. Good breakfast offerings. Only drawback was thin pillows.,1
This is the best hotel I've stayed at in a long| long time! From start to finish| it was a terrific experience.,1
From the minute you walk into the property the staff is phenomenal!! Very friendly and helpful. We were in Chicago to see Hamilton and the convenience was superb. Beds are very comfortable and rooms clean. Will definitely stay here again.,1
This hotel was in a perfect location within walking distance to everything we wants to do downtown. The complimentary breakfast was top notch. This is an older building and there's not much of a lobby. Outside of that it was a great place to stay and we will be back!,1
The staff were friendly and very helpful.  ALL staff!  The location is within walking distance to everything!  The fact that we got right into the theater was wonderful| too!  Highly recommend!  We will always stay here on our visits to Chicago!,1
Staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were a bit dark.,1
Accessible to all and very nice staff. Clean facility| responsive staff,1
Fantastic location especially to attend an evening performance of Hamilton. Great hotel & accommodations. Would stay again.,1
Wonderful hotel! Staff members were friendly and helpful| and our room was clean and nicely decorated.,1
Close to everything we wanted to see...Art Institute| Water Tower| etc. Staff was so nice| gave us a card and a gift for our anniversary.  Breakfast was good| plenty to eat.,1
Great location for Hamilton theatergoers! It was raining when we left the performance and it was nice to have indoor access back to the hotel. Very friendly staff. Also appreciated how quiet the room was at night.,1
We wnnt to Chicago to see Hamilton. This hotel was the same bldg as the theatre. We didn't even have to take our coats!,1
Great location. Great staff. Great rooms.,1
The staff were so polite I don't think I've ever stayed at a hotel with such polite staff before.,1
We arrived in Chicago on early flight| took train into loop| had breakfast at iconic spot and took the grandgirls up to the top of Willis Tower to arrive at hotel before noon. We were given a spot to wait and refreshments while waiting for an early check-in. At the time of our matinee of Hamilton we were shown through an interior door to the lobby of the theater (avoiding the line outside). The room was very comfortable and very clean. The staff was very helpful. Overall this was a great stay!,1
Location is perfect especially if you're going to see a play at CIBC Theater. The  staff is friendly.,1
Everyone was very friendly. The breakfast exceeded our expectations| and the convenience of being next to the CIBC theatre was fantastic. I will definitely stay here again. The only downside was continually waiting for the elevators.,1
Nice. Grest value. Included breakfast was really good.,1
loved the helpful friendly staff| loved it all! room just great,1
Excellent location - literally seconds from the CIBC and within a few minutes walk of the CTA Adams Wabash stop| Chicago Art Institute| Pritzker Military Museum| and a little further along Michigan Ave. is the Chicago Architecture Museum.  Also| there are many different places to eat in the neighborhood.,1
Very clean hotel with cheerful| helpful staff. When we got to our room| the smoke detector was beeping. They sent a maintenance man right away and when he wasn't sure how long it might take| they immediately moved us to another room. Good breakfast with lots of choices. Went from lobby at Hampton directly in to the lobby of the cibc theatre. I highly re o.mend.this hotel.,1
Room was quiet.  Hot breakfast was good and filling.  Walked to the theater from the inside and left coats in the hotel room.,1
Great Breakfast| Friendly Staff| Great Location,1
Loved being attached to the theater and right across the street from a nice restaurant.,1
The hotel had a connecting door to the theater and they kept our luggage and coats safe for free at the Valet. We went through the connecting door it was wonderful!!!,1
Overall| we were pleased with our stay.  The location was great.  There were two items that we didn't find to be ideal.  First| the mattresses were not as comfortable as a typical Hampton.  Also| the breakfast was heavy on pastries| fruit| and cereals.  I have stayed a Hampton Inn many times and they typically have at least a breakfast meat to hot with eggs and toast.,1
We went to Chicago to see Hamilton. This hotel is above the theater. Perfect! So convenient to just take the elevator to the show. Everyone else is waiting outside in the cold. The only complaint I have is the sheets were too small for the bed. I wrestled with the sheets and the slippery comforter all night. It kept sliding off the bed. Annoying! All else was great.,1
Ideally located adjacent State Street providing spacious| clean and well appointed bedrooms and excellent complimentary breakfast. The staff were all friendly and helpful and contributed towards our first and memorable stay in Chicago.,1
The valet guys were outstanding. Helped us out with explaining parking and got us into Hamilton at the CIBC theatre without having to go outside or wait in line. Very friendly. The front desk was very pleasant. Also had a very good hot breakfast. We pulled up in our car and the valet were there right away to get us all set. You have to pay $60.00 per day for parking but you have valet access to your car 24/7 as much as you need so decided that was a bargain for us.,1
The staff were fabulous! Very pleasant and caring.,1
The Hampton Inn Chicago Theater District was perfect for an overnight in Chicago with my daughter| primarily to see Hamilton. The price of $119| which includes breakfast was on budget. I skipped the valet parking ($56: although the valets were great| always with a friendly smile and hello) and opted to park just a few blocks away under Millennium Park for only $22! You need to PREPAY ONLINE and then scan the barcode (from your phone) when you leave the garage. The staff at the Hampton Inn were great! It is connected to the theater box office so we were able to easily pick up our tickets| walk back up to our room| get ready for dinner| walk less than 2 blocks to Italian Village for dinner and finally to Hamilton. We left our coats in our room because we didn't even need to walk outside to enter the theater!,1
Valet parking was a plus and they were completely friendly and helpful. Desk staff always polite and professional.,1
great area staff was awesome,1
Soooo convenient when coming to see Hamilton. Very friendly staff.,1
We stayed here while visiting to see Hamilton. It is so convenient being that it is attached to the theatre. I read previous reviews that staff wasn't pleasant| but thay wasn't our experience at all. Everyone worker was helpful and welcoming. The breakfast was nice to have which was hard to find with hotels downtown. The location is also great for shopping| or needing items that you forgot-target and cvs is like 3 minutes from hotel. Its also a nice hotel if you're traveling with children. I will definitely stay here again.,1
The hotel was located next to the theater where Hamilton was playing.  We were able to walk downstairs and go into the theater without exiting the building.  Additionally| the bellman escorted us through and we were seated within minutes!,1
Beautiful hotel| conveniently located next door to the CIBC Theater and just a few minutes walk to shopping| restaurants| Millennium Park| etc. The beds were extremely comfortable and our two-queen room was very roomy! We would absolutely stay here again.,1
"Our stay at the Majestic was amazing! We were close to everything we needed and wanted to do. The ""L"" train stop from O'Hare airport is literally around the corner so we could just take it in and walk to our hotel room without the trouble of renting a car or calling a cab. It is also immediately adjacent to the CIBC theater where we saw Hamilton and it was an incredible experience being so close! We even got to see the actors come out after the show as we were going to dinner. Highly recommend the Majestic and I'm planning on staying again someday!",1
Saw Hamilton next door. Easy location to get to. Will be back again. 2 nd trip here in 6 mo,1
This is in the center of City and near to all visiting places. Nice and tasty break fast. We have to pay for parking of vehicle| hotel has valet parking staff.,1
It was a great place. The people were really lovely and so helpful. Having our own entrance to the theatre was just such a wonderful surprise.,1
Great location.  free breakfast.  free wi-fi. close to restaurants and shops.,1
Beautiful historic hotel steps away from the Majestic Theater in downtown Chicago make this Hampton Inn both unique and comfortable. The location cannot be beat in the middle of the theater district and easy walking to Magnificent Mile| museums| Navy Pier| and Lake Michigan.  Valet parking is easy with good service and the free buffet breakfast is a find in a downtown hotel!,1
ItWas a wonderfulVisit. Caring staff and perfect location,1
I loved that it was right in the middle of everything üëå,1
A nice clean older property| centrally located| all staff were very nice & helpful.,1
Great location| great breakfast| the room was clean and the refrigerator was nice to have in our room.  We were allowed to use the microwave to heat up our left over pizza. We will be making this trip again and definitely will stay here!,1
The location the State Street is excellent. Easy walk to Michigan Ave.,1
We experience only a high level of customer.er sevice. The valet A dorm (sp?) Was extremely accommodating. The rooms we spacious with a beautiful view. Brrakfast was delicious and we had several items to select from. This hotel is close to everything. We would stay again. And highly recommend.,1
Excellent location| clean spacious room| great staff.,1
This is hooked to CIBC Theater where Hamilton is playing!!  We were able to run to our room at intermission to use the restroom!  So awesome.,1
Such a wonderful staff. Willing to go extra mile to make sure our stay was PERFECT!!! Location was Perfect!!!  Valet staff was fabulous!!! I have nothing bad to say about this hotel or any of the staff!!!!,1
Great service.,1
Needs a mini bar,1
Staff at the lobby check in desk was delightful| Autumn at check in and later in the evening| and a young man at check out whose name I regret I did not get.,1
Historical significance of the building.  Decor and comfortable bed.  The breakfast was good| and we appreciate the robust coffee.,1
Great location| close to everything. Staff very friendly,1
Great hotel!  Lots of amenities!  Nice pool.  We had dinner in the sports bar.  Staff was excellent.  Food and drinks were good.  Complimentary breakfast was outstanding.  Lots of choices.  Room was clean and quiet. Bed was comfortable.  Would definitely stay here again if in the area.,1
It was really convenient to be here if attending a show at CIBC theatre.   We were in town to see Hamilton and it was great staying here,1
"Loved the fact that we were able to get to the ""Front of the Line"" for the play next door :-)",1
Great location in the heart of the theater district| this hotel is within easy walking distance to Lake Michigan and all it has to offer. If you don't want to walk| you can hop on a Bird Bike. There is a hub within a block. There is plenty of shopping nearby and lots of choices in restaurants. Right next to CIBC Theater where we saw Hamilton. Free breakfast is a great perk| and hotel staff was very friendly. Maid service was excellent.,1
If you are constantly on the go and not looking to stay in the hotel for very long periods of time| this hotel will be fine for your needs.  It definitely has that old style feel with updated rooms for the times.  For a king size bed room| it was too small to spend your vacation doing few things.  But it is Chicago so you probably do have a lot of things to do and so this type of hotel room will be fine.  The staff there is very nice though for the front desk and concierge services.,1
Friendly staff. Very close to the blue and red line CTA train. Very convenient.,1
We were only in town for less than 24 hours. We had been given last minute tickets to Hamilton. I had never been to Chicago before. The hotel and the theater are in the same building! It is also located within safe and easy walking distance from the lake and Grant and Millenium Park.  Easily got to see cool sites as well as an amazing show.  Staff was superb|  and I can't shout out to the bell staff enough. Those guys were the BEST!!!!! Breakfast was average| not a free meal always helps the budget even on a short trip!,1
great hotel| great location!,1
Very family friendly hotel. Breakfast  is good and very courteous staff,1
Totally the most convenient hotel for Hamilton. CIBC Theatre is in the same building. Hamilton is awesome!!,1
I had good experience with this hotel and would definitely recommend to all. Location was perfect. They let us in before the check in time since the room was ready.,1
Not worth for money spend.,0
Right in the heart of the loop. Walking distance to many attractions! Very close to subway lines (blue and red).,1
the only downside to this hotel is the parking but that is typical for downtown Chicago.,1
Valet guy was terrific! Friendly| funny| accommodating. Unable to check until 4...room not ready  Valet will hold bags after checkout. Room was great! Not large but comfy..good bed| clean| shower that'll almost knock you to the floor. Comp breakfast is ok..standard Hampton stuff.  Hotel is attached to the theater where Hamilton is playing| but curiously not noisy. And lobby is on 4th floor..must have room key to access higher floors. Within walking distance of a LOT.  Good choice!,1
It was a weekend get away and a beautiful time it was!,1
Excellent customer service - clean| comfortable and we will come again.,1
BUSINESS facility could have been bigger although the desktop and printer worked fine. Breakfast area a bit cramped. Price and location were perfect.,1
Love everything about this hotel.  Especially it is right next door to the Hamilton theater. The special line for hotel guests is a fantastic idea.   Service from the check in counter and bell is very friendly.  Excellent walking distance to many theaters and attractions.  Although you need more rollaway beds.  We have requested a rollaway bed upon reservation| at arrival in the morning| at checking in late afternoon| and the next morning.  None were available.  Overall| a fantastic hotel.,1
Nice hotel within walking distance of many of the cities sites. If you are driving in investigate your parking options. Valet at the hotel maybe your best option.,1
Perfect location for the Hamilton performance at the CIBC Theatre next door. Also a great location from the train station for walking  to the hotel.,1
Arrived on the train and never thought our room would be available but it was! Convenient location!,1
Angel at the reservation desk was amazing. Gave us dining tips and directions. Beds were very comfortable and room was clean. The only thing not up to par was the shower surround. The ‚Äúpaint‚Äù was peeling in big flakes.,1
Good location| very nice staff and clean comfortable rooms.  Included breakfast was decent.  Loved the all day coffee and fruit.  Only issue was the small and slow elevators.  Plan to wait.,1
Historic hotel - extremely quiet rooms| great housekeeping.,1
Great hotel! Perfect location for seeing Hamilton.,1
Nice property. No complaints. Way better than average breakfast.,1
Can't beat the proximity to the theater! Excellent breakfast options as well.  Hope to return soon!,1
Room was very clean and modern. Bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept on. The front desk staff was extremely friendly. I expected a small somewhat dingy hotel because that's what I usually find in the loop but this really exceeded my expectations. I would definitely stay here again.  Use an app and park for $15 for 24 hours in a garage  a half a block away. Worth it.,1
Decent hotel. Clean| no noise| and a VERY short walk to and from Hamilton!,1
Great and friendly staff.  Clean and modern.  Historic building| great location and price!,1
Very nice restored hotel. Nice to stay at and easy to access theatre. Valet service was another Strong plus for us as we are not that familiar with downtown Chicago.,1
Perfect location. Very easy to get to. Subway station at both corners. Walking Distance to everything downtown. Great breakfast. Super staff. Clean room. Only negative was mattress too firm and sheets to small for two people.,1
The location is great. Walking distance to anything in Chicago. Bed was fine. Breakfast was fairly standard. My only complaint is that there was a hair on the bar of soap in the box next to the bathroom sink. I'm guessing the bar was added back to the box after the previous guest left. Definitely made me question the cleanliness of everything else in the room.,1
Great location for theatre,1
Friendly| secure| clean| quiet| great food| attentive staff| and we will stay here again next time we visit Chicago!,1
Check-in clerk said I could charge to card used to make reservation even though I didn't have it. Check out clerk| different person said I had to use the one I swiped for incidentals. Don't appreciate when I'm told two different things!,1
Best place for cibc theater!!,1
It was -10 with the windchill on the day we went to see Hamilton. The connected lobby allowed us to get to our seats quickly without standing in line outside. The breakfast nook is small| so plan to wait in line.,1
Great Staff!,1
Easy access to anywhere in the loop or cross to the riverside. The subways are near by and all the main loop attractions. Comfortable bed and complimentary breakfast. Nice staff and safe place to stay.,1
Jnelli (sp?) helped us with our check in and accommodated our request to have rooms on the same floor.  The scent of fresh-baked cookies greeted us as we entered the lobby.  Each staff member we encountered was helpful and courteous.  The rooms were suprisingly large considering it is a botique hotel.  The beds were comfortable and the shower was lovely.  The small size of the hotel was perfect for being comfortable with letting our teens explore and hang out.  Since the hotel is connected to the theater where Hamilton was playing| it was nice to not have to wait outside in the cold - and our teens said that it was nice to be able to jump over to the hotel to use the restrooms during intermission instead of waiting in the long lines at the theater.  The breakfast was top notch: scrambled eggs| sausage| oatmeal| fruit| waffles| muffins| bagels| etc. with a nice selection of juices| coffee| teas; and the staff members who oversaw breakfast were helpful and took pride in what they offered.  The hotel had free Wi-Fi as well. Parking was my only challenge as the hotel had none| however| through ParkWhiz| we were able to book a 24 hour spot under the Palmer Hotel which was a short walk away - very convenient.  There is no pool at the hotel| but honestly| we don't stay in Chicago to swim! Millenium Park was three blocks away.  Several good restaurants were in close walking distancd too. We would stay at the hotel again.,1
The staff really went out of their way to solve issues for me. The location could not be better for theatre| the Christkindlmarket| the Art Institute and all the Xmas sights in the Loop.,1
Comfy| clean| great location| good breakfast| friendly employees.  Very convenient to everything.  Good water pressure in the shower| too.  Couldn't ask for more!,1
Great stay. Great location..,1
"Came to see ""Hamilton"" so it could not have been any more convenient.  Door man went out of his way to make us feel very welcome.  Breakfast was good.",1
Great experience! Very helpful and friendly staff.,1
Loved it,1
Not only is the location of the Hampton Inn Majestic PERFECT for any theatre-goer or Chicago-meanderer|  but the staff is delightful| the beds are clean and comfy| and the breakfast is included!  It was such a delightful stay that we will be back again and again.  Thank you for a wonderful experience!,1
Everything about the hotel was nice except the elevator situation.  It can be a long wait when busy.,1
We stayed night to see the Thanksgiving Day  Parade. It was very nice inside with a large room for 3 people. The room was clean and comfortable. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good and there was lots to choose from even though the hotel was full. Liked the security and convenience of valet parking. Very happy with our choice.,1
The location was great! Staff was friendly| and they also have simple breakfast in the morning.,1
Nicely maintained older hotel. Location was ideal location within walking distance to State St. Shopping| theaters| good restaurants and bars| the Art Institute| the bean| miracle mile shopping and museum campus. Staff was very friendly| free breakfast had a variety of nice options each day and they had free wifi so we felt the value was outstanding. Would definatrly stay here again when we return to Chicago!,1
Everything was great. Love the full hot breakfast. Front desk staff was wonderful| especially Yaneli.,1
Awesome location!!!  The room was big for an urban hotel| and the breakfast and other treats (afternoon cookies!) were super. Nice staff and an easy walk to shopping| parks| architecture tour| etc.  Most convenient urban hotel!,1
We made our reservation for this trip in April. As we arrived at the airport and were getting settled in our rental car| we received a call from the hotel telling us they were overbooked and we were being moved to their sister location 20 mins. away. The hotel was in a very sketchy part of town. There was NO WAY we would have booked at this property on our own. Local public transit across the street ran every 10 mins. all night and we even heard gunshots in the wee hours of the morning. I would not take a chance with this hotel when the opportunity to move you is totally at their disposal.,0
Nice hotel in theatre district. Easy access to theatres| Millennial Park|stock exchange| federal buildings. Room was comfortable. It was clean but not pristine. Breakfast was good and was different on the 2 days I stayed. Fresh fruit| cookies| coffee| tea and ice water were always available. Valet parking was ridiculously expensive but there are many car rental agencies around and the red and blue lines are both easy walking distance. I would stay here again. Only downside is that there is no pool and it was terribly hit and muggy when we stayed.,1
Had a great time!!!,1
Amazing experience. Great location. In center of downtown. Close to major attractions like Willis tower | 2blocks away from millenium park.Friendly staff. Parking available nearby(not in hotel).Overall excellent experience.,1
Would recommend this hotel.,1
Very nice place to stay| close to most of the attractions| the train and busses.,1
Great place to stay and the staff is great! Hotel is located close to Millennium park and walking distance to a lot of attractions.,1
We had a great experience at this hotel! This trip was our first to Chicago and this hotel was right at the center of everywhere we wanted to visit! The hotel is also in the same building as the Private Bank Theater| so if you are planning to see a show| staying at the Hampton gives  you direct access to the theater! I would highly recommend this hotel!,1
We were surprising my granddaughter with tickets to the musical Hamilton and being at the hotel connected to the theater was an added bonus in addition to the hotel itself having everything you would expect from a Hilton Hotel.,1
We really enjoyed our stay. It is in a great location to a lot of attractions in downtown Chicago. We parked the car on arrival and walked everywhere we had planned to go. We loved being next to the private bank theater to see Hamilton. Free breakfast was pretty good. The only complaint was that the bed was super hard.,1
We enjoyed our stay.  Great location to the theatre district and south Michigan Avenue.   Breakfast area is very small and trouble finding seat to eat.  Food was good though.,1
Very Nice People.,1
Historic Building with an extraordinary touch. I enjoyed everything about my stay and will stay again.,1
Hotel was clean. Staff was friendly and helpful. Breakfast was delicious. Location is amazing.,1
Great location and excellent staff.  The breakfast was very good.,1
What a great location.  Extra nice accessible room for handicapped.,1
Great value for the money. The staff is excellent| always ready to help out!! The amenities are overall condition are fine| not fancy| but they are adequate. I do like the historic building| modern decor and high ceilings! I wasn't a fan of the breakfast| but coffee and fruit are good to grab.,1
Central loop location| perfect for all downtown activities|,1
My daughter and I stayed here after attending a theatre performance next door.  The hotel was small and a little outdated| but it was clean and comfortable.  The hotel was very quiet which was a plus.  The breakfast buffet offered a good variety.  The staff accommodated my request to stay just a little past the checkout time.,1
"When we knew we were going to take in ""Hamilton"" we decided to stay in the city overnight. We searched the hotels| and by chance found the Hampton Inn Majestic. While we could have found a less expensive hotel| why bother? We didn't even have to bring our coats| as the Hampton is right off the the theater's lobby. At the final curtain| all the rest of the audience was scrambling for their coats and to get to their parking garages| we just strolled back to our rooms. What a pleasure!",1
The location cannot be beat| especially for those of you seeing Hamilton!! Enjoy Chicago's theater district| shopping| and attractions from this great hotel.,1
The service (aside from Angel) was not that good. The staff wasn't that friendly within the hotel. The breakfast area is very tiny and the seats do not accommodate the amount of people/rooms they have. They only provided bagels with poppy seeds the second day. One of the beds in our room was lumpy and hard. The bellmen were fast and courteous.,1
Check in staff very helpful and friendly. Good selection for breakfast.,1
Great stay! Great hotel and staff!! Location is perfect!,1
Great front staff | literally next to Private Bank theater | was able to go right around the corner to stage door for signatures .,1
Our room was smallish but sufficient. Would have liked a refrigerator and microwave but ice was directly across the hall.,1
Very nice friendly staff. Great location in the theatre district. Nice clean room.,1
Fantastic venue and proximity to Theater| Restaurants and Shopping.,1
Went to Hamilton| great show| nice to stay next door. Room cheap| parking expensive,1
The morning breakfast far exceeded our expectations for a continental - the doormen were especially happy and wonderful.  Great location!,1
We went to see Hamilton right next door to hotel.  Was perfect.  Also in walking distance to park and shopping.  Room was comfortable and very quiet.,1
We were watching a musical right next door at the Private Bank Theater so being right next door was super convenient. The hotel was in great condition and close to the attractions we wanted to see. It was also close to State street which has many different shops. I would definetly stay here again.,1
This is a nice moderately priced hotel| especially if one of your reasons to come to Chicago is to see Hamilton which is right next door.  The hotel is also within three blocks of the EL.  The staff is very courteous and professional.  The breakfast buffet is quite good with always nice options of hot food| waffles| fruit| and the usual cereal and muffin offerings.   Tea and Coffee are available throughout the day.  Again| this is nothing fancy--no elaborate facilities| restaurant (there are options nearby)| pool| etc.  But it worked perfectly for my needs.,1
Very nice hotel. Stuff are very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is delicious. And the most important thing is that this hotel is close to almost every attractions. Very recommended.,1
This hotel is perfect if attending a show at the Private Bank Theater.   Clean| comfortable| affordable.,1
We had a wonderful stay!  Great location| very friendly staff and the free hot breakfast was very nice! Even the sofa bed was comfortable. Will definitely stay here the next trip to Chicago!!,1
The breakfast both mornings was good.  The eggs were well cooked| and the sausage gravy was actually very good.  Pleasantly surprised.,1
Stay was excellent. Staff was pleasant and helpful. Breakfast was good with nice selection.,1
Excellent location for an evening at the theater.  Inside access in the winter was a plus,1
This hotel was great!! I booked it because of is proximity to the theatre since I was in town to see Hamilton. Great staff and great room. If you're in town for Hamilton definitely check this out,1
Breakfast was great! Room was ok. Bedding needs updating. Proximity to theatre was great.,1
Went to see Hamilton| and it was right next to the theater. Great location for shopping and museums| too.,1
Room in same building as old Majestic theater| very nice| large clean and quiet.  Complimentary breakfast was decent.  Wish parking was cheaper| but that's downtown Chicago for you.  Highly recommend for theater performances.,1
Entry to Majestic Bank theater was very convenient,1
We were there to see Hamilton so the location could not have been better!,1
If you are going to see a show at the Private Bank Theater (like Hamilton) stay here. It's in the same building and we got from our balcony seats back to our room in under 5 minutes| without stepping out into the cold.,1
All good but bed was uncomfortable.,1
We enjoyed the close proximity to everything that this hotel provides.  The age of the building gives it both character and interest.  There isn't really a drawback to staying here if you aren't expecting extravagance. It was clean| safe and friendly for our family.,1
We had a great time at the hotel!  Great location and the staff was very friendly!,1
Wonderful hotel| conveniently located to the PrivateBank Theatre. Decent breakfast| kind staff.,1
Very good location| comfortable and quiet room with reasonable breakfast,1
Location was ideal in terms of proximity to attractions like Millennium Park and the riverwalk.,1
Room was incredibly clean and comfortable. Staff was friendly and attentive. Great experience!,1
Very clean| well maintained property. Professional| attentive staff. They only offer valet parking but are very timely when you need your vehicle.  Great location| just 1 block to the Riverwalk and walking distance to excellent restaurants and shopping. We drove to the beach| navy pier area and paid for parking (keep that in mind wherever you drive)!,1
The Hampton Inn is close to UIUC engineering department| slightly far to the main dinning restaurant area| about 10-15 minutes walk| but manageable. Property is clean| plenty parking space. Overall| it is a good location to stay in UIUC.,1
Breakfast would have been a nice extra to include,1
Only thing I liked Hotel is walkable to most of the attractions and remaining things are horrible like Valet parking is so costly it's $69 per night. Room is not good for the price. They are giving  connecting rooms and our room is so smelly due to the other connecting room persons are smoking so beware of that. No free breakfast.,0
One night stay. Good location 8/10,1
Excellent and friendly staff and service,1
Highly recommended that any person visiting Chicago stay at this location. It's close to so many attractions and conveniently located.,1
Great stay! Excellent location. Some of the front desk staff were not the friendliest (no acknowledgement you were coming/going) but that didn't bother us. Rooms were a bit on the smaller side but beds were comfy and view was great. Would recommend!,1
Most noticeable was the lack of a welcoming| comfortable lobby. That being said| the front desk staff was very helpful and friendly and our rooms were clean and up-to-date. Most positive note is the great location so close to Chicago's fun River Front!,1
Holy| one of hotel receptionist. She helped my mother to find an Uber because my mother didn't know how to do it. She went out with her and wait until she saw my mother was in the right car. Thank you!! We need more people like Holy. I would definitely recommended this hotel. Thank you Holy!,1
The lady at the front desk was AMAZING| I totally forgot to snag her name but she helped me and my boyfriend out from a day from hell while being on our anniversary trip. Everything that could go wrong did and when we finally got to the hotel all of our cards declined (due to traveling our banks flagged us) and she didn't let that stop us| she knew her job perfectly and finally our cards went through. It was a pivotal point in our day and she absolutely made our night 100000000x better will definitely stay here each time we're in Chicago| perfect location and can walk to any of your favorite stores. Plus it's affordable!,1
Close to everything!,1
Close proximity to everything,1
Location is great and the staff are friendly and helpful,1
The view was awful- the back of a building.  The 2 bottles of water complimentary was nice.,1
Location  was great Perfect for a business trip,1
The hotel is located so close to the river walk and not far from navy pier. Front desk was AMAZING! Our flight came in early and they held our bags for us and called to let us know our room was ready earlier than expected.  They took the time to ask us how things were going every time we left hotel or arrived. Room was very clean and well stocked. We were only there for a night but felt a true relationship with the employees as they were soooo friendly and constantly made sure we had what we needed and that we were enjoying our stay not only in the hotel but in Chicago. I will definitely book there next time we are in the Chicago area!,1
The condition of the property was somewhat tired.  Carpets in room and hallway worn.  Sparse and old furniture.  Small lobby.  Meager pantry substitute for restaurant being closed.   It was clean however.,1
Wonderful staff that's always helpful and courteous. Location of hotel is perfect! You're next to the river and shopping. Will definitely be staying there again!,1
C,1
We stayed in room 808| immediately after we arrived I called down to ask about ANY other  room with any view besides alley-like area and men working| I was told there was nothing on all 25  floors‚Ä¶ the room smelled musty when the air was at a comfortable 70-72| when air was running between 68-69 it was freezing but didn't smell as bad. The bathroom had a horrible high pitched ringing sound constantly‚Ä¶ may have been pipes. No breakfast served.. only grab and go| staff was good not overly helpful. Overall it was fine. Won't stay there again.,0
It was close to the office.,1
The staff were very kind!,1
Front desk staff was so friendly! Fast elevators. Great Room!,1
Excellent service| very clean and fast elevators.  Having to park offsite is not ideal| but the staff was very helpful with that.,1
It was fine. We thought the bed was uncomfortable but that ms opinion based,1
The only con was parking,1
It was rad,1
The property is central to almost everything. That made planning a bit easier. Parking was very expensive and the closest I was able to find was farther than I would have liked and in a not so pleasant area.,1
Despite booking 3 weeks in advance| the front desk had no record of my reservation. As a result check in was quite lengthy| but in the end they honored the hotels.com rate even though they couldn't find my reservation. Hotel room was clean & comfortable. Doors are paper thin though so hallway noise was easily heard. Fortunately the guests were considerate.,1
Nice| clean hotel with comfy beds. The front desk staff| Julia and Jonathan| were both exceptional! Anything I needed or any question I had| they were there to help. Great stay!!!,1
The hotel is in a great location! The staff was phenomenal!! Very friendly and accommodating| especially when we left something in our room after checking out! They went above and beyond!!,1
Great location. Clean and comfortable rooms. Wish there were regular sheets vs only a duvet‚Äî too hot| then cold| then hot. Lack of onsite parking was sort of inconvenient.,1
Check in process was quick and easy. Service was efficient. It was quiet at night!,1
The location is close to attractions and more importantly bus and train stations.  We were able to explore Chicagoland and its neighborhoods as well as the downtown area.  The staff are wonderful.,1
The hotel staff were customer friendly & helped with everything we needed. Very clean. I would recommend this hotel & stay there again.,1
The location was excellent and within walking proximity to many wonderful restaurants and activities in downtown Chicago.  The hotel was very clean| quiet| and comfortable.  Only thing that was disappointing was that there was no hot breakfast available| which is what we had paid extra for.  The entire restaurant area was closed!!!  We did receive $20 in pantry vouchers per day| which was fine| however| we would have much preferred breakfast.,1
Staff was amazing. Room were cleaned upon arrival. Comfortable beds. I will definitely be back and recommend this hotel to others!,1
We stayed here over the 4th of July weekend. I was the absolute perfect location. It was close to everything. Walking distance to restaurants| the river| and all of the activities we had planned. It was the best! I would definitely stay here again.,1
The staff was very nice and the hotel was very clean,1
The property was nice and clean. Overall very pleased. My only issue was that I specifically reserved this hotel for the free breakfast. I was traveling with my 3 children and this was an important factor in choosing a hotel. Paying a little more for this was worth Shortly before,1
We booked over 20 rooms and our stay was amazing!  The GM Kevin was very accomodating and hepful in every way!  I highly recommend this hotel.  It was very clean and had great Staff!,1
The staff was SUPER nice and helpful. The rooms were very comfortable and nice. You didn't feel cramped in the room. Also| the hotel is perfectly located.,1
Excellent beds and linens; Well-organized room. Very nice staff - and props to the housekeeping staff who were always kind while having to share an elevator with guests.,1
Overall this is a nice hotel.  I have stayed here before.  I had a couple of issues.  First of all| you had to schedule to have your room cleaned each day.  Maybe I'm old school| but this should be a given. 2nd| I was charged $25 when I arrived 5 hours before the 4 PM check in.  However| when I checked out 5 hours before the check out time| no one offered me a $25 credit.  Double standard.,1
The best location for everything.  Michigan Ave| River Walk| shopping| theaters awesome restaurants everything right there!,1
Great staff| clean| and great views of the city.,1
This is a very nice hotel. Clean| modern| perfect location.,1
Front desk staff was very helpful with switching our room from handicapped to a room on a higher floor.  They were all very polite| professional and greeted us when we came and went.,1
I was able to check in early with relative ease. The room was smaller than I thought it would be| and my view was an alleyway and the back of a building| but it was the right location and the right price.,1
We had a very good experience.  Concierge was very helpful.  The level of cleanliness exceeded our expectations.  Location excellent as many attractions and restaurants were within walking distance.  We would definitely recommend this hotel to our friends and family.,1
Very helpful staff.,1
The lack of an on-site restaurant was off-putting. The restaurant next door had one| they were slow to react to the return to normalcy,1
The staff was very friendly and helpful. Monica helped with an inquiry that I had regarding parking and check in| and was prompt and knowledgeable.,1
Great location. Short walking distance to must places to visit.,1
Great location. Everyone was very friendly!,1
Quick check in with friendly employees.  Clean room| comfortable bed.  Great location.  10th floor room| really no view except building across the street| but I'm not in Chicago to sit in the room and look out the window.  Will definitely stay here again.,1
Great location and within walking distance of a lot of places of interests.  Room was not serviced one day. That was unacceptable,1
Walkability from ALL of the downtown area!!,1
Location cleanliness  and world standards,1
Great location! Rooms were clean and staff was helpful and friendly.,1
Hotel was in a great location and a bargain for the area|  We were close to the river and several great attractions.  It was walking distance from great restaurant and felt safe even though it was in the middle of the hustle of the city.  The staff was knowledgeable and friendly.,1
The bed was overused and not at all comfortable. Well past due for a new bed! The room itself was nice though and the view of the river was difficult to see for the upgrade. Not worth the cost!,1
No bar or restaurant| but understand. Kept a laundry cart right outside my room at night| some times a trash bag| odd| just think someone was too lazy to put away. Kinda tackyStaff was awesome. Was very clean.,1
It was very clean. Staff was friendly. Excellent location. Will stay again.,1
My experience was fantastic| the staff was great| the room was clean and the hotel was nice and quiet during the night.,1
Nice and quiet. Room didn't have thebest,1
Clean room good location very comfortable bed| can't ask for much more,1
Nice property! Great location| close to river walk. Parking across the street.,1
Plan on finding parking. Also you can hear  street traffic even on higher floors. Hotel is very clean and staff very friendly.,1
Great place to stay. Close to river walk,1
Friendly customer service and a clean| nice environment. My boyfriend and I stayed in a city view room and it was so beautiful.,1
The hotel is in a very nice location| can walk to food| shopping| river walk.My experience was not gr8 as I arrived at 2:30 pm for 4 pm check-in time and was charged $25 extra which surprised me because most hotels will let you check in a little early without any extra charge. On the day of check out I was locked out of my room because the door lock was broke and had to be reprogrammed. No engineer on site and maintenance man needed several tries to unlock my door. I was out for about 45 mins| glad did not miss my flight. Also restaurant onsite is closed right now. So no food in the hotel.,0
Had a fantastic stay. The double queen suite that I reserved was overbooked but the hotel accommodated me with 2 single king suites side by side for the same rate of my reservation.,1
Convenience to public transportation| the riverwalk| museums| dining and millennium park are the main reasons I chose this hotel. And price.  If you are looking for the best bang for your buck the Hilton is a winner.  The only negative I will say is the comfort of the mattresses was subpar comparatively.  After long days of walking| a softer place to plop would have been welcomed.  Choose a RiverFront facing room for the best view.,1
The hotel staff was helpful and very customer friendly. The property was in a good area safe for walking around the city and was very clean. Will definitely stay again,1
The pool was closed the Jacuzzi was closed,0
Liked the location| cleanliness and staff.,1
It's really clean once you come in. Safe environment for sure.,1
I didn't stay there,0
Great location & Affordable !!! Walking distance to many restaurants & shops !!! Great place,1
Location center of downtown close to trains Grand Park River strongly recommend this place to stay if you're in Chicago,1
Not sure if it was due to quarantine or what| but no breakfast service was available. No clean towels or making the bed. Only coffee service was in-room and continually had to call the front desk for Keurig pods.  Otherwise it was very convenient.  The River walk is pretty with lots of restaurants and boat tours. The Navy Pier is a short walk along the River.,1
Great choice staying here; it was close to everything and we were able to walk to most places.  Check in was smooth and quick and so was check out.  Would definitely stay here again.,1
Good location for the things we wanted to do,1
Clean and comfortable.,1
Perfect location. Friendly and helpful stuff. Clean room! We were very satisfied!,1
Location was nice.   Held our bags for the day while we hiked downtown.   Hotel was a bit dated and only 2 elevators.,1
Staff was great| room was clean| location was perfect!,1
Front desk staff was very accommodating. The hotel is in walking distance of everything.,1
Staff was excellent| friendly and helpful. We parked at 60 Lake| Rolls Royce Garage| right around the corner from the hotel. Location was great| right in between major attraction.,1
Nice place in the Heart of Chicago. Excellent value for your money.,1
The staff was very accommodating.   We will be back.,1
We loved the hotel . Parking was a hassle .,1
Very well located everything with in walking distance.,1
Great property.,1
Hotel was in the middle of everything and walking distance to many of Chicago's attractions.,1
Close to riverwalk and the Loop. Everything was within walking distance,1
Main issue: the room doors slam shut super loudly. Holy crap. If your neighbor decides to step out at 2am| you know it.,1
We enjoyed our stay here the staff was so nice and helpful. We will be returning,1
Nice hotel| great location on the magnificent mile| close to riverfront| stores and restaurants. The hotel was clean| room was clean and i felt safe staying there during covid 19.,1
Great location close to major attractions. Would recommend staying.,1
It was comfortable.,1
Great price..Location...Staff was awesome and very accommodating! Parking was close on the street over (Royal Royce Garage) magnificent mile less than a block from hotel!! Definitely will be staying here Again!! Room was smaller than pictured but comfortable!,1
It was a really nice hotel. It was right smack in the middle of downtown. There were so many options of things too do and places too eat within walking distance. I really enjoyed the fact that no one stayed in the room for a full 24 hours before us. We stayed on the 26th floor which was exciting. The view overlooked other buildings. The bed was too soft is really my j ok not complaint.,1
The staff we encountered at each shift was extremely nice.  It's an excellent location| too.,1
Due to Covid we had a hard time finding eating places. The hotel restaurant was closed and one of the reasons we pick the hotel was for their exquisite deep dish pizza. Location was amazing and you can walk everywhere from this point. There is a train station and a bus stop within minutes. Easy access to shopping and restaurants. Make reservations before hand that way you won't struggle like we did.,1
Our check in was so fast| and even though I had a regular room I had a great view.  Even though they don't have valet right now| the lady at the desk quickly gave me a app to download for parking which was a secure locked location.  Downtown is so beautiful and being in the heart of it made it worth the stay.  I was in walking distance of restaurants| shopping| site seeing and more.   I'll never book anywhere else again when I go back to Chicago.  The Hilton has a forever customer now.,1
The location of the hotel,0
The only thing I didn't like is that you can't pay for the room in cash until after you check out! They charge your card for everything so you might as well just pay with your card other than that very nice hotel :),1
Great location. Very clean. Staff absolutely makes the hotel.,1
Great location but walls felt sort of thin(could here the neighboring rooms phone).,1
Fast check in| clean and quiet hotel. Highly recommended.,1
This is a older hotel| extremely small and have horrible decor.  I was disappointed| the entire stay.  My faucet leaked| I switched rooms due to spots on wall near bed; plus I hate I didn't have insurance to cancel.  Jordan/Front Desk assisted me at the time of check in and very NICE NASTY!Not worth your money!,0
Clean rooms and keeping up with the Covid cleaning.,1
Quiet floor| when I needed something it was quick| friendly service when you walk in. Nice coffee makerDidn't like: not enough coffee to start with ha I need more than 2 cups.,1
It's clean..staffs are very nice I would recommend this place,1
No room I was put into had actively working hot water. I was switched into 2 rooms with cold water. The water only got to barely warm but it was to the point where I just needed to shower and go to sleep. I was very disappointed.,0
I understand and totally agree on not to clean rooms daily because of coronavirus. However I called Guest services twice to get clean towels and K cups for coffee machine. It was never sent. And I told them what happened while I was checking out | they were like whatever| they don't care.,0
Great central location to everything. Would definitely stay here again!,1
No daily housekeeping and they did not tell you. Don't bother to pay extra for breakfast- it's not worth the money.,1
The area and the cleanest rooms nice staff the privacy,1
It was a very nice visit| despite the city being shutdown.,0
I like a location and convenience for our trip. Thanks,1
Excellent location; near attractions restaurants and around the corner from MAG mile,1
Perfect location for tourists| near everything like bars| food| tourist attractions| near subway to and from airports. The room itself was very clean and comfortable beds however we did find disappointing the amount of lighting in the room| they only have table and floor lamps no ceiling light besides the bathroom. Other than that it was a very pleasant stay!,1
Everything was excellent| except the AC/Heater unit.The system will blow air regardless if it's (OFF) which made the room dry making it  difficult to breath.,1
Great place to stay| service was top notch.  Not one complaint.  Will definitely stay at this hotel again,1
it was just a nice place for me|the people was very receptive| The young Lady from England was Just AWESOME,1
The housekeepers didn't clean my room for a day. So| I called the front desk and waited for 15 minutes| but no one come to my room. I had tried to call the housekeeps for 30 minutes before they come to my room. And have to wait 1 hr. for the room.,1
Amazing staff| from the front end to the maintenance man and anyone in between. Most comfortable beds| room clean| a little on the small side! Only complaint i have is you couldn't control the heat! So we slept with the window open!  Right in the downtown core| with access to The River Walk| the Millennium Park  Lakefront etc. Over all a great stayüòÉ,1
love that they were clean and customer service oriented.  Workout gym needs more equipment.,1
Everything was OK.  Nothing exceeded my expectations.,1
Booked online. Close to millennium park and trump tower. Easy stay in the city.,1
I enjoyed my time at this property. The room was clean| warm| and quiet.,1
Close to all the parks. Easy to get to Trump tower.,1
Comforters and bed sheets were of really bad quality,0
My family stayed here for the weekend before Xmas. Hotel is in a convenient location because we walked to most attractions (Christmas Market| Millennium Park| Starbucks Reserve). Hotel is clean and staff was nice.,1
The room was nice and clean the king bed was very comfortable,1
Staff was great! ordered extra towels and coffee and the staff was quick to respond! I'd stay again!,1
Great accommodations. The only downside was the bed was very hard for our taste. Great location| clean room| friendly staff,1
It was downtown next to EVERYTHING!  I had a Great Time seeing Chicago for the 1st time,1
The 10.95 dollar breakfast usually is free everywhere else,1
Perfect location for those of us who like to walk in the city!Great staff| always pleasant and often fun interaction! Wil stay again.,1
Location is very convenient The staff is very friendly,1
Vreey good close to center chigaco down town and clean,1
Great location for theater and museums. Food mediocre. Bed hard. Nice helpful staff.,1
Very clean| excellent location| staff is friendly snd helpful - i tried to tio a young lafy and dhe refused.  Having a fridge and microwave is a bonus.  Only issue wad hot water in shower.  You need to let it run full bladt gor 25 to 20 minutes before it gets hot.,1
The staff at the front desk were great! They were always there to give suggestions or answer any questions. We arrived late due to flight delays and had a very short time to get to the Bulls game we had tickets for and they went out of their way to get us checked in and on our way quickly.,1
Clean and nice| great staff.,1
Excellent location close to everything!,1
Great location.  Valet parking service pretty good.,1
Perfect place to stay| near many attractions.Would definitely stay here again.,1
Overall a very good experience. I would stay there again,1
This hotel is in a perfect location. It is close to different dining options| shopping and tourist attractions. I am a very sensitive sleeper when it comes to noise and I can attest it's in a very quiet area.,1
Awesome location near river walk. Everything is easy to get to. Great staff| very helpful and friendly!,1
Overall the accommodations were very nice. Excellent service and loved the restaurant and bar staff. We stayed 5 nights| by the third night our back and hips were sore we believe from the bed. Although it felt comfortable we noticed there is not much give in the mattress to allow the body to relax. The fridge was a nice amenity however it was hard to keep beverages from freezing due to lack of control over the temperature. Still enjoyed our stay at this establishment!,1
When we tried to check in first the woman at front desk was not accommodating in letting us know about an early check in and would not give estimate nor a call-back when room would be ready. When we called later with her again she had same unconcerned attitude. When we got a different front desk woman she gladly got us an early check in and told us about the Hilton reward system and offered locations for us to go.,1
Convenient location with easy access to many attractions,1
The staff were extremely helpful and friendly.Nice location.  Good room.,1
Customer service at check in was bad. Gentlemen was condescending and snobby. Very quick to move on from us!,1
The staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  This hotel is in an excellent spot.  You can walk everywhere.  We will return.,1
Good location for the marathon| less than half a mile to the start line. Not sure the restaurant on the ground floor was value for money.,1
Only few comments for improvement; slippers| no cotton bud| no complimentary bottles of drinking water provided.,1
Great downtown location. I booked the Hilton Garden Inn because I was attending an event at the Chicago Theatre| which is only three blocks away. The location was excellent| easy walking up and down the magnificent mile| dining and shopping. Lot's to see and do around. Hotel is only steps away from the River Walk which makes for a relaxing stroll and admire the building architecture.,1
The hotel staff are friendly| and the rooms are clean. Unfortunately the bed was very hard and uncomfortable| making it hard to get a good nights sleep. We had a room with a river view which I absolutely recommend| this was amazing!,1
Excellent experience! Would totally stay here again.,1
Restaurant service was spotty.  Mostly good| one waiter was uncaring and rude.  Room climate control was excellent. The woman who cleaned our room for most of our stay was excellent...on our last day the person was a no show. Front desk was excellent.  Room was a little small.  Breakfast was expensive.,1
Great location!! Easy walk to everywhere.  My first visit to Chicago| love the city and would stay here again!,1
Close walking distance to theater district.Would stay here again.,1
Awesome stay and they are flexible on our check out.,1
Great location. Clean| comfortable hotel.,1
This hotel is in a fantastic location| room was spacious| clean and bed were very comfortable. Staff were very friendly and allowed us to have a late checkout due to a night flight. Will stay there again.,1
Loved the hotel. So convenient because it's close to everything we wanted to see. Staff was really friendly and helpful. Only thing I would say is the honking at night due to the cars on the road got a little annoying but otherwise my stay was great,1
I loved that it was walking distance to a lot of places!,1
The property was status quo. Good location within the downtown area... close access to great sites; the riverwalk| millenium park| shopping| Michigan Ave. The hotel itself was clean| room and lobby alike. The customer service was A-1... Very courteous| helpful| professional and kind. Only one representative's disposition seemed a bit curt and short in her interactions with me (Camilya... I believe) as I observed her interactions with others. However| could just be perception. Otherwise| great stay.,1
Great location| quiet| near Mag mile.  Room was clean A/C was awesome.  Would come back for sure.,1
The riverwalk is the best! I loved it! You can see the Trump tower and beautiful Michigan lake!,1
Excellent staff and location.  Basic accommodations.  Hot water took forever.,1
Very clean| friendly staff| and good location that was close to everything,1
Great quality for price. Staff helpful and friendly.,1
I stayed a full week| this was a perfect location with the right amenities (the microwave and fridge were incredibly invaluable!).,1
Doesn't have a pool| but everything else was great. Breakfast was a little expensive| but lots of restaurants nearby. Centrally located downtown| so easily accessible to lots of places,1
Complimentary coffee in the morning and fresh water and cookies in the afternoon!! Location is great!!,1
The staff were wonderful| and the location was great.  The hotel looked tired and old . For the price| the room and public spaces were very ordinary| and our room smelled of stale cleaning fluid.,0
Very friendly and very helpful staff.  And very clean; great location!,1
Breakfast very disappointing - very disorganised and limited choice on continental breakfast.,1
This is hotel is in a great location. It is walking distance from almost everything. If you don't wish to walk| get a cab or Uber/Lyft. Our family was able to get to all of our attractions quickly from our hotel because of its location.,1
The property was in a great location. The room was clean. 5he bed was a little too firm for my liking. There was a restaurant onsite| but i didn't try it.,1
I reserved the hotel because I had read through the hotel amenities that parking would be complimentary. Unfortunately| this was not the case whatsoever. So| we had to use the valet service at $60 per day. RIDICULOUS!!,1
This is the perfect place to stay.  Close to the river walk| restaurants and shopping.  Staff was amazing.,1
Good with river view. Wish the window was wider. Staff was friendly,1
Great helpful staff. Perfect location.  Nice bar. Comfy bed. Shower head should be flexible,1
Great stay. Convenient neighborhood. Taxi stand across the street. Quiet hotel.,1
Fast elevators. Clean. Comfortable beds. Friendly staff.,1
Excellent staff| very warm and attentive. Comfortable bed and modern interior,1
Very good room nice and friendly staff especially Allen Monica I couldn't remember other names ...all very friendly,1
Room was decent. Pillows were terrible| A/C unit sounded like a freight train every time it turned on. Rooms temperature didn't stay consistent even with the freight train A/C unit. Previous guest had alarm set for 5am. So that went off woke us up again. Won't be staying at a Hilton for a long time.,0
Great location in downtown Chicago. The staff was amazing - very courteous and hospitable| always happy to help out and give great info. Rooms were nice and clean. Also liked the restaurant and fitness areas. Will be coming back my next trip!,1
The location of the property is great| if you don't mind walking! We were in town to attend an event in Grant Park| and the walk was totally manageable. We walked to Millennium Park as well (to see the ‚Äúbean|‚Äù) and dinner at House of Blues one night. The staff was great| but do be prepared to pay $64 to valet your car overnight| since that charge wasn't made clear when booking. Still a great value for downtown!,1
The location of this hotel is the most important factor why I choose it| within only minutes of walking| you can easily find the Big Bus Tour station| Architecture river tour check-in stop| and the most prosperous shopping avenue in downtown Chicago.,1
Bartender was nasty| front desk staff was great.  Breakfast too expensive.,1
The bedsheets had stains that while they appeared to have been washed| were still disgusting. Rug hadn't been vacuumed or wasn't vacuumed very well. Rest was ok.,1
Checkin couldnt have been faster I was prepared to leave my bags at the desk and kill 3hrs before the 4pm check in but my room was ready and they let me checkin early which was unexpected but wonderful my bed was so comfortable and the shower in my handicap room was so convenient the water temp pressure and the shower head was great I will stay here again for sure,1
Excellent hotel in a great location. Staff were attentive and very welcoming. There is a parking garage right across the street. I would use it instead of the hotel valet service. Wildberry and Broken English are two restaurants within a 5-7 minute walk. Many others to chose from,1
Front desk staff were efficient| friendly helpful. The citrus-flavored water was a refreshing addition to trips through the lobby. Soundproofing was great--I never heard a sound from neighbors| people moving through the hallway or the elevator when in my room.,1
Staff was exceptionally nice!  Very friendly and helpful. Room was comfortable. Will stay here again.,1
Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Great location. Easy access from Blue Line (airport train). Appreciated the noon check-out time; a lot of hotels are racing to the bottom with 11am checkout.,1
A fine hotel in a convenient location. Nicely appointed| but nothing special.,1
The property was centrally located and just a short walk from great locations.   Staff was friendly only negative was the lobby was extremely hot and stuffy when we were checking in| all looked uncomfortable.,1
Chicago riverwalk| cultural center| Millenium Park are within a walking distance. The location is phenomenal this is a very convenient and clean hotel. I'll definitely stay there next time I'm there.,1
Very clean| quiet| and great location.,1
Very nice hotel| Staff and location,1
Hotel was clean| comfortable and conveniently located.  It wasn't anything special| but definitely above average for this type of place. The bed was good| the shower was a walk-in| not a tub| which I really liked.  Free coffee in the morning.  Friendly staff.  Excellent location in the heart of Chicago and very close to the subway. You can take the subway directly from the airport to within three blocks of the hotel. Wifi was a bit slow.,1
Like the proximity in the city. What I did not like was the ice machine did not work and when staff was told they said ‚Äúgo to the 10th floor‚Äù (we were on the 4th).,1
Staff was very helpful| held our luggage on checkout day until our train over 6 hours after checkout.,1
Room/staff great services. Great location. Great price.,1
Great rooms| service| liked the soap| cleanliness| location.,1
just wish they had black out drapes. very bright in the room at night.,1
Two things stand out ... the location! ... we could walk to everywhere. And people were SO friendly.,1
Had a nice stay. Only thing is rooms are small so if you make coffee in your room the entire room has a pungent smell and the bathroom had no way of ventilation after showering. Also the woman put us right next to the elevator which wasn't convenient,1
The service was great. Friendly staff. Clean room.,1
Location is excellent with the river walk close by and restaurants everywhere.  Some delays at check in but the hotel refunded one night from our five night stay.  Bed was a bit uncomfortable but the price was terrific| especially for downtown Chicago.,1
The hotel was nice and clean. Close to tourist areas and shops and around the corner from the Chicago Theatre which we attended a concert so we just walked from the hotel so that was nice. The valet service was a hassle. It made me not want to go anywhere with my car because I had 25 minutes just for them to get my car. The night I checked in I forgot something in my car| the valet guy was rude and rolled his eyes because he had to go get it.. I mean it is your job...you're not supposed to make me feel like I'm a bother...,1
Pros: Clean.  Friendly staff.  Location convenient to Millennium Station and Chicago Theater.  Water and/or coffee in lobby.  Cons: Couldn't close curtains all the way to make room dark.  The HVAC unit only blew out cold air no matter what the setting on the thermostat.,1
The only negative is that there are only 8 rooms on a floor with the doors close together and are very loud when another guest enters or leaves. Overall great hotel and plan on staying there again.,1
Excellent location and a friendly| terrific staff.,1
I loved how close to everything the hotel was. We were able to walk to pretty much every location we wanted to visit. As as soon as you walk around the corner you get the amazing view and the river. Will definitely stay again.,1
I enjoyed the cheap price for the nice room for a one-night stay!,1
Close to everything downtown.Staff was very nice.Great service in the restaurant,1
Great value for money. Close to top tourist spots. Laundry facilities and business center are v helpful.,1
Hotel was convenient to everything. Staff were very friendly and helpful.,1
I liked the easy access to surrounding area. The room was small but clean. The staff was polite and friendly. It was OK. Nothing more| nothing less. Would I stay there again| probably not.,1
Basic hotel but all amenities provided. A/C unit was very loud and some of the lightbulbs in the room didn't work but otherwise no complaints!,1
Very good overall,1
the entire staff was extremely friendly and outgoing.,1
Clean and comfortable. Good location. Fridge and microwave were nice to have. Water and snacks were a nice touch.,1
"The hotel was very clean and almost all the staff| were very nice| making sure to say ""have a good day"" or ""welcome back"" everytime you came in or out. The location was perfect| we were able to walk to many tourist attractions. The room was clean however slightly on the small side. Parking was very expensive| however comparable to all the other hotels downtown. Overall would highly recommend this location!",1
Location is good and accessible to all the places that we visited but parking is expensive and not easy.,1
Great location and friendly staff! Would stay here again and highly recommend,1
Perfect location. Room very clean. Staff very friendly and accommodating.,1
So dry in the room. It's hard to get sleep. However| staffs were nice especially night staffs. Cant remember her name.,1
Superb location| room was clean and comfortable. Staff were friendly and generally efficient.,1
Great location| near to everywhere.Clean and comfortable hotel.,1
Great place to go around the downtown not only for business but also for shopping or sight-seeing.,1
Location is great| staff very friendly and supportive| rooms are very clean. I would book it again.,1
The property was clean but I didn't like that my room was not cleaned none of the day I stood there,0
Everything was perfect staff was outstanding hotel was outstanding love I would definitely recommend it to anybody,1
No transportation options to airports.Very limited dining options.No housekeeping.Room service was very overpriced and subpar quality food.,0
Quiet and options,1
It was just a fantastic place all of the staff was just so nice and professional,1
The place is clean and the area is nice and really close to Universal Studios.,1
This was a excellent hotel,1
I definitely expected more for what we paid for. The room smelt horrible| a mix of smoke and old carpet. Their Solution was to have someone spray Lysol.. that lasted 5 minutes.  The bed and sofa bed creaked| only one towel| spider webs everywhere. Definitely won't be staying here again. Sheraton next door is so much better,0
First class all the way,1
Nice hotel| close to universal with free shuttle to park. Amazing views. Would stay again.,1
Friendly staff| beautiful property and just a short walk to Universal Studios and City Walk.,1
For a Hilton group and at not so inexpensive rate our experience was very subpar. The check-in took a long time just to drag all our luggage and family of four to the 18th floor just to find out that the hotel room was either still occupied or hasn't been cleaned - dirty towels everywhere| trash| toothbrushes‚Ä¶bleh. Back to lobby for re-check-in and got a new room on 11th floor that definitely didn't provide the promised view of the Universal Studios that we paid extra for. We were given complimentary full breakfast for the next day as an apology| which was appreciated but still didn't make us love this place at all. On top of it| we were given the wrong password for the internet so gave up connecting after an hour thinking it must be our device. Nope - wrong info from the hotel service. I lost whole evening of work that I needed to do. Parking wasn't included and it's ridiculous at $30 a night. Breakfast wasn't included which was disappointing as well. There was also some dance competition during our stay so the hotel was crowded with teenage girls and getting an elevator definitely took some patience. Hotel rooms are smallish| starting to het outdated and definitely could used some upgrades. Also| we reserved the room for 4 people| and it would be great to have 4 towels and adequate  amount of toiletries in the bath. I had to call the room service and the missing items were delivered 45 mins later.Our experience wasn't great and definitely won't be returning!,0
The shower area drain was blocked and had to wait for 5 hours for someone  to clean. The nathroom floor was wer with water b cause of overflow and the cleaning crew came next day to dru itnup. Though they offered free breakfast| did not use it since it doesn't make up for kids waiting for soak in water after 100  temperature all day,0
Chaos at its finest. Hotel is nice and clean but staff needs to be managed better. Very unorganized and nobody knows what they're doing. Was promised free valet parking because of the horrible check-in process then still got charged. Restaurant pool bar was supposed to be open until 6pm we went down at 5:30pm and staff was already closing up and would serve us. Called customer service and was told we would get a call back.. never happened. Management needs an update.,0
Very comfortable very clean it's what you would expect from hilton,1
Super close to Universal Studios| great onsite eateries| pool area| staff were amazing. However for a family friendly hotel| the in-room fridge was small| no freezer| no microwave| only one towel hook in the bathroom| and no onsite laundry. The garbage cans held one soda can each. Breakfast was $28/person....cheap wine at the pool was $15. It seemed a little steep.,1
The room was clean and cozy. Super close to universal studios,1
Room was spacious and clean. good service,1
The hotel was very clean and the staff was excellent. Everyone went above and beyond to make our stay in excellent.,1
This property is at walking distance from Universal Studios Hollywood.The room was not cleaned properly (hair strands and dust throughout the room). For cleanliness| I will give minus (-) 5 star.,0
I loved everything about the hotel. Their buffet was so delicious| rooms were nice & spacious & staff was amazing as well! Oh and to add to that we went to universal studios as a family trip and it was about a 5-6 minute walk! Highly recommend!,1
Short walk to Universal. Closer walk to Universal than the Sheraton (I've stayed at both). The room was very clean and spacious. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it for those wanting to stay as close to Universal as possible.,1
Everything was conveniently located. There was even a filter water station in the lobby| which was such a fantastic amenity!!!! Every staff member we encountered was very friendly and helpful. Look forward to staying there again soon!,1
Room was beautiful.But shampoo was not full in the bottle and hair dryer was broken.And the most awful thing was breakfastÔºÅÔºÅ It was $30 !!Not fresh juce|Not many kind of fruits|Not many kind of breads.They have pack juce like school cafeteria.And apple and Orange and banana.Only watermelon was cut.They have a muffin and 2 kind of bread.I love Hilton.But this Hilton makes me disappointed.,0
"Started off not so good at check-in-we were early| but was told they may not have the room with view I booked even after check-in time-had a Seinfeld moment-""you can take the reservation| but you can't keep the reservation."" Our desired room was available by check-in & I was told they ""had to do some shuffling."" Again| Seinfeld moment-I booked this specific type of room a while ago. Also| we were staying for 3 nights| but they had  2 reservations for us-had to do 2 security deposits. We were told no maid service| but our room was made up while we were at the park the second day - maybe because of the 2 reservations? After all that| the room was great! Incredible view of the park and mountains! Clean room & comfy beds. Plenty of space| not crowded. The pool area was nice. Restaurant very expensive-$15 oatmeal| $21 avocado toast| etc. They've got you if you get up early| because the park opens at 9 and Citywalk at 11| so you have no options. That said| the Coffee Corner has breakfast paninis for $10 and muffins for $4. Short walk to the park| but they also have a shuttle to the park every 15 minutes. Upon arrival| we were able to store our luggage. Called down for extra coffee pods & tea| came almost immediately. Overall great| would stay there again when visiting Universal!",1
I had a comfortable stay| the room was clean and I loved my view from our room,1
Great stay and convenient so close to universal city and park,1
We liked how close it was to the park. The elevator selection and where it took you to in the hotel was a bit confusing but we figured it out.,1
Staff is amazing. So polite and helpful. Rooms were clean and cold to our liking. The only thing was the beds. They were very uncomfortable. The mattress was lumpy and shaped very awkwardly. Other than that| it was an amazing stay.,1
The place was clean and organized. Friendly customer service. We enjoyed how wonderful they were. We also| went to the hotel's restaurant and our experience was amazing!  Every single employee we talked to| excellent job!! A special thanks to Leo O. for been a great team player!,1
It's a great place to stay. Quiet| comfort and relaxing!!,1
Great location if you're visiting Universal Studios. If you get a room with a Universal view you may get to see a few free shows,1
Every staff member went above and beyond to make us feel welcome.  The room was lovely and very clean.  The mattress was too hard for maximum comfort but that was the only negative thing in an otherwise excellent stay.,1
The pool gate closes too fast and took the skin off my heal| which isn't ideal for walking around the park all day. The breakfast buffet was bland and appeared to be saved from last month. Shower didn't drain| so back to back showers threatened to flood bathroom.,0
The Hilton Universal was beautiful| clean| very comfy beds| staff members were helpful and friendly. The distance to Universal was just a few minutes walk. Breakfast was nice| pool was lovely.,1
We love the hospitality everybody had great customer service,1
This was the perfect place to stay for our trip to Universal Studios.  Clean| beautiful hotel with a wonderful staff!  Everyone was so courteous and helpful.  The shuttle to Universal was so convenient!  Plus| the walk to the park was only 6 minutes!  We will definitely be back!,1
Our first room smelled bad of smoke. We had to move rooms. The carpet in the lobby was tattered on some areas.  The proximity to the park was good.,1
pros: room is cleancons: parking fee is high| $35/night,1
The hotel is within walking distance to Universal Studios. The shuttle is nice if you just want to use it to walk around City Walk. The room was nice and spacious. Parking is expensive and there isn't any resturants or shopping close by to walk to. The room wasn't ready as expected and the restaurant is expensive although we didn't dine in either night. Pete's Coffee is expesnive too. A great hotel if you're going to Universal Studios.,1
I loved EVERYTHING in this hotel.,1
Best hotel we have ever stayed at.,1
We were supposed to have a 2 hour early check in| and a 2 hour late check out.But our room was not ready till after 5 pm.We were supposed to have a corner room with a city view.But our room was down the hall from the front desk.We were set to check out at 1 pm with the front desk.But when we came back to our room from the pool at 12 pm| we were locked out. We didn't get back into our room till 12:30 pm. It took a half an hour to wait in line at the front desk and security to let us back in our room.Other then that the hotel was clean and our food was great at the restaurants.The Pool area needs a bar and an upgrade to match other up scale hotels.,0
What I didn't like was left over food/crumbs scattered throughout the carpet in our room and the feeling of cleanliness was not present upon walking into our room. My dog came along for our stay and he ate the crumbs on the floor. If that had been chocolate then that would have caused medical issues.,0
Amazing! Located next to universal studios! Walking distance,1
Excellent location| walking distance to Universal Studio's. Enjoyed our stay| great customer service,1
My family and I loved our room and the view was beautiful. The staff were super nice and check in was a breeze. We will definitely stay here again when we are in the area.,1
Hotel stay was awesome compared to the hotel we had the night before ( H.I )...POOL was nice as well as the entire staff was soo friendly. Shuttle service to the Park and City walk was a plus! Will definitely becoming back ‚úå!!,1
Our stay overall was a good one. We had a great view of the theme park| which was perfect for the fireworks display. However| the water in the bathroom was a problem for us. The water keeps turning off and most of the time the flow in both shower and sink was very little. It was a challenge for a family of four to bathe. Doesn't matter what time of the day or night. The hotel should check the water pressure for the higher floors| especially during peak days.,1
The hotel is super close to Universal Studios.  They have a free shuttle but unless you have a wheelchair/stroller| etc it is just as easy to walk.  The service at the bar the first night was pretty slow.  The two things I would change| which would be easy fixes| are a mirror outside the bathroom and more hooks to hang towels.,1
Need to make upgrades to rooms| carpet is old and also microwave in rooms. Should be more modern. Minor adjustments| views were breath taking,1
Needs more towels per day.,1
walking distance to park,1
I liked the room we stayed in.  Very clean and spacious. Food available on the property was great!  Staff very friendly and helpful!,1
Trip was awesome| very family friendly| valet is super convenient and all the drivers are wonderful!,1
Great place to stay| so close to Universal Studios. Staff super helpful with special things in the park| recommendation of restaurants... definitely will be going back. Highly recommend,1
Liked the proximity to Universal Studios.  Was very crowded and the vending machines were out of order.,1
Staff were amazing and room was beautiful and clean,1
My stay was great. Very friendly staff.View was amazing! Only downside is wish I stayed longer.,1
I had really high expectations for this hotel. Unfortunately those expectations were not met.  The room was small and outdated,0
The entire room was dirty. You can see the black dirt in the tub and the towels were not organized.The front dest didn't provide the bottle water until I called. But I asked for 3 they only gave 2.The valet parking people lost one piece of our car sun shield.,0
Its ok,1
Nice and clean hotel.  Close to Universal,1
Our corner room was nice| had a great view of universal. Pleasing hotel and great location.,1
We were in a room with a connecting door and it was not very soundproof. We had loud neighbors who talked and laughed till late at night.That's my only complaint. The hotel was very nice and very clean.,1
About 5 minutes walk to Universal Studios.  There are no convenience stores or supermarkets within walking distance.,1
Our stay was great.  The rooms were clean upon arrival and I witnessed staff sanitizing frequently touched surfaces often which was great.  My only complaint would be that the showers/plumbing could use a little updating.   The water pressure was low and the shower drained slowly.,1
We chose this hotel for walking distance to Universal Studios. Check-in was a bit slow| but our bell hop was awesome! He kept me & my children company while we waited for my husband to park the car & find his way back up to the lobby. He was very knowledgable about the property & Universal itself. Upon entering our room| there was a strong cigarette odor| which was most displeasing. When we commented on it| we were assured the property was smoke free (now). Overall| we enjoyed what this Hilton had to offer & would most likely stay again.,1
Very friendly staff and very nice place to stay. Just very pricy to eat and park,1
I like that it was very close to the Park.,1
The customer service was HORRIBLE we waited for 2 hrs to be able to check in they did not help us whatsoever I would not recommend staying here again.,0
We discovered bed bugs in our suite during our stay. We privately and immediately brought it to the attention of the hotel who largely disregarded it and said they would let housekeeping know. Bed bugs| unlike other bugs| are considered a public health hazard by the CDC. A report of bed bugs requires pest control inspection and mitigation. Merely vacuuming will not solve the problem| which spreads to other rooms quickly and can follow guests home with an infestation in their luggage or cloth items. Bed bugs habitually leave a row of bite marks on their victims| and we gave the hotel picture evidence of our multiple bites. After the way they handled our report - which we made for their benefit and the safety of their future guests - we will never stay at a Hilton again.,0
It has absolutely everything you need! Amazing place to stay,1
Short walk to Universal was awesome. The AC unit In our executive room barely kept us cool with it set to the lowest temperature of 40 degrees,1
Great location the corner rooms were great for a family. The only time we really had a problem was when we were trying to catch an elevator on sunday.  18 tries we finally got.one withoit a bunch of.other people.in it,1
I enjoy staying at this hotel when we travel to universal studios. I wish the parking was a little cheaper| because after taxes it's pretty expensive. However| it's worth the money. The rooms are always nice and clean| and I like the restaurants they have.,1
"Great view from our room hollywood hills to universal park.Comfy bed"" nice bar down stairs| overall very nice",1
Celebrating my son's birthday at Universal Studios and this is our first time staying at the Hilton| and we are glad that we did! One of the best hotel experiences that we've had. Clean environment| great customer service with a really nice pool and great restaurants with yummy food!! You really can't ask for more under one location! We will definitely be staying here again!!!,1
The staff at the Hilton Hotel were great.  Everyone was very friendly and accommodating.  This great experience started the minute we checked in. Jerome| our check in host was fantastic and super nice.  We definitely will be back.  Thanks for a great weekend!,1
The property is beautiful. They have a koy fish pond and beautiful flowers all around. The lobby was spacious and had plenty of seating. I was a little bummed that they didn't have the airport shuttle available when i visited but they did have a one way shuttle to Universal Studios theme park. It was a short walk back but it could be tiring after a long day at an amusement park. The rooms were fully stocked and clean upon arrival. Bedding and pillows were comfortable. No house keeping service was available but they did bring fresh towels when i called down. The entire staff was wonderful and friendly. Room service food and the prime rib and lobster buffet was great! Pool was clean and towels were provided at the pool. The lyft from LAX was about $75 one way. Store in the lobby was very overpriced so beware. I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Universal. It felt very safe| especially during covid times.,1
Everything at the Hotel was Excellent.,1
Walking distance to the park very convenient,1
Very satisfied,1
Awesome location| great vallet service,1
The room had a very musty smell like someone had smoked in the room. The beds were kinda hard and not comfortable.,1
The service at the hotel was top-notch! Our room was beautiful| very clean. We had a corner room with an amazing view. Be aware that taller vehicles don't fit in the self parking garage. But overall| we had a great experience and would stay again.,1
Everything was nice and very helpful,1
It was very clean and convenient location.,1
Pillows were very flat and uncomfortable. One is flat a(gave me headache)| keeping two gave me nexk pain. Keeping one firm right pillow would be appriciated.,1
We stayed for our wedding night and it was made amazing by Roxane. She surprised us by upgrading our room to one we would never have been able to afford. She was so kind| welcoming| and considerate. Deserves a pay bump! The hotel itself is beautiful| comfortable| clean and has a great atmosphere. There are restaraunts within walking distance and within the hotel itself. It was such a great experience will be returning. Thank you Roxane and Hilton for a memorable experience on our special day! :),1
I actually got no sleep because of the room next door they woke me up at 1:50am and Wouldn't stop screaming until 4:00am I had to call the front desk about 3 times to get them to stop but I know they kept sending security so I know it wasn't there fault.  And in the morning they sent me breakfast vouchers that I appreciated because it meant that they cared.,1
Walking distance to Universal Studios,1
We stayed at the universal hilton and had a wonderful time. It was an easy walk to the citywalk and all of the shops and restaurants. Spent the day at universal studios| even came back to the room for a bit and went back. Staff was friendly and outgoing which i always like.,1
Charged for parking and wanted to charge for wi-fi not to happy with that will stay elsewhere next time!,0
Walk was super short to the park. The view was amazing. Staff was very accommodating and friendly. The bed was a highlight. First trip out since the pandemic and we will definitely be back.,1
Customer service was amazing,1
If it wasn't because we had made plans we would have never left the hotel. Had everything you could possibly need. Peet's coffee| awesome bar| and great little restaurant.,1
Unbelievable scenery into Universal Studios from our room. Gorgeous hotel. Very friendly and accommodating staff. 5 stars,1
The room is very quiet and bed is very comfortable. Parking is conveniently located below the hotel lobby| and I feel safe to put some valuables inside the car. It also has free charging ports for electric cars. But the bathroom is kind of old| it's a cheap shower tub with no hand shower for kids. The room also isn't cleaned well before we get in. We can still see little leftovers from previous guests.,1
Unprofessional and rude staff member| I didn't fully catch her name but I think it was Tori (Caucasian female). Basically from the moment I checked in with her she was straight up bullying me| maybe because I was Asian? I did a virtual check in and the app told me to go see the front desk. When I approached her to check in she was very very rude and said I was a liar and that I never did a virtual check in and she told me I should of read the fine print. Like why would I read the fine print and why would I lie to you? I am just following the instructions of what the hilton honors app told me to do and I just want to go to my room and rest after a long drive. Then when I gave her my driver license she made fun of my looks and told me what happen to me. Even her co worker (Latina| female) was In shocked and told her why are you bullying him. I use to be fat and my driver license showed my picture before I lost weight. It really hurt me but I brushed it off because I was tired and did not want to create a scene. I was silent after that and got my keys and left to my room. For the price I paid| I felt like I was treated like a third class citizen and it felt like it was a nuisance for her to check me in.UPDATE: so Tori just emailed me and she is the front desk supervisor...basically telling me an ‚Äúexecutive team‚Äù is reviewing my response. A very generic response..no wonder why she can get away with her unprofessional and rude behavior. She's the manager...nothing will happen,0
Our view from the executive floor was great. Staff was really accommodating as we had a big party and wanted several rooms together on our floor.,1
Walking distance from universal studios,1
Happy to visit again always happy staying at the Hilton. Restaurant was great service was good. Only thing wrong was the fan in bathroom was not working but still had a good time,1
Service was great| location was great| but the property is a little rundown| the rooms need a little remodeling| looks a little worn down .,1
The hotel is great| but I was advised not to book on Expedia in the future. I almost didn't get a room!  The hotel is beautiful| love the pool area especially.,0
Only con is for the price I feel parking should be free,1
Awesome room| great amenities. Walking distance to Universal Studios.,1
I love that is it walking distance to the theme park. After a long day at the park| knowing that your hotel is right beside the park| you can rest right away after a long day at the park,1
Full service hotel with restaurants on site and 24/7 room service. A 15 minute walk from Universal City walk and Universal Studios. Parking is 30 per night and valet is 45. The pool is nice and they have a fitness center. They have a lot of ballrooms so you might find yourself sharing the lobby area with business people. It's a nice hotel but it's not cheap.,1
Very very disappointed stay! First of all girl at front desk friendly but don't know much about her job| Dhe issue is key for the Room but then she could not activate the key so she offer me that doorman can help us get in the room and later they can issue the key. Then even though we book hotel WITH breakfast INCLUDED she ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to gave us voucher for it. Oh and by the way that breakfast included package include one cup of coffee and one pastry for which I paid $90 extra which they did not mention.  Excuse for that was given: COVID like always for every thing.,0
We loved the hotel and how close it was to Universal Studios. The staff was great lots of precautions with COVID-19. The heated pool was amazing! We also liked the convenience of being close to the highway. They have a food service you can eat in the evening right outside and that was great! üòä,1
Everything was great would come back!,1
Hotel was excellent.  My truck wouldn't fit in the underground parking| so had to park out front (and move it once| at the request of the hotel).,1
Very nice hotel conveniently located in Studio City. The room was clean and comfortable and the pool was great for the kids. We had a wonderful time during our stay.,1
Staff are friendly and kind. The rooms were clean. I would definitely refer someone .,1
We loved everything about this place| super clean and extremely friendly staff. Will definitely be staying here next time we are in town.,1
I am an essential worker and find myself still traveling a little bit for work during the pandemic. Different hotels seem to approach the restrictions and decreased customer flow differently. The Hilton at Universal like many (but not all) hotels have decided they do not need to provide much or work hard to win customers during this time. ‚ÄúNo we don't do that right now|‚Äù and ‚Äúyou have to...‚Äù are common themes. They are constrained and we get it| but they are also just providing the minimum and making no effort to earn our business and continued patronage. Disappointing.,0
The employees were extremely nice! Room was super clean!,1
Very clean..................,1
Was fine,1
Great overall! The gift shop was closed the day we left| when it wasn't supposed to be and the front desk wasn't sure why. My husband was bummed out because he planned on buying a certain hat from there before we left.,1
City view is the best,1
It would've been nice if I had had a complete update on what was available and what wasn't‚Ä¶ There was no water in the room‚Ä¶ No room service‚Ä¶ No valet‚Ä¶ So I had to kind of take care of everything myself. I should've had a heads up‚Ä¶ Or there should've been a major discount,0
I absolutely love staying here| very elegant. I'm fortunate for the price of the room which is why I decided to stay here. If you love sceneries| you will not want to leave your room| which is why I picked this hotel.,1
Werent aloud to check in for a ridiculous reason. Given a check list of things in order to check in| buy the time i completed the llist the shift had changed. It was 2am and the new shift did not allow us to check in with the previous shifts to do list completed. Refused to refund. Made me feel like a second class citizen and huniliated me in front of other guests. We had to sleep in the car because it was in the middle of the night and there were no rooms anywhere. The police woke us up in the morning because we were sleeping in the car and subjected us to a search of our car. Hotels.com was supposed to issue me a $40 credit which they never did.,0
Out of all hotel during the trip| this is the worst. The customer is bad| the manager is looking at me like I don't welcome here. The stuff just great without putting effort on greeting. You can tell on their faces. Other hotel feel like they welcome you,0
It was good,1
Quiet| close to food and shopping.this hotel also has great amenities.,1
Rooms were clean beds were very comfortable The pool area was amazing we felt safe they were sanitizing and cleaning it was a very awesome experience,1
Good property couldn't get the phone answered for housekeeping and front desk.  They need more people working there.  But the room and view were very nice,1
It was very quiet as there was nothing open in the hotel. Everyone was very nice and considerate. The only complaint I have is that I asked for an emailed receipt and still have never received it.,1
This a great location to stay. Close to everything yet not in the midst of a crowd.,1
Nice hotel easy access to highway. Staff was great. Very clean,1
Very clean and convenient for where I needed to be in the city.,1
Beautiful room| very helpful staff,1
During quarantine for virus| so it was empty| but everything we needed was there. The usual stellar service.,1
The staff was excellent. Great customer service. Kevin at the front desk and Robyn at the bar couldn't be more accommodating.,1
Great stay despite the circumstances. We left a day early and they waived the early check out fee| which i would expect|  but everyone was very professional and courteous.,1
Easy to get to. Clean. Updated. Nice views. Easy parking.,1
Beautiful hotel. Extremely Clean rooms. Friendly staff. 7 minute walk to the theme park and the city walk. They also offer a free shuttle as well.  Overall great experience.,1
Clean hotel with super friendly staff. Super close to Universal| have a shuttle but walking is totally doable as well. Will definitely come back.,1
There were pubic hairs on the case of the new blankets and pillows. The electrical plug by the door didn't work. The check-in lady could have been more pleasant in her explanations.The waiters by the pool and in the restaurant were pleasant and catered well. The location to City Walk along with the shuttle was great. Parking was tight during events.,0
Liked that it was walking distance to universal studios.,1
Overall the hotel was great with lovely views. The staff was super friendly as well. There were only a few minor things that were odd to me: 1. The trashcans didn't have bags in them. 2. There was no exhaust fan in the bathroom. 3. The only mirrors are inside the bathroom| which makes it a little difficult to get ready when you're traveling as a family. 4. My family wasn't impressed with the beds. I didn't mind them at all. Other than that| it was great. We took the shuttle at every opportunity for City Walk and Universal Studios. The shuttles conveniently run every 15-20 mins and are at no extra charge. We did find the restaurant to be pricey| but I guess I have to remind myself that no one plans a trip to Universal Studios to save money.,1
Staff was friendly and very helpful.  The only thing that was confusing was the breakfast setup.  The hotel offers 3 versions  of breakfast continental| universal| and executive.  The food items are all labeled universal or executive but nothing says continental if you only ordered the continental breakfast you have to ask the wait staff which items are included.  Besides this little inconvenience everything else at the hotel was great.,1
it is close to the park| so easy to walk. heated pool and Jacuzzi were great.,1
Short walk to Universal Studios and Metro. Spacious room and attentive staff.,1
Staff was great and hotel was clean.  Bed were too small,1
Our room never had hot water. We could have camped. Awful.,0
Expensive but worth it for the location. The staff are also FIRST CLASS !  Reception staff could not be more helpful. Breakfast was very good. Lovely Restaurant Manager who didn't charge for my son as he ate like a bird. Best waiters in LA couldn't get better service even in the Savoy London. Thanks for a great experience.,1
The Hotel was very clean. They also upgraded us  to a room with a view.,1
The Hilton Universal City is the closest hotel to Universal Studios and so is a popular choice for many visiting families. After a three night stay here are my comments:1. The front desk staff is fabulous. I was not charged for early check-in and was given a password for wi-fi. I was greeted with a smile and given tips to enhance my stay.2. There is an issue with the water. At one point| no water came out of the faucets for several minutes. For the rest of the stay| the water was lukewarm and smelled like sulfur. No hot showers at this hotel. 3. We had a corner room. It was small| but had a fantastic view of the park.4. The sofa bed was terrible. The mattress was very thin and groaned and creaked each time my child moved during the night.5. There is a shuttle that runs between the Hilton| Sheraton and the park. It drops off at Universal City Walk behind Johnny Rockets. We generally waited 10 to 15 minutes for it to arrive.6. The hotel will allow Uber/Lyft drivers to pick up and drop off at the main entrance.,1
Liked everything. Very clean | great staff | the front desk workers were very professional . Robyn | the bartender was wonderful . Danilo | at the front desk was very helpful. The Hilton is great.,1
Everyone was friendly.  The room was sparkly clean,1
Location to Universal was the main draw for us. Easy walk to Universal City. Only downside is there is no free shuttle service to the airport.,1
Some of the cafe staff was a bit rude and valet as well,1
Everything was great and I have nothing negative to say about this great hotel and location,1
Great hotel. Very comfortable.,1
Close walk to Universal Studios and the City Walk shops.,1
Everyone was friendly and accommodating. The hotel is very clean and modern.,1
Amazing location for universal city visit! Found food in lounge poor.Staff were very helpful and pleasant!,1
Nice property the pool is warm and open late. convenient shuttle to and from park. Staff was stellar,1
The proximity to Universal Theme Park and the staff was excellent.,1
Loved the location and the staff. Would stay again.,1
Liked- full size showerDisliked- hot water it not work regularly.,1
Hotel is steps away from Universal Studious| and 0.5 miles from Raplh supermarket| which are a big plus.Negatives for me are toilet paper is too stiff| shower water pressure is too low no matter what time. One day they did not give clean glass and no coffees.,1
It too end service. House keeping was excellent I wouldn't change anything,1
The service was fantastic during our stay. The remote control was not working when we first arrived so I called down. A service man was knocking on our door to replace the batteries within 5 minutes. We ordered room service| an omelette and hash browns. The hash browns were perfectly crispy and the hot food was hot.  he one major issue we had was with a dessert we ordered. My son has a severe peanut allergy so we ordered him the mango bomb as it did not list any peanuts. When it arrived the bomb had a nut crust. The nut crust has pistachios and peanuts. A potentially deadly situation for my son. We called and the chef said that he has asked for the menu to include the peanut warning but it hasn't been changed in weeks! They took the bomb off the menu but you need to disclose all allergy information.Having the chef ask and get denied that disclaimer shows contempt to your staff. That is highly irresponsible for your organization and I am very disappointed in the way you treat allergies and your staffs opinions on disclosure of allergens. Other than that major issue| the rest of the stay was great! Very attentive staff! The shower was perfect after a long travel day.,1
Nothing  the bathroom not clean the bed is not queen siz room to small for 2 bed,0
For the amount of money spent for this room| you have to pay additional for breakfast|  parking| and wifi. (And the wifi is awful) there is no microwave and the room is slow to cool. The guy that checked us in didnt give us any hotel specifics. I had to ask him about breakfast when he turned to walk away.,0
Great! Super clean nice room and bathroom. Very close to universal studios.,1
Great hotel that is super close to Universal Studios! Love the fact that it is walking distance and there is a shuttle that runs every 15 mins.,1
I overall our stay was nice. In the bathroom a long the edge where the wall paper is| there is a lot of sticky dirt & dust.  Has not been clean since who knows when. They desperately need to install bathroom fans.   The bed was comfortable | our grandson slept on a pull out couch bed| that was far from comfort. They did not sleep well. I do not recommend it.,1
For the amount of money they charge at this hotel| I expected excellent service and hot showers| as it is December and freaking cold outside. But I was sorely disappointed. We were put on the 2nd floor| which is one floor under the lobby| we had a view of concrete/backside of hotel and there was absolutely NO hot water. I complained to the front desk to fix this issue & they did absolutely nothing because the next day| there was still no hot water| not even warm. It was freezing cold| even after leaving the shower on for more than 30 minutes. After a long day at the park and with a child in tow| I find it unacceptable to not even be able to take a hot shower. I do not recommend this hotel. Not worth it.,0
Great hotel very conveniently located. You can just walk to Universal Studios or you can catch the shuttle. The pool and hot tub were a great way to end the long days at the park. We ordered room service and ate at the restaurant and both were amazing. Our family had an amazing stay in this location and I will totally stay here again.,1
Great service ... The only down side is there are no microwave in room (was told it's a state law that no room can have microwaves but I can get one put in my room for $30.. lol).Other than that room is clean| service are awesome| and love the shower ... water pressure was far the best ever.  Would just stay there again for the shower pressure.,1
Location| cleanliness are the things that I liked most.Room Service was so poor. No one was there to pick up the phone for a late night call.The servers in the launch was terrible.,1
We stayed 2 nights at this hotel due to its close proximity to the Universal Studios Theme Park and a Metro Station.The staff were cheerful| friendly and happy to help with travel advice.  We are from England and had not used the Metro system before.  They explained how it work and ticketing etc.  It was easy| cheap and convenient to use!  We used it to visit the Hollywood Walk of Fame.The hotel and our room were clean and modern.  It had all that we needed for our stay.  Breakfast was not cheap but it was plentiful with many choices.There were regular shuttles to the Universal Studios Theme Park.  We chose to walk there as it was only about 1/2 mile or 10 minutes max.  Passes can be purchased from the hotel concierge - who has deals to offer.   Overall| it was a really nice place to stay and I would recommend it for the reasons above.,1
It's a beautiful hotel! Great for the family! Very close to the park and walkable.,1
Great place to stay!!,1
The customer service was excellent! Linda pre checked us in early which was helpful as we spent the day at the park. The park is a 10 min walk.,1
We really enjoyed our stay at Hilton. The service was quick and easy| the room clean| spacious| and comfortable| and the view of Universal Studios was very nice.,1
Close to universal studios and had a shuttle to transport back and forth,1
The location was perfect for entertainment and dining.  The hotel staff was exceptionally friendly. Our hotel room was very clean and quiet.,1
GreAt room and stay,1
Location is excellent| short stroll to Universal Studios Hollywood. Service was wonderful| including great advice on what else we can do in the surrounding area.,1
Property is conveniently located within 5 minutes of Universal Studios and the City Walk.,1
The bed was great and I loved the pillows! The pillows were amazing. The bathroom was beautiful and up to date. I loved this Hilton,1
Charges for everything room was NOT what it looked like online and did not have coffee. My room service was almost $100 and half of the food was terrible.,0
There were no usb charging stations in the rooms.,1
Outdoor cabanas and promixity to Universal Studios. Our room had a strong mold smell.,1
My family and I would definitely stay at this hotel again. Location to Universal was amazing. 5 min walk was so convenient. Rooms was spacious and clean.,1
Location was close to universal studios and shuttle service was available to go which was very good,1
First of all this hotel is obviously very convenient to Universal and City walk.  They offer a shuttle but it's literally right up the road.  The downside is it's in a very busy area so if you aren't planning on spending a ton of time specifically at universal park or city walk it's probably not worth the cost.  The room was very quiet and comfortable with the exception of a broken thermostat.  The service at this hotel is AMAZING.  From check in to the restaurant staff to the valet everyone was very helpful and courtesy.,1
Quick access to the studio and very clean. Shuttle wasn't always on time,1
It was wonderful and staff helpful| the room was nicely furnished,1
Our room started to leak from the rain and no one offered any compensation or apologies or room change! Then we went for coffee at Peet's in the hotel. They close at 12pm and we were told they are closed at 11:45am.,0
Clean room| friendly staff| and hotel was conveniently located near restaurants.Toilet paper is very thin and rough sheet like the ones found in camping trips in national parks. Even airports have better quality toilet paper.Facial and bath soap were also of poor quality. They dry the skin.Curtain track was not working so the curtain could not close all the way.,1
I booked a room with breakfast included and now they have charged me for the breakfast!  Even though my reservation said that it would be included.,0
Every one of staff I encountered was particularly helpful| professional| and personable. I really felt that they cared about making my stay as great as it could be. Linda at the front desk was amazing| as was everyone at the bag desk. My room had a great view of Universal Studios| and I especially loved the quick bus transfer to and from the Citywalk zone--I used it multiple times daily.,1
Staff was very short and rude. I didn't receive any sort of welcoming smile. They seemed angry while I was checking in. The room was dirty. Specifically the shower still had a ton of leftover soap from the previous person. The furniture was worn and the bed wasn't very comfortable. It just wasn't the level of service and quality you would expect from a Hilton.,0
Great hotel| friendly staff| room was very comfortable.,1
wifi| for some reason this was extra........................................................................................................................................................,1
Beautiful large room with view of hogwarts castle. So close to,1
It was close to universal studios and other attractions.,1
Fantastic trip to celebrate our wedding anniversary.,1
Best hotel we've ever stayed at. I especially loved the pool and the restaurant| Cafe Sierra. All staff was very helpful and courteous.,1
"We liked the proximity to Universal Studios Hollywood (about a 10 minute walk| uphill).  What we didn't like was the lack of street lighting on the walk back at night.  It was very dark| there was no security presence| and you have to cross the street a couple of times.  There is a hotel shuttle available. The hotel was clean| the staff was nice| we really liked the free ""selfie photo booth"" in the lobby| and the filtered water dispenser.  The restaurant was good for breakfast (buffet was a little pricey| we ate ala carte and were satisfied with the portions).  The water pressure could've of been better.  Not sure if this was a hotel issue or a municipal issue. And I thought $30 a day to park in the lot was expensive| should be free for guests. However| if you're going to Universal Studios Hollywood| I would recommend this hotel.",1
Beautiful hotel| clean| very comfortable. Service was ‚Äúhit or miss.‚Äù The check-in staff was rude when I asked a question about the deposit I paid in advance and was over-all cold. Otherwise the staff was neutral.,1
We liked everything about the hotel staff and location .,1
Everything was great I just wish there was a refrigerator in the room. Also the daily parking fee so expensive,1
The Hilton Universal is a World Class Hotel  unmatchable in its quality and Care .Our  stay was pleasurable and relaxing .We will alway stay at Hilton if possible,1
I loved everything!!!  The staff was awesome| rooms very clean| and having a Shuttle to pick up and drop off from Universal City Walk.,1
Mayra the front desk person asked us  if there's a special occasion why we are visiting LA. Upon learning that  it's our 25 years wedding anniversary| she sent us  a complimentary champagne and hors d'oeuvres. That was very thoughtful and awesome. It made our stay very special. Thanks Mayra and the staff !,1
We are return guests and this time we had 12 family members traveling with us. The staff could not do enough for our family to make sure our holiday was perfect.Jess on the front desk always looks after us with booking cars| theme park tickets and bus tours. Location is perfect and very safe for children and family's.Great value for money.,1
My  room had a connecting door and the people next door woke up at 4:00am to watch television and was very loud so we won't ever come again.,1
It was a Five minute walk to Universal Studios and City walk. If you want ANYTHING else ( even tooth paste) and don't want to pay hotel prices| you will have to take an Uber or Cab,1
Location is great for Universal Studios and The Citywalk.,1
Nice hotel and within walking distance from Universal Studio!!,1
Great location closest to Universal. You could walk there or take the shuttle. Room service was great as well as their other dining options within the hotel. I would def stay here again. Staff is great too!!,1
Very classy and well kept property with a welcoming staff.,1
FANTASTIC location and room. Our stay would have been a 10+ except for a constant rattling sound in our room. We worked through it and it is important to disclose that we did not ask to move so they didn't have a chance to correct it.,1
The pool and hot tub were amazing.At check in| was treated like dirt. Not sure if it was because of booking with Expedia.  I was specifically told that they'd text when my room was ready.  They never did.  I told 3 separate people that I never got a text.  Met with silence.  No apology| nothing.  For that price| they should've been a lot kinder. Was told the shuttle would take me to Universal Studios.  Had to call an $8. uber .,0
This hotel was very clean and close to Universal Studios. Hotel staff were helpfu and friendly. I will stay at this hotel again when visiting Universal Studios. I can't recommend this hotel enough.,1
Parking. No wifi no breakfast no ice the shower pressure its too bad,1
Right across the street from universal studios Hollywood,1
The property was clean and there is a bar and restaurant that is nice. However| the property and the food/bar services are pretty expensive.,1
Hotel was very clean| walking distance to universal. Breakfast was very tasty.,1
Convinience! Location! The bus service  from the hotel to the Park. The amenities! The hotel employees are very friendly too.,1
Awesome! Everything was so nice and orderly. The staff| especially Jerome| was amazing!,1
Walk to Universal Studios. Good resturaunt at hotel. Clean rooms| great staff.,1
Location was excellent. Able to walk to Universal Studios and Studio City and excellent shuttle service also.,1
Excellent location to universal studios. Perfect for families who want to explore LA and be close to Universal. We had a fabulous time with the kiddos.,1
Very clean very nice,1
Staff was exceedingly friendly and accommodating. We had a small mishap in the onsite restaurant and they went over and above to make it right for us,1
Very clean.  courteous and friendly hotel personnel.,1
Stayed the night at the Hilton at universal studios to go to the Hollywood Horror Nights. Accommodations were First rate. Food was great| hotel staff are very courteous and knowledgeable of the area and we felt like we were given the red carpet treatment. Would recommend a stay at this Hilton to any who ask.‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,1
Clean| nice hotel and near the universal studio...,1
not clear what to eat at buffer breakfast due to complex labeling. and in the end you  have to pay 30 dollar for a little egg and saugage breakfast.,1
beautiful location and the view| within walking distance to the Universal Studios,1
I specifically liked the fact that the Hotel is just steps from Universal Studios. Me and my parents flew in for an overnighter| I spent the day at Universal Studios and they spent the day at Universal City Walk.  We all had access to the Hotel instead of waiting for each other or even waiting for a ride. The Hotel has complimentary shuttle service but the weather was nice enough to walk. So| the convenience is exceptional.,1
It was amazing,1
Very nice and clea. hotel. 10 min walk to Universal or they provide a shuttle. Great views from the upper floors,1
I paid $522..00 for one night.  Nonrefundable.  I arrive to check in| they gave me some hog wash story that they booked me in a room that was not useable.   So they are sending me to a hotel ten mins away.  They said they weren't able to contact me because they had no contact information| which was a lie.    I've had my Expedia account for years with all current contact information .  The room they sent me to was worth 260 a night.   I was with 7 teens arriving straight from homecoming.  I picked this hotel because it was close to universal studios.  On top of that I had lost my voice because I was really sick.  I was offered no accommodations for inconvenience.  I was not offered a refund for the difference in price.  .  It was a nightmare.  They sent me on my way like it was no big deal.  The only road to get to the other hotel was passing by the Hollywood bowl| which a concert had just let out| so I was stuck in concert traffic for 30 mins.  Their customer service was no where near what's expected from a five star.  I will never book again at any Hilton in the world.,0
Overall very good. The front desk lady is very kind| friendly and helpful .  Only flaw is the laundry sent did not return on time as told need to call up to remind.,1
Large wedding party with teens throwing trash all over.,1
Close to Universal| wish they had a better entry/exit location to access Universal Studios| walk was a little long but they do have a shuttle.  Bell service just gives out random times re:wait so that was no help.  Front desk lady who checked me in made me feel unwelcomed as she was not friendly and quite sterile. Parking is so expensive.  On the plus decor is beautiful.,1
Beautiful hotel. Nice staff. Room was beautiful and comfortable. Very close to universal studios (walking distance) and the city walk.,1
Place was great. Would'nt spend money eating or drinking there.,1
Really convenient hotel for Universal Studios. Nice overall our room smelled kind of musty we kept the AC high to combat the smell. They had movie night by the pool was family fun. Overall great time.,1
The hotel was walking distance to city walk and Universal studios| they also have a shuttle available that picks up and drops off and the hotel to city walk throughout the day. It was a great stay we will return in the future.,1
Staff were great and helpful| rooms were big comfy beds| waiters and bar staff were fantastic,1
Valet dept was the rudest employees Will never come back here again,0
the property was close to my destination| it had a shuttle| honestly my only complaint was that my non smoking room smelled like someone had smoked in it,1
The rides and shops were great. Most staff friendly. Acting was great from cast. The visual effects were great.Dislike... park closes at 9pm yet they don't tell you most rides and shows stop at 8pm like Zombie's|  Waterworld..etc. The cost to get express passes so you can go on any ride multiple times using  expeess lines are over $230 per person (more then 2 day pass to Disneylandwith hopper) Harry Potter ride will make you so motion sick even if youve never been sock before.  You cant being your purse on some rides| forcing you to wait in long lines to use lockers.Some staff (chick named Mitzy) that works at Mummy |gets super rude if you ask her if you can wait to get front row| even tgough everyone else had no issue with it at all.,1
The check in process was a little slow but there were no issues overall. The hotel has a pool| hot tub (which was not working)| room service was a little over priced but that was not really in expected. I liked the night time pool movies and even though I am a fan of ‚ÄúThe Princess Bride‚Äù I thought a newer movie could have been shown. Then again| Princess Bride is a pretty safe movie to show. Check out was a breeze. I think this goes without saying but: the greatest amenity is the 8 minute Universal shuttle,1
Very pleasant stay. My kids and I enjoyed the speedy check in and friendly staff. The shuttle drivers to and from universal were friendly too.,1
Whole experience fantastic except at entry before we entered the park when we asked a staff member to take a family picture with our camera and she rudely refused and said that she would only use her camera and we would need to buy the picture.   Sad!!!,1
We loved everything! The staff was super nice and helpful| it was so close to Universal studios they also had a shuttle. Our room was spacious very clean and comfortable. Well worth the money.,1
My room wasn't ready at check in.,1
The only complaint I had was lack of a night light on the bathroom.,1
Had to look up many details on tv.  Poor wsitress service.  Cost of parking.  Cost of food.  Loved shuttle service,1
Very close to the park| walk by 10 mins to universal city!,1
Within easy walking distance to Universal studios and city walk. Also had free shuttle back and forth and coupons for restaurants. Staff was great and welcoming.,1
Nice location| w/ free shuttle bus to Universal Studios| staff are great| clean hotel,1
The good news is it's near Universal Studios. The bad news is| because it's near Universal Studios they give an impression of not really caring. 2 rooms (of the 4 we booked) had a very strong and unpleasant smell of smoke. When we tried to change one| they mixed up the luggage collection and we had to wait nearly an hour to get our bags delivered to the new room (this was at 2 in the morning). In the morning the concierge| who we wanted to ask about tickets| was supposed to be on duty at 8am| didn't turn up until 8.45. All in all an unsatisfactory experience,0
Loved the property| loved the proximity to Universal and the shuttle service provided.,1
Great property overall. Only complaint is no working vent in the bathroom,1
amazing service - from the valet| to Elizabeth at the front desk| to house keeping and room service.,1
Hotel was really nice and clean. Friendliness and staff did a fantastic job. Also the shuttle drop off and pick from and to Universal studio was a great service. My families had a great time staying at the hotel.  Thanks for the recommendation. Great people's and services.,1
Great customer service| very accommodating staff. Beautiful rooms,1
Everything was so easy to get to. We loved the shuttles and the shuttles that took you away from the property| very good experience while staying at your hotel,1
Basic accomodation| room smelt a little. Clean and tidy,1
The overall stay was good. We just hate that you have to pay for wi-fi just to get connected.,1
Close to universal studio. Very friendly staffs. It is convenient to take hotel shuttle to Universal studio.,1
- Could not control: LA Traffic. No matter how close things may be| you have to give yourself a lot of extra time for LA traffic.,1
Very clean and staff was helpful. We plan to use the Hilton Universal the next time we come to Universal Studios.,1
Clean rooms| comfy beds| nice pool and hot tub. The restaurant was ok - breakfast took 45 min to get if you didn't order the buffet but the food was fine.,1
Beds are amazing| people are friendly| quick check in and within walking to universal studios,1
The staff was not friendly and took every opportunity to remind me that i was not a Hilton Honors member and that I did not get any extras such as a complimentary bottle of water in our room ( all other hotels we stay at on ur fam vacations do such as the Disney hotels| Hyatt hotels and Sheraton) | there is no opportunity you to upgrade our room at the least to a higher floor room instead of the lobby level because i was it a Hilton Honors Member. and a late check out was not an option because i was not a Hilton Honors member.  .  Even when the complimentary water machine fill  up broke in the lobby| i asked if they have any bottled water because the machine was broken | they said that this is only one time opportunity because i was not a hilton honors member .  They sure did take the $1|400 i spent for 3 nights even though i was it a Hilton Honors member .  never again Hilton| so disappointing .,0
Super convenient location to Universal Studio| love the hotel!,1
Rooms are basic. Review score down to 2 of the 4 rooms we were in smelling of stale smoke or so strongly of smoke that we had to move. Night reception then screwed up the room move which at 3am is not what you need.,0
Great location| across street from Universal and 15 minutes drive from Warner Brothers.,1
My only issue was wifi access both in my room and at the convention I was at was off and on.,1
We had to use the hideabed couch and it was AWFUL!!! These need to be replaced if you are advertising that they are an asset to the room as a matter of fact I think the one in our room was broken!Everything else was great| comfortable enough bed and very lively room with an awesome view,1
Stayed here for my daughters bday and went to universal city walk and universal studios. They have a shuttle that takes you back and forth which is nice.,1
Great place to stay near Universal Studios| only thing was our shower was leaking a lot of water to the floor.  Other than that| we will definitely stay here again when we come visit.  The pool is also amazing| especially at night.,1
The pool and breakfast were great. Great location. We could have used a laundry facility.,1
Property is close to Universal Studios (walkable) . However| upon checking in the front desk clerk is less to be desired. She had the personality of someone who hates her job. She put us on the 2nd floor in a handicap room without informing  us. My husband is 6'4 and the shower was very low for him. Plus ..NO hot water for a shower at the end of our day. My husband| 2 little girls and myself had to take cold showers. We waited to see if the water would warm up by letting it run for a few minutes.No success.Wallpaper was peeling in the bathroom. No hair dryer. Location is great| lady at the front desk was inconvenienced by our simple questions.We usually stay at Hilton's when traveling every year| but this location is a HUGE disappointment. Only plus is the close proximity to the park. 5-7 minute walk .,0
Busy| but comfortable hotel. Great location. Room was great| but avoid the sofa bed if you can! Very uncomfortable. Staff were lovely and bar area and food were great too. Overall| great stay| but quite pricey.,1
Great experience. Staff is so accommodating,1
I did not like paying for the parking| it should be free.,1
Everything is Excellent! Staff| location| amenities. Makes our holiday| perfect. Thank you.,1
I didn't like when we have to ask the housekeeper to clean our room.,1
Checking in was a nightmare| got to front desk at 4pm| their listed check in time. Room wasn't available they said they'll text me when it is. They never texted me until I checked with the front desk at 5:15. Lobby had many people waiting with the same situation| rooms not available on time.,0
Excellent front desk service !   Best attitude from over 100 hotels in past few years :),1
Amazing hotel ! Loved all the amenities the hotel offered . Definitely staying here again,1
The tub leaked| sink backup constantly| price of rooms overated.  Parking cost was too high per day.  Nothing reasonably priced.  Pool was booked for private events forcing us to use sheriden.  Will never stay there again.,0
We loved the location and staff at the Hilton Universal City,1
they have charged our credit cards multiple times | its for same charge| they are a scam,0
I liked everything. Only wish I had a better view| but I chose a cheap package deal through an online website.,1
Went on flow | all right and pleasant... it's  all good!,1
The location was perfect for going to universal studios.,1
Check in time said 4pm. Room wasn't ready until 6:45pm.Pictures on website obviously enhanced| room small and stuffy.,0
Nice place very convenient because their is a shuttle. The only thing no free breakfast,1
I loved the clean the hotel was and the shuttle to universal was a hugh plus for me. Thats why i decided to stay here with my girls. What i didn't like was of course the high room rate but like usual you get what you pay for and this hotel was elegant. Only other dislike was that i had to pay for internet service. For what I paid for the room that should be a free service to their guest. But overall we look forward to staying here again when doing a Staycation in Hollywood for universal studios.,1
The great leadership and the excellent team work top to bottom| front to back. You guys are AWESOME üëèüòé,1
Perfect location. Avoid breakfast unless it's included. Great staff.,1
I like the location of the hotel and shuttle service to universal studios.,1
Good in general! We had a comfortable experience.,1
The bathtub rod  is rusted.  The bathroom is kind of small| so if you are traveling with your family you may want a bigger bathroom. Also there is not much counter space. We made due my storing toiletries in the gorges.,1
The neighbors with kids were very loud every night| we were also getting a real strong odor of weed coming from next door neighbor. Toilet was leaking| it was fixed the next day but then it was flushing on its own throughout the night. They fixed it. Overall it was an unpleasant stay.,0
Convenient to univeral studio access.  It has a lot of hidden charge.,1
45 minutes to wait for the shuttle| nobody clean the bathroom poor service but they took the tip,0
The Hilton was a perfect spot for family trip to Universal Studios.  It was an easy walk over or shuttle ride (shuttles ran very often).  We also really enjoyed the nice pool and hot tub and poolside bar!,1
Room was great and hotel is close to universal studios,1
Our first stay was for one night. Everything was great until we went to check out. Our car was vandalized while parked in thier secure valet parking lot that cost us about 50 dollars to park. We spent 4 hours of our vacation messing with reports and law enforcment. While the hotels fix was to offer another night at a dicounted rate. So we returned a few days later to try again. Thier fix was a bottom floor room with only one bed for 3 of us. The room was small and the shower was a handicap shower so you had to lean down or sit down to wash because it did not work properly. To top it off they made me pay 200 dollars for this. Needless to say we where highly unsatisfied with the hotel apology and will not be staying there again. Consider going to the Sheraton that has the same shuttle to the amusement park.,0
Very nice hotel.  Everyone we interacted with were very nice.,1
Good services. Always clean. Love how close to the park it is,1
Close to everything that I was doing that week staff was great nice pool,1
Nice hotel| but the food at the expensive buffet was terrible and kitchen staff as well as waiting staff were terrible.Managers were good| but staff need more training.,0
Price was great and the room service fast and good. Staff went out of way to be helpful.,1
Wonderful location nice and quiet and right next to universal Studios and Universal City Wall,1
It was great this was the 2nd time I have been at hotel.,1
Highly recommend!!,1
Great location and staff.  Went out of their way to help.,1
We had granddaughter with us who is really to old to be sleeping with us. We were given one king bed later told the couch. Dinner in the restaurant was just okay| for 2 of us the 3rd a pizza didn't arrive until after we were done eating and the waiter ‚Äúdropped‚Äù it on the table and said just take it I'll take it off your bill.  He appeared agitated we canceled the pizza. Charged to use the pool...seriously at 300.00 a night you charge to use the pool? Overall not a good visit,0
Nice property and convenient to the park. My only complaint is I wish the water pressure was better on the shower head.,1
I stayed one night with my family| very nice hotel| 5 min walk to Universal Studios| the only thing I would say the room was lil bit hot it took a while to cool down and you have to pay for internet and Parking,1
Just because a customer is not an HONORS MEMBER of HILTON that bottled waters were not given on arrival and not supplied in the rooms to make coffee.  I think it's a discriminatory practice for this hotel.... We are also paying customers!,1
The hotel was great! Nice| clean and convenient! Walking distance to Universal Studios Hollywood!,1
Easy walk to Universal City from the hotel property.  Thanks,1
Employees were very friendly and helpful!  Best part was in Harry Potter land where everyone was participating in costume!,1
The hotel is a good 10-15 min walk to Universal Studios uphill. The air conditioning in our room did not work and we were transferred to another room. The hotel is fair but you can be overlooked due to sheer volume of people staying at the hotel. There are no shops nearby for basic amenities and its very far from anywhere. Recommend a closer hotel to LA. Taxi fares are not cheap!,0
Heated pool a plus. No micro or refidge in room.staff very friendly.,1
Great hotel!  Clean rooms| comfortable beds| friendly staff| well stocked convenience store| and three options for food and beverages on the main floor. Free shuttle to Universal City Walk also.,1
The Grounds and lobby were spotless and very well-kept and the room was mostly clean but had some small marks and stains etc.The room we were given did not have the view we paid for we had a good view of roads and not much else when we expected a view of the universal studios this was disappointing.We had a bad experience with the staff at breakfast attempting to overcharge us.We were happy with the filtered water which was free in the lobby.Overall for the price| I feel we should have had a different experience..,0
Ivhad to leave a deposit fir the anenities which i was not aware of.,1
Great place to stay if you are going to Universal Studios. You can walk to the Park or take a shuttle. Room was large and well-appointed (particularly the bathroom). Breakfast buffet was excellent.,1
It was a pleasant stay. Staff were accommodating and friendly. It was so convenient that it was walking distance from Universal Studios. I would definitely stay again in the future. The only thing is that I'd prefer a room on the top floors.,1
Close by attraction friendly staff| clean| accommodations AWESOME EXPERIENCE,1
Very convenient and there is a free shuttle from hotel to universal city,1
It was a perfect stay. Clean| stylish| large well-appointed rooms with floor-to-ceiling glass windows with great views of the city. Comfortable large beds. Quiet night of sleep. And| it was capped off by a great breakfast.,1
Friendly staff. Good ambiance. Food is good.,1
This was our first big family trip to a theme park so I picked the closest hotel to the park. Check in was a breeze and the valet was quick and friendly. The room was big and clean. Beds were firm and the bathroom was big and stocked with enough towels for my whole family. We used the hot tub and heated pool after our day of travel and it was perfect tempature. They provided towels in the pool area which not all hotels do. They came in a made our beds while we were gone the next day and even stocked up our coffee which I have never had done with other hotels. My daughter had a good laugh because they wrapped her stuffed pig like a baby with her blanket and left it on her pillow.  We will defineltly be back for our next visit. Hilton has spoiled us forever.,1
Stayed one night - check in was easy| staff friendly| room was clean and spacious.,1
Amazing!! Friendly amd attentive staff. Great amenities.,1
Fantastic hotel and within walking distance to Universal Studios and The City Walk. Quality rooms with heavenly beds.,1
Everything was great! Front desk staff was very kind and helpful. Loved getting greeted by everyone in the morning.,1
The hotel and staff was amazing. I will definitely be staying there again!,1
The only thing I noticed that was odd was no fans in bathroom.,1
"Room was nice. Sofa sleeper was not the greatest and the room smelled of second hand smoke even though its a ""non-smoking"" room. The location was perfect. We walked to Universal and City Walk very easily.",1
From the moment I arrived it was a smooth easy process. Very clean. Friendly staff. The room was perfect. Bed and pillows were so soft and comfortable. I really enjoyed my stay at the Hilton! I would definitely recommend this hotel and would definitely go back.,1
Close to USH and city walk| about 7 mins walk.My room was on 24th floor| I can hear voices from other rooms which is not good enough.,1
Free shuttle to Universal Studios (awesome) and good views of Universal Studios.  We were able to view the projection show of Hogwarts Castle (Harry Potter) from our hotel room. Dining options are not bad and easy access to free (filter) water| really wish more hotels had this option.,1
Property was clean| staff was friendly. Room service was fast. Valet parking was efficient,1
The proximity to Universal was great. We also loved the pool:-),1
Walking distance to entertainment,1
We liked thst it was within walking distance to Universal.  The staff was kind and friendly.  They found out it was our sons 16th birthday and sent him cake and sparkling cider.,1
The hotel is realy clean very nice and friendly staff,1
Really close walk to Universal Studios| very friendly staff| nice and clean,1
The location that was so close and convenient to universal studios .,1
From the bell captains (thanks Jo-Nathan) to the restaurant servers (great chatting with you Amy)| this property is one of the beat we stayed at ever. Room size perfect -and we are two large adults and two teens. Bathroom lovely. Beds and bedding comfortable. And I could see HOGWARTS from our room!! Extra $ for the view but totally worth it to us. $65 pp weekend dinner buffet‚Äî sounds expensive but you WILL get your money's Worth. Pool (heated!) a little too crowded but attentive staff and good pool grub and bar.,1
Amazing | great room| great food| and a great time,1
Great stay as we were going to Universal Studios and you could not have got closer.  BUT the hotel is scruffy and needs some tlc to be able to compare itself to the Theme Park.   The restaurant food was terrible| and the service in the restaurant at night was not good at all.  However in the morning the breakfast was just lovely and the wait staff were delightful.   The bar area was fine but that too could do with a face lift.  Over all it served the purpose of being in the right location for our needs but overall was disappointing.  It felt like a tired hotel near the airport :(,1
The pull out sofa was dirty I requested service on the pull out| and although one of the ladies came soon she did not put clean sheets on the pull out sofa| after she opened it and left the room smell like dirty feet!  The ladies at the restaurant was snobby and not cooperative. I was promised a complementary rolling bed and it never arrived. My daughter an I (62 years old) had to move the heavy glass center table in the room| with a 2 year old it was dangerous.,0
Beautiful property and nice staff.  Good food at the restaurant,1
Staff was friendly and helpful from checkin to checkout.,1
What I did not like is that the hotel is the extra charge of the breakfast and the confusion of prices for the breakfast.,1
Great walking distance to Universal Studios. Shuttle leaves every 10 min.,1
Great place to stay friendly staff and very clean rooms,1
Sent my daughter and her husband on this trip. They said they were treated very well and loved the hotel. Perfect location to visit Universal Studios.,1
It would be nice to have microwaves in the rooms :),1
The hotel was nice. We sat down for cocktails and my wife's drink (manhattan) had bugs in the bottom. The waiter asked if it happened at the table and I told him I have no way of knowing but he should check the cherries. He came back with a fresh drink and said it was comp'd and asked if I wanted another. Later I checked the bill and saw that he comp'd her drink with bugs but still charged us for her remake. I don't think this was normal behavior and the bartender and waiter (Sergio) acted truly surprised| but could have made our experience better by at least buying her the second drink| if not both our drinks.,1
The people and their customer service.  They were friendly and very helpful.,1
Quiet room|Spacious room and bathroomAppreciated the shuttle service,1
It was great!! Just minutes from the Park and City Walk. Would stay there again! Thank you!!,1
Next to the park. It's pretty and nice. Love that room service is available 24 hours,1
Everything was good. It was clean and very. Right.         It wasnt long enough,1
Room was too warm and for some reason the temperature control didn't seem to work. Otherwise everything was great,1
Close proximity to the park and other entertainment establishments,1
It was great to ge away for the weekend,1
Everything was great for the exception of the parking fee. Outrages! Regardless if you self park or valet its a daily charge.,1
Great location and great customer service,1
Very accommodating.,1
excellent hotel...excellent customer service...We love it here.,1
Clean rooms and facilities.  The hotel itself was nice and the staff was perfect.,1
Clean| comfortable| but cramped| with the pull out bed there was almost no room.  Space is not an issues if your spending your time out sound activities. It is a short walk to universal in a nice part of town.  The hotel food was overpriced for what you got but it tasted good.  We would stay there again.,1
The room was great the valet staff was great and very friendly and helpful since we drive a electric car. They were able to help us get it plugged in every night. However the front desk staff did not make me feel very welcome or friendly.,1
Friendly personal!great location if you are visiting Universl!,1
There was lots of great things to do and see at the hilton,1
Excellent place and very clean. Very close to Universal Studios| about 5 minutes walk. Room is super clean on arrival. Front desk registration not so friendly. Dining area very clean. I hope management will re- train their front desk registration area on how to treat arriving customers in a friendly manner.,1
The proximity to Universal is great| as well as the room service and pool area. What I didn't like was the front desk and it's inability to handle rude people. Twice I was cut in front of by others and the staff did nothing. Also| the fridge did not work| there was a big yellow stain on our sheets| the remote did not work| and the fan in the bathroom didn't work. We let it be known but was never re-engaged on the matter. Normally I wouldn't be so nitpicky but for what we spend I expected more. Also| be prepared for every tax known to man to be thrown your way. Occupany tax. City tourism tax. State tourism tax. I mean sheesh. It's a massive cash grab.,0
Efficient staff and nice rooms...easy check in and out!,1
I liked the close proximity. What I didn't like was how the staff just didn't seem ready to handle rude and unruly people. Twice I had someone cut in front of me at the concierge and check in desks and the employees just let them.,0
Rooms are very spacious| friendly staff| pool is open late (until midnight)| Peet's Coffee onsite| great views. My only complaint (and this isn't specific to this hotel only) is that the walk to Universal isn't all that convenient. I wish there was a bridge that went directly to the hotel area spas to avoid walking in the traffic.,1
Friendly staff ....super clean....eveything is close by ...10 min walk to universal studios,1
Free shuttle to and from universal City every 15 minutes| right out the front door of the hotel,1
It was a great stay| very nice location and excellent hotel and service.,1
Clean restaurant was expensive  quiet big shower  quick elevators,1
Clean| Comfortable| near attractions| super nice staff| affordable,1
Amazing service and location,1
We were coming into LA from Denver for a quick trip to celebrate my niece's 10th birthday at Universal Studios.  The location was perfect.  It was a quick walk back and forth.  We had drinks at the bar and had breakfast at the buffet.  The bartender was very polite and caring.  He even went out of his way to get my son a band aid w/ointment for a small injury that my son had.  The buffet was great.  Lots of choices and the food tasted awesome.  The staff was super nice as well.,1
The service was pretty disappointing. Takes forever to get a pair of slippers,1
Our stay was great!  The location worked out good as it was a convenient distance from our family we were visiting.  We plan to stay here again.,1
free shuttle to Universal Studios| very friendly staff. hotel close enough to walk from the Park if we stayed after shuttle hours. would like to see shuttle hours later on weekends.,1
ALL staff were friendly and helpful! Perfect hotel experience for a Universal Studios weekend trip!,1
Very close to universal studios| very modern hotel,1
Beautiful property| excellent location to Universal and CityWalk| spacious rooms| helpful staff. Many hotels are now offering free wifi...why is a higher end hotel like Hilton still charging? It seems stingy. Also the breakfast buffet was overpriced for what you get. Otherwise enjoyed our stay.,1
Happy overall except for the room service. Took very long for us to get our request and did not even bring what we ask for. We ask for 4 toothbrush and only brought us one. We ask for lotion and nothing was sent,1
loved everything about this hotel the only thing is the rooms do not have microwaves so i asked the lady at the front desk if their was anywhere i could locate on she told me NO and that i could rent one for 10 dollars,1
It was extremely close to Universal Park and had a shuttle every 10 minutes. Rooms were clean and spacious. I would definitely recommend to anyone planning on visiting Universal Studios. Booked a room with views of the park and couldn't have asked for anything more it was beautiful at night! However| if you plan to take a shower make sure hot water comes out because I had to take a bath in order to have hot water because the shower water was ice cold! Didn't complain considering I was only staying 1 night but its it was longer they sure would have heard from me.,1
We loved our stay!!  The location couldn't be better| and the views were amazing!; the staff| very friendly and professional; the accommodations were flawless - very clean and cozy. We'll be coming back| for sure!!!,1
Good service and very helpful concierge.  Good location for visiting universal studios.  Hot water in our room was not hot and regularly turned cold while showering.   Apparently it's a known issue for some rooms.  Close to restaurants and shopping in Universal City.  Short drive to local areas and Hollywood area.,1
Great! They texted us when the room was ready| the staff were very accommodating and helpful| great location with a shuttle to take us to Universal City walk. Breakfast and room service was amazing!,1
the location and ambience was very pleasing. staff were courteous.,1
The environment was awesome. The room was very clean and it was very spacious. Also the bartender downstairs was amazing I can't remember his name. He was very friendly and his service was great. He's been working there for years. I love everything about Hilton. I would definitely go there again.,1
It was an amazing hotel| in a great area| there were just a few minor mishaps. 1st thing was that our room was freezing most of our trip| an engineer had to come fix the heat| the remote to the TV didn't work| also for the expensive price| it would have been nice if the room came with a microwave and the shuttle only took us to and from Universal but not to any other close landmarks| lik Hollywood Bvd| Sunset Blvd.,1
Great location to Universal Studios. Spacious rooms with good fitout. Comfortable for families. Would stay again.,1
Like location and comfort.  Don't like that they charge for basic internet.  Many hotels that charge far less provide complimentary internet.,1
Excellent location for visiting Universal| or as a home base for seeing sights in the Hollywood area.  Universal and the City Walk are within walking distance| or there is also a convenient shuttle that will take you there as well.  The only negatives are the price of the room| and the $28 per day self parking fee| which I felt was excessive considering how much the room cost.  The room itself was nice| clean| and well equipped.  Excellent view from my corner room.,1
Best place to stay while visiting universal studios.We love the comfort and great service.we always stay at this location.,1
Enjoyed our stay with an excellent view of theme park,1
Easy access to Universal Studio and super friendly staff!,1
took 40 minutes to check in| no hot water one day| no lyft pick up| not enough staff,0
The trip was very fun and exceeded our expectations,1
Everything was great. Just a little pricey.,1
The bar tenders at the lounge were unbelievable.  Perpetual motion!  Spot on with drinks| food| ect.  Waitress at breakfast  were excellent.  Front desk staff were great as well as the Concierge.  Only problem was that we were on 23rd floor and never even had warm water for showers.,1
Great hotel next to the studios. Would definitely recommend,1
"They checked us in to the hotel knowing that there was no hot water though out the entire building! We were with having to take a shower for 2 days!!! They claim that they could not give us money back on the hotel room because we pre paid so there ""compensation"" was for a $75.00 food voucher! One of the women I spoke to at the front desk was soo rude...when I called to ask about the water| she told me ""she was not maintenance| that was not her job""!!! Was a very frustrating experiance and now that I know pre paying through a site like this| if something goes wrong| I will not be compensated!!!",0
Pool being renovated. No jacuzzi available. Water shut off and cold when back on.Good location. Only one shuttle running at times to universal.,0
Convenient location| less than 10 mins walk to studio and city walk. Friendly staffs| my room was upgraded to 19 floor| amazing view,1
The room service took so long and the front desk keep calling me a few times if I got the service already.,1
The pool was closed and there was no water during the night and in the morning there was no hot water to take showers so,0
Didn't like they hadn't informed the pool was closed ahead of our trip or when booking. No pool| late check in and early check out.,1
It is wonderful that staying in Hilton hotel. It close to the universal studios. It is very easy and convenient to go to universal studio. Hotel has shuttle bus to universal studio.,1
The only unique thing was the view | the things I didn't like was the lack of comunicaci√≥n between the staff and the client | also extra charges that I didn't order or ask for it so basically they are thanking to rip-off clients,0
Clean room with a nice view;very close to universal studio,1
I think it is worth what ever you pay not to have to fight the crowds getting into Universal or the City walk. The free hotel shuttle make going and coming a breeze.,1
Location and Customer service.  Will definitely recommend.Breakfast service was a little slower| but overall very happy.,1
It was just what I was looking for| nice and close to the theme park.,1
It was great to be so close to Universal Studios! There is a free shuttle to Universal studios every 15 minutes from 9 am| but it takes about 7 or 8 minutes to walk to Universal studios. The outside pool is heated and open pretty late. Totally recommend this hotel! Very clean and breakfast buffet at the hotel was great!,1
Close to park but shower was very low pressure and beds were not comfortable| I expected more from Hilton for the price. The food in the bar was delicious and the service was outstanding.,1
Within walking distance to Universal Studios. Or shuttle Service is available.,1
The shower was nice and clean which I loved it ..and. Was waking distance to universal studios,1
I don't write hotel reviews but this property needs recognition as the staff were amazing the hotel was beautiful and all the restaurants we tried had wonderful service that made my wife on her birthday weekend feel special. Very dog friendly with a spot just for them by the Koi pond. Not to mention it is a quick walk to Universal Studios not have to deal with all those shuttles and traffic.We will definitely stay again,1
Loved the pool. Very pretty. Staff is awesome. Great place to stay. But WiFi is to expensive,1
Super clean and friendly staff. Close to universal park.,1
Short 2 night stay to visit Universal Studios. Great location with free shuttle to Universal City Walk & the park. Staff nice and helpful...,1
Clean| convenient| friendly staff. Perfect for trip to universal studios.,1
Great hotel close to Universal|  free shuttle runs every 10 minutes|  great drivers. Staff helpful nothing too much trouble,1
Great staff and hotel within 10min walking distance to Universal Studios.,1
The staff was very friendly and helpful!  The hotel was very nice| probably one of the best hotels we've ever stayed in.  Clean| safe| close to Universal and the breakfast was really good!,1
Trip to Universal Studios; very convenient,1
Wouldn't expect it but this property has some kinda bed bugs.  Staff at the front desk were rude| exceptionally rude during the two interactions I had with them.  Not what I expect from a Hilton.  Unacceptable for the amount of money charged.   They just lost a customer for life.,0
our trip was great and a 7 minute walk to city walk can't be beat.,1
Room was clean| spacious and comfortable. Staff were friendly and helpful. Chose this hotel because of location to Universal with shuttle service every 15 minutes,1
Very nice hotel. I only dislike you have to pay to park at a hotel you are staying at. The breakfast buffet price was higher than other Hilton hotels I have stayed at.,1
The housekeeping staff was excellent. The pool was small.,1
Proximity to Universal is top notch and property is well kept,1
Great location close to Universal Studios theme park. Very nice and helpful staff and very accommodating. We enjoyed our stay.,1
Proximity to the Universal Studios and it was clean.,0
Close to universal city. No airport shuttle| had to make own arrangements.,1
We loved it .,1
Great view and room service menu was awesome! Really impressive service!,1
Room smells| complained and asked for room to be deodorised next day| still not good. Noisy water pipes at night. Walking access to Universal Studios could be improved.,0
Great Place to stay in LA. Everyone were very welcoming .,1
We enjoyed our two nights stay at the Hilton as always.  The room is super clean all the staff are very friendly and accommodating.,1
‚ÄúCorner Room (Universal View)‚Äù implies a view. In fact the room was on floor 2| one level below the lobby level| and the only view was of an access road behind the hotel. Water temperature in the bathroom sink was extremely difficult to adjust. The cold water tap put out hot water and the hot water tap put out VERY hot water. It took awhile to figure out that you had to run the cold water about 30 seconds before it cooled down| then you had to open the cold tap all the way and crack the hot tap just slightly; anything else would produce scalding hot water. I've never seen anything like it.,0
This hotel was amazing.  We stayed one night for HHN at Universal Studios across the street.  It's clean| the lady at the front desk was super nice| check-in was quick and parking was easy to find.  Not to mention| the hotel is also a convenient and fast walk to Universal Studios which was my main reason for staying here.  My only gripe is the elevator going down to the parking garage was in the hallway to the ballroom| which made it very awkward having to walk through a convention full of people with our luggage in tow| but I'm only nitpicking.,1
The staff were friendly and frofessional. The room was exceptionally clean and the grounds are well kept and maintained. The courtesy shuttle to and from Universal Studios was a plus. Beware| there is a parking fee of $30| a bit steep in my opinion but still worth the stay.,1
Well appointed hotel rooms with courteous and helpful staff. A bonus that you can leave your luggage with them after checkout so as to explore LA before a late flight.,1
Great location. Staff helpful. Awesome seafood buffet,1
Loved the hotel and location. Staff very friendly and helpful and appreciated the shuttle and houra run. My only complaint is the room had  a dampness smell. Not sure if it was the carpet or bathroom.,1
Wonderful being right across the street from Universal Studios| only a 5-8 min walk| also| courteous staff| very clean property except for some room construction right beside our room| and some plumbing issues.Beds were comfortable| room service was excellent.,1
Room was fantastic. Service was excellent. Location was perfect. For the second part of our honeymoon| this location fit our needs in every way. The pillows were so awesome I contemplated asking where they get them from! Literally like sleeping on a cloud. We were fortunate enough to get the newly renovated 5th floor. There were some unsightly things like the carpet not being properly cut to the wall all the way and some chipped paint in the room but otherwise we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves here.,1
Very convenient location. The room was large and comfortable.,1
Great visit. Food and service needs help. Brought wrong food at lunch| wrong juice at room service. Otherwise nice,1
I love everything about it except paying for parking.,1
We've stayed at this hotel several times over the past years. The staff was exceptional on this visit. My husband and I were celebrating his birthday and they brought up cake and strawberries as a treat for him. The room was excellent| comfortable and the view was exactly as I had requested. In the past the hotel has been under various  types of renovation and it was hard to get around and I thought that the staff was a little harried.  This visit was quite magical. The check in process was smooth| the bellhops held onto our bags until our room was ready (we were there early in the morning and spent the day at universal studios)| the restaurant staff was pleasant and seemingly at our beck and call.,1
The only drawback I would say would be the price of everything from room service to the onsite restaurant was super expensive.,1
Loved the shuttle to Universal Studios.  Hotel was beautiful. Staff was friendly and efficient.,1
Awesome stay at Hilton.  Comfortable beds and great bathroom.,1
We changed rooms 3 times. The first time it was so noisy from the laundry and the lifts going up and down. Second room the fold out bed was so old and uncomfortable it was impossible to sleep on. The third room was ok but small. We were provided with a free breakfast for our troubles which was appreciated but overall the experience didn't match the price paid.,0
cards next to phone with instructions mark with a O ring on it from previous customer drinks| suggested to be replace or cleaned.,1
Nice hotel with convenient access to Universal Studios and City Walk.  Nest part was the shuttle service to/from Universal.,1
The hotel is nice and a short walk to Universal Studios.  The room| however| smelled liked mildew.  It was horrible.   There was no fan in the shower and the room windows would steam up whenever anyone took a shower.   The lack of bathroom ventilation might be why the entire room smelled like mildew and mold.   We were only staying 2 nights| but would not book this hotel again due to the odor.,0
We were on the 17th floor and our view was amazing. The room was roomy with a king bed and couch as well as a small desk. The bathroom had a shower and tub| but the plug didnt work so i was dissappointed when i tried to take a bath. There were stains on the carpet and the shower curtain that were offputting. But overall a good experience and very convenient for going to Universal Studios.,1
The hotel is pretty pricey unfortunately it doesn't include parking other then that it's a nice hotel and the housekeeping is great!,1
Great rooms| great views| great location for Universal Studios,1
Excellent all around!!,1
Nothing special at all for the price. Waited 35 minuets in line to check in. Horrible view| stained carpet| at least the bed was decently comfortable. Over all maybe a 2.5 star.,1
Hotel is nice however water preassure very low on shower and no fan in restroom.,1
I loved how close it was to the park. It was clean and nicely decorated. The bed was comfortable and the sheets weresoft. The kids next door to us were loud which is understandable but the gap under the door between our rooms was too big and let all the noise in. I was also sad there wasn't a bathtub. I guess that's what hotels are doing now‚Äîputting in big showers. Very nice place though and I would stay there again.,1
We checked out and went to the restaurant for breakfast| that ended at 11am. the only option was a $60 per person!!!!! buffet. That's more than any high end hotel in Las Vegas.  Had we known| we would have ordered room service and it would have been a 1/3 the price!  They also get you for $28 a night parking.,1
Hotel was really nice. Customer service was amazing! I would go back just based on that. Universal Studios was a 10min walk from the hotel with a small hill to walk up going to and from the park. They also have a shuttle but it gets super full during peek times(park opening/ closing/ Horror Nights). Room was pretty spacious and the bathroom was huge. I would definitely recommend staying here if you plan on going to Universal or if you just want a really friendly and amazing hotel.,1
Overall i really loved this hotels location| design| customer service and amenities. We visited just for 1 night to attend Hollywood Horror Nights 9/29/18. Although my neice and I experienced a couple of minor hiccups in service| it was promptly corrected. The first hiccup was....Upon arrival of any hotel I pull of sheets and inspect the mattress| i found some small stains on some of the sheets. I called the front desk and asked if they could change the sheets. They apologized and asked if i would like to change rooms. I said changing the sheets would suffice. Within 20 minutes a housekeeper came to change the sheets. The second hiccup was when we arrived back to our room around 2:30am from the event I ordered ice cream on the overnight menu by way of the TV ordering service. The TV indicated that it would arrive within 30 minutes. We waited up over an hour and the ice cream never arrived. When i checked out i wanted to verify that i wasnt charged for something i never received| the front desk said I was not....and on their end it doesnt show i ordered anything. The front desk employee was very apologetic and offered me a $20 voucher to their coffee cafe. I really appreciated the overall concern with these minor issues. My neice and I enjoyed the property and will definitely make it our go to hotel when visiting Universal in the future!,1
Very clean. The rooms| front desk area and the outside was meticulously clean. My only complaint is $30 for breakfast buffet that was seriously bland and not a lot of options.,1
Room clean| fast check in. Was even able to check in early. Awesome service.,1
I received a message with concerns of my room. Never experienced that before I was very pleased and appreciated the concern.,1
Location was great.   Concierge was fantastic (Jesse). Shuttle was good and availability was great,1
Overall I would give this hotel a 6 outta 10. Yes the service is great of course it's the Hilton. But as for the room itself not the best. The bed and bedding was very nice but in general the a/c didn't work that great. The remote for the TV sucked and water pressure was horrible not to mention the hot water did not get that hot. I definitely expected more.,1
Great location| there's a shuttle to Universal city. For those who come for the movie magic experience- look no further,1
The pool and the hot tub were amazing. It's so close to universal studios. The room service was impeccable. Brought us a full set table with flowers and all.,1
The room was extremely clean with comfortable beds.,1
Can't get any closer to Universal!  Friendly staff| some great views.,1
Was an amazing hotel and the service was amazing.....hubby hates to spend the money on hotels but after staying here I don't think I will be able to make him stay anywhere else. He was very impressed,1
Super friendly staff| got an upgraded room and happy with our stay!  Tim was amazing‚Äîwhat a great guy!,1
Great staff very friendly will definitely be returning to the Hilton,1
Front desk Stuff not friendly at all| need more smiles and I don't feel welcome and very time I ask questions| she always negative.,0
Very clean hotel located close to the park. Staff was friendly and accommodating. We had a great view of the park from our room. Definitely will come back our next trip to universal.,1
Nice hotel. great staff. Great location for Hollywood tours.,1
Great hotel in excellent location to universal studios and the metro. Room was very clean and comfortable. Would recommend staying here.,1
Staff members were really friendly and helpful. The room was nice and neat.,1
Linda was a absolute delight.  Rooms are big.,1
Everything and everyone was extremely great. And tried to accommodate me.,1
Very friendly| great service| lovely pool| fun room service menu,1
Great Location| friendly staff| 5 Star!,1
a lot of room but poorly designed. missing a lot of things| e.g. hooks to hang bath towels| not enough room for hangers. The USB charging ports did not work.,1
friendly staff and great service,1
My wife and I stayed at this hotel for four nights to see Universal and the Hollywood area.  We stayed in an Executive level room| which I highly recommend because if comes with a great continental breakfast| which normally runs $20 per person.  The hotel was clean and the staff friendly.  The service around the pool seemed to focus strictly on the cabanas which made it hard to get a drink.,1
Great Location!! Close to Universal Studios.. shuttle to and from the park which is a plus... we flew to Burbank... we Lyfted to the hotel.. warm welcome from staff.. great job!! Breakfast buffet was great... good selection for $20... thank you..,1
Excellent location and staff very professional. Room very clean and nice,1
Water station is convenient| friendly staff| clean rooms. We enjoyed our stay!,1
Very friendly staff!! Very expensive. No continental breakfast no free wifi no free coffee. A bit disappointed in the high costs. However the staff is excellent| super friendly and eager to assist. Just be prepared to pay!,1
Staff outstanding. Proximity to park and shuttle service great.,1
| best Hotel to stay esp if you plan to visit Citywalk| Universal Studio | best view too!,1
The pool was great!  Comfy rooms.  Had issues with the TV remote even after they replaced it.,1
The Hilton is the closest hotel to Universal Park| which is about a 5-10 minute walk| but they do have a shuttle. Rooms are big and comfortable| staff is nice| and they have a $25 early check-in option available for early arrivers. My only slight complaint| and it's not with the hotel| but when using Lyft| the Hilton is not an option - it's always the main entrance to Universal| which gets a little annoying if you use Lyft frequently on the trip.,1
Hotel was great. I wish they had information easily available about the shuttle. And about nearby restaurants. Other than that it was amazing.,1
Loved how convenient this location was to Universal Hollywood and city walk. So easy to walk and safe. We were upgraded to a corner room with a beautiful view of the hillside homes and sunsets! Room was very spacious and bed comfortable. Only complaint would be if you planned on having pool time they had a limited amount of lounge chairs.,1
Close to Universal Studios Hollywood. Very good view from room.,1
When we called front desk to get some one to clean the room no ones showed up either day  asked for towels never got them. Was trying to leave the parking lot and the gate card wasn't working so I waited 30-40 min in the garage some one came to help but they were no help so they had to get someone else to get it to open,0
Very nice and right accross from universal studios.,1
Shuttle bus from Universal finishes at 9pm for some reason| however an easy ten minute walk.,1
Stayed for a trip to Universal Studios. This hotel is fantastic! Staff was so welcoming and friendly! Our room was clean and comfortable and had a great view of the park. And of course it's so convienent being that close to the park. We would love to stay here again!,1
We only stayed for one night passing from the coast to Vegas. The hotel was easy to find| rooms were large and comfortable with a great coffee machine. Pool area was lovely. Handy for Universal studios and the Citywalk was great for restaurants and shops.,1
Nice hotel. But confusing the parking. Why cannot use wifi for free,1
Excellent service from staff| very helpful with all our needs. View was amazing from our room. Had a great time..will definitely come back to stay.,1
Very convenient to go the Universal Studios. Shuttle bus available to bring parent on wheelchair. Last shuttle pick up 9pm from City Walk.,1
Loved the concierge service from Jesse| about how to plan the visit to Universal Park!,1
This hotel was $386 a night and didn't even include breakfast.  Drinks by the pool were over $20 a piece and contained nothing but mixers.  It was so bad i sent them back.  Decided to take my kids to breakfast for$30 a plate in the hotel.  It was nothing but oatmeal|  bread| cereal|  a few things that looked microwaved.  I had much higher expectations for the Hilton,0
It is a perfect choice if you plan on spending most of your time at Universal Studios. I was able to save on parking and walk for most of my stay. They have a shuttle that drops you off at City Walk so even if you don't spend the day at the park| you have plenty of options for entertainment and food.,1
Check in staff was great very helpful and efficient. Room was beautiful| clean and in good repair although the bed was very firm. Be clear about the breakfast option| the universal breakfast buffet was $30.00 a head for pretty standard buffet| in fairness we should have asked about the price| but we're a bit shocked when we were presented a bill for $100 + tax  for a small breakfast for 3. Overall a nice hotel.,1
Great to stay and easy 5 min walk to universal | rooms are very clean and the bed is super comfy |  coffee shop and restaurant is available onsite | check in was super easy and fast,1
Good hotel| walking distance to Universal Studios and City Walk. Only downfall $28 + tax for daily parking if you have a rental.,1
We liked the corner room and comfy bed.We didn't like the price of the adult buffet.  One can only eat so much in one sitting....though the food WAS delicious.,1
Great stay great breakfast,1
Our stay went very well. The staff were professional in every way. The hotel was in an excellent location to what we were doing. The room and grounds were very clean at all times. I would recommend the hotel to anyone who wants a clean and well kept place. They might just see a movie star there as I did. The place is a plus!,1
I was checking staff was friendly and more helpful I would have loved it if the room had a microwave,1
Wouk got recommend it. Good location and very good facilities. Staff very friendly.,1
I enjoy very much.The staff was great and the food delicious.,1
"Do not stay at the Hilton unless you can afford the executive suites. If you're not staying in the executive floors| the staff pretends to care and ""make it right"" but ultimately doesnt care and the problems dont get fixed. We had very low water pressure in our room and the beds had ""body groves"" in them (similar to a but grove in a chair you've had for a long time). They attempt to hide this by using a mattress padding cover instead of just replacing the mattresses. I notified the front desk of our problems and they couldnt move us claiming the hotel was fully booked. I made several complaints to multiple different front desk staff but ultimately| nothing was done. This terrible experience soured our vacation at Universal Studios as we just didnt feel comfortable or taken care of as you would expect from a 1st class hotel. I asked for a refund and was only given one free day of parking and told no refunds since we booked through expedia. I did purchase travel insurance but Im pretty sure that wont help either. Our stay totally sucked. Never staying with Hilton again... EVER! :(",0
Staff was friendly and helpful   My room was very clean spacious and had a beautiful view | I enjoyed my stay| highly recommended this hotel| not very far from sightseeing activities. Will definitely stay at this hotel againMy view was not clear because the windows were very dirty| they were in the process of cleaning the windows,1
A very neat hotel!,1
If you go to Universal Studios buy express pass to all prior to your visit on internet (sheeper) or in the lobby (more expensive) at the hotel in high seasons| which gives you one express entr√© to each attraction once.,1
Parking fee is also high. Not recommended !!,0
It's ok and the hotel near Universal Studio.,1
It was okay. The carpet wasn't clean when we checked in and the next day around 0900 somebody was hammering already and woke up my kids.,1
Great stay from start to finish!  Great staff| eager to help| great bed and excellent mattress!  I could not complain about anything if I tried!,1
Nice and cozy hotel| everything was clean| great customer service.,1
Everything needed was within a rock's throw away,1
One of the check in staff was rude and abrupt. Both check in employees evidently didn't know how to check in or find third party bookings. The guy who checked me in bothered to investigate and find out but it was evident had he not done so other customers would not have been checked in. Rude. Colored the experience as first point of contact.,0
We liked over looking the beach,1
It was a wonderful hotel overall! The only thing that was negative was that all of the food onsite was overpriced- other than that the room was great| bed and pillows were comfortable| and the staff were all really nice!,1
Location perfect ! Close to the parks and lots of restaurants and stores walking distance - staff super friendly- we would stay here again - thank you !,1
The room located on the pool deck was great,1
I was honestly expecting more from a Hilton| especially one right next to the Convention Center. Pros: Nice lobby. Huge gym. Splash play area for kids. Starbucks downstairs. Cons: Parking is $24 a night and is not included. My room had several issues: a leaking bathtub faucet| the dresser drawers did not stay closed| horrible pillows| an alarm clock with a loud non-adjustable beep| a towel rack inside of the shower| and a loud sliding bathroom door. Also the walls were thin and we could almost everything going on in the room next to us. We were woken up in the morning by an unidentified tapping sound on the window which was not coming from our room. The indoor pool was closed and there was no notification about this on the website. This was the main reason we picked this hotel to begin with.,0
We were blessed with a room at the very far end on the 12th floor. It gave us extra sitting room| which was perfect for my girls! We absolutely LOVE this hotel and can't wait to go back!!!,1
Very clean and beautiful hotel. Professional and helpful staff with any questions.,1
Over priced| out dated| mold in shower| was moved right away next room shower handles ready to fall off... below expectations for price,0
Overall was convenient to walk to Disney (about a 20 min walk). Room was spacious and we had a great view of the theme parks. One negative was the room bathroom size| it could only accommodate one person at a time; while this worked for us as a couple| it would definitely be challenging for a small family who may have to get children ready.,1
This place is gross| old and out of date. Stay at the Marriott across the convention drive or anywhere else. I was so disappointed in the hotel itself| the food and the very small| dirty looking pool. Never again.,0
When we arrived to our room the refrigerator did not work and the sink wouldn't drain. We called the front desk immediately and was upgraded to to a poolside view. The staff was friendly .,1
Ive stayed here each summer for many years| never had a problem. This year was down right disgusting. The backroom door handle was broken| the bath tub plug was missing. They never changed the sheets| only made the bed. Left dirty cups on the counter| left dirty towel on the ground. Didnt always replace the bag to get ice. Called for more towels they took a hour to come up.,0
Staff was super friendly and helpful,1
The hotel was nice but the room was really small.,1
Convenient and clean hotel! My family and I were comfortable and within walking distance of Disney and restaurants.,1
Great place to stay and amazing experience,1
It was cool,1
Great hotel in a good location.  Very clean and staff was very accommodating.,1
A very lovely hotel with respectful| friendly staff. Great pool and water park for kids. We felt safe staying here. There is an actual starbucks in the hotel| ling lines but so convinient. The food court and restaurants were closed during our stay| so we were not able to order food services. On the 5th floor there is a pool and grill restaurant/bar with lounging available while kids play in the water park. Definitely coming back!,1
Food court closed too early,1
It was very disappointing the we had to pay $100 just to park in the hotel..   rooms were not clean when we arrive.. beds were not comfortable and blankets felt itchy. I do not recommend this place.,0
Staff was very friendly| overall clean rooms other than stains on floor. Pool area was way better than expected. Our vehicle was too high to park in the self parking lot. This was an added expense to pay for valet.  Our family will definitely stay here again.,1
I love the room it was nice and spacious for my family the outside pool was nice my kids love it. The Fitness center was ok i only say ok because the Basketball court and other gym and indoor pool was closed. Other than that it was a great experience üëç,1
The rooms were really clean and our kids had a great time in the pool. When we booked our rooms we purchased a breakfast buffet. Upon arrival we were told there was no buffet and we would be given a credit for food and beverages. There was only 1 restaurant and starbucks  open. The lines to these businesses were really long and were imposible to use our credit. If the buffet is not available why do they make it an option for purchase when booking.  The indoor pool was also closed,1
Very clean| and comfortable. We stayed 5 nights and came back to a clean restocked room every day.,1
Family friendly hotel. Always a bunch of cheerleaders there having competitions at the convention center.,1
Very friendly and welcoming service| room was clean| bed was comfortable| overall was a great experience.,1
Reasonable price| good service| close to Disney.  My kids had a good time,1
Glasses all over my hallway for days |no breakfast available |rooms needs a little update |high price for the service,0
Pretty close to Disneyland. Walking distance,0
I would have preferred that the restaraunt in hotel stayed open a little later,1
The place has nice lobby| compare to marriot across the street. However|  I have to change the room twice| as 1st room had bad bathroom| 2nd room was very dirty. All rooms were very dirty| property rooms are not clean| showers tiny and dirty| toilet does not flush.We paid over $250/per night was too much for this kind of property.,0
Everything was perfect.,1
The pictures make it look very nice and  new and clean. However| It is a older hotel and you can tell by the rooms. Holes in the carpet and bed was leaning one way. The parking garage was full so we couldn't even park there so we had to park across the street. No problem with parking elsewhere but the hotel should comp you for that at least| since they cant accommodate us.,0
Loved the place but the sheets on the bed had blood stains,1
The Staff was friendly and the place was clean. It is very convenient for Disney or events at the convention center!,1
I got disappointed with the Hilton Anaheim| hotel wasn't clean| room facility was to cheap| customer service was poor| parking spaces are to small and is like the Hotel wasn't ready to get guests.,0
The pool was not that clean,1
I like the little kids water park. My kids had a lot of fun in the pool area,1
the property was clean| comfortable| safe| and convenient. the amenities were good and the staff was professional. would definitely stay there again.,1
The room was not clean. I reached to make my coffee in the morning N felt,0
The hotel in the common areas was beautiful. The hot tub was not hot enough and seems to be chipping on the floor and where you sit. The rooms were average nothing amazing| the bathrooms could use an update. The beds were comfortable.,1
The rooms are a bit outdated so the only suggestion I have is to upgrade them.  Other than that everything and all the staff were great.,1
Amenities where great staff was rude did not care at all.  Poor poor customer service by multiple staff,0
Amazing stay and wonderful staff.,1
Our stay was amazing. The arrival was so easy. Valet was immediately available for our car and staff took our luggage straight up to our room. Once we got up to our room we noticed the clean and fresh room. We dined at the restaurant on the first floor and it was delicious. The only thing that would have made this stay better was an allergy friendly option for their Mickey Mouse waffles.,1
Absolutely loved the stay| close to Disney!,1
It is a great property. We spent a day at the pool. I have to say the water was murky and very very dirty| floating hair and other debris.  It is a shame because otherwise it would have been the perfect vacation,0
Since we got there they had trouble looking for our room it doesn't look like the pictures indoor pool was close in my room there was no fridge we had to use my family's other room not what I expected,0
Rug was really dirty with some sticky spots that stuck to your foot. AC unit was loud and came on repeatedly throughout the night even when thermostat was up or off! Really long hallways & no luggage carts available without a bell hop. Parking is OK at $24/day| but Wifi costs $12/day! Toilet clogged quickly & took hours to get it plunged. No microwave| which is odd for this type of hotel. They need a serious remodel/cleaning & a policy review.,0
The hotel's lobby was very clean| all the workers were very friendly. The hotels location was great| right next to Disneyland. In addition| I opted for the Valet service| the valet were always out with my car in under 5 minutes| sometimes closer to 2 minutes and very friendly as well. I requested a room with a view of Disneyland| for an added cost of course| and was placed on the top level with a direct view of Disney| this made it perfect for watching the fireworks come night time. I will be staying here againüëç,1
Our suite was great! The only recommendation would be a fan in the bathroom and a microwave. Other than that| it was perfect!,1
Great and friendly customer service,1
I'll start by saying that I appreciate the fact that this hotel is within walking distance of Disneyland| restaurants| and stores. That was great! But that could be said about the majority of hotels in Anaheim. Now to the criticism.....I must say that I am disappointed with the condition of this Hilton property. The room was outdated. The door handle into the bathroom was broken and it was quite clear nobody made a good attempt to repair it in several years. There was a weird leak coming from the roof of the shower. There was another leak in the hallway that was not repaired the entire time of my stay. Instead| they laid towels on the floor. Very tacky. For this to be a large Hilton property| I expected more. They should close the hotel for remodeling just like the nearby Sheraton.,0
"The hotel is beautiful. My complaint is the parking attendant. I had forgotten my room key in the room when I went to check out (my fault) and had checked out via their text service. When I went to leave the parking lot and realized I needed my key| I pushed the button to speak to staff. I told them what happened and they didn't say ""hold on a minute"" or anything like that| they just hung up on me. I wasn't quite sure what was happening so after a minute I called again. That's when Cynthia was walking up and said she was ""I'm already here"". Her demeanor was cold and aggressive. She told me I had to go back and get the key or show a receipt. I figured there must be another way| so I showed her my text message for check-out and my room number| but she said she couldn't take it. I happened to check my email and had an emailed receipt from Hilton and she said she already had it. She did let me go after a little wait| but she was so rude about it. It really bothered me since I paid a lot to stay the night| and it was my birthday| so it started my day off negative. There was really no need for her attitude| there was no line behind me| and I was polite to her. I hope this is addressed. She does not seem like she belongs working at a nice hotel.",0
I will not stay in this property again - partly my fault and partly theirs. Partly my fault because I realized I just don't like resorts - too far to get to the rooms| too far to get to parking| easy to get lost| etc. I just prefer simpler accommodations. What was their fault was the inability to fix the fridge in my room - I either called or talked to someone three times and nothing was ever done. Every time they assured me someone would come look at it and nothing happened - not even a call or follow-up to see if I was happy. I'd never stayed in a Hilton before and thought the name was synonymous with impeccable standards. My mistake.,0
Great hotel.  It is super busy with Disney but we didn't have a problem.  We had a room where we could see the fireworks from Disney.  The pool was warm with a play area for the kids.  Would stay there again,1
Staff is super nice. 15 minute walk with kids. Kind of far my kids were super tired after spending all day at Disney. The hotel needs a good renovation. First room we got had a leak in the bathroom sink| called downstairs n quickly got moved to another room. I would not stayed here again. Closer walk to Disneyland next time.,1
The room smelled like smoke. There were water leaks and everything was stained. The once beautiful is in need of major upgrades. I won't be staying there until they upgrade their facility.,0
No room service| stains on the wall| chips on the furniture| small TV| $80. For a breakfast of 2 ‚Ä¶ me and my 7 year old. Shuttle service confusing have to download an app. Very disappointing for a Hilton.,0
A little outdated and the halls had a moldy/urine smell,1
There is a shuttle right across the street for Disneyland.. If it had been cooler we would have walked the 15-20 min| but it was so hot outside. The Hotel was nice and air conditioned. Starbucks on site. Many of the food options were closed but still had the restaurant and used Doordash to deliver from local.  It was clean and the pool was wonderful| nice pool/play area for little kids. Felt very safe traveling with my 10 year old alone.,1
I was very disappointed our phone and tv was not working. The bathroom tub has molded mildew on the lining.  The room smelled musty And the refrigerator had a ice as thick as 3inches of ice .  I actually took pictures of our hotel room.. We travel do much that this is the first time I have been upset..the amount of money that I paid for a good hotel . Hilton is not worth the money I paid for.,0
Clean place Staff was really friendly,1
I booked this hotel because it had great ratings and looked nice. We arrived at about 7:30 pm to check in to valet and was told to come back in 4 hrs or use self parking. Once we got our room the fridge was unplugged and we had to pull it out from a cabinet to connect it.  Fast forward to bedtime| the bathroom has a beeping sound that doesnt stop no matter what we did and the air vents in the room rattled so bad we got no sleep! Such a horrible experience|  it was so late ans we were already unpacked and tired I didnt want to go down|stand in the long elevator and check in lines and ask for another room,0
It was all good,1
Good hotel! Enjoyed our stay. Daily room service is back and we loved getting our beds made and fresh towels. Beds were comfy. Great location by convention center and dining places. On the down side| I could hear every word the people above us said. Not a big deal most of the time except in the early morning. Parking was close and we had easy access but was expensive. Would stay here again.,1
Area was nice and friendly,1
The hotel was nice but we had issues with lights in our bathroom being out the entire time and no one came to fix it and the people next to us where smoking marijuana! Which was great so smell all night!,1
Love that this hotel is within walking distance of parks and restaurants.  The pool is rather small and crowded.,1
Dirty| outdated| stained sheets| residue in refrigerator| crowded pool| $30 valet parking| $24 self park| really bad experience.,0
The room is outdated compared to a time share facilities.,1
It is a nice hotel but the room is a little outdated and it smelled a little stale when we walked in. The lovby and downstairs is nice.  Check in and check out was easy.,1
Amazing location within walking of Disney. Hotel lobby was perfect.  My room was a little shabby.  Water damage on the shower ceiling|  old fixtures.  The room was high volume usage  for sure. Overall all I just showed and slept there as I spent all day in Disney.  Would stay again for the location.,1
Clean room| clean comfortable bed| plush towels| refrigerator in the room.,1
It was very clean. Over the phone the staff wasn't so helpful but in person the clerk was very sweet.,1
The beds and pillows were very comfortable. The service at the bar/restarant was great!,1
Perfect hotel to visit the parks! It is clean| convenient and close to everything!,1
From the lobby you would think the rooms had been updated. They have not; not my normal Hilton standard. The tub was peeling in the bathroom and the wall paper was peeling in the room. The drapes and carpet have not been updated. However| the employees were very nice and accommodating.,1
Regret booking a one night stay here. I had previously stayed at the Hilton back in 2014-2015 and apparently nothing has changed. The elevator feels like it's going to give out on you any second. There is water damage in the bathrooms. Literally bubbles of water above the bathtub. The hotel looks depressing and run down. The floor is super uneven and the carpets disgustingly dirty. We had a 2 night stay at the Westin prior to staying for one last minute night at the Hilton and wish I had spent 4x the price to stay at the Westin because at least the Westin felt safe and clean. Nothing against the employees here as they are trying to do their best with what they have but I will say they could be a bit more accommodating as well.,0
Place is horrible the dam fridge in the room kept me and my family up all night the motor to the fridge is loud. When we first got here the staff let a Karen cut the line in which we waited for check about 20mins walking in the hallway to get to the room and dry wall was literally falling from the ceiling. Definitely not like the Hilton's I'm used to staying in. Do not recommend and will definitely not stay here should have booked the double tree down the road.,0
We had booked for 2 nights more than a month in advance  and our reservation was cancelled just a day before our check-in because they OVER-BOOKED. Huh..wasn't our fault. Never going to trust them again,0
Lots of elevators and they are fast. Within walking distance to Disney entrance. Nice lobby with a Starbucks. Room was nice and clean. Staff were all friendly. Early check in only cost $25. The only negatives were there isn't a free shuttle to the park| no free WiFi unless you are a Hilton member| and the ice machine near our room was broken for the 4 days we were there. Overall I would highly recommend.,1
The rooms were out dated| my 1st room had bugs in the bathroom. So the gave me a balcony which it was really spacious| the only wired thing about it| the out side had carpet. The wallpaper was pealing. My family and I loved that we made memories| we wished it wasn't at this hotel.,0
I like the fact the manager did her job and made us comfortable. What i did nit like is paying for parking in a parking garage that was owned by Hilton it was very expensive and parking should be free if your paying for a room that cost over $150.00 a night to stay and they need more disabled parking for the disabled like one level just for disabled. Its not ok that we have to wheel far to get to an elevator with a wheelchair thats the only down fall but they should be like the airpirt where its just for disabled. Free parking for disabled..,1
I liked that it was convenient.  However the room was dirty especially the bathroom and towels.  It was noisy in the hallway hard to get a good night sleep.,0
The staff| particularly guest services were extremely helpful and responsive.,1
Very nice staff| and nice and clean hotel overall. However the room's AC was very loud when set at very cool temp| it could have used a couple of minor repairs in bathroom| the tv could've been bigger and smart with access to netflix and such| and there was no microwave unless paying $35 per stay.  Also| on-site parking was a bit expensive.  There were amenities we didn't use nor care for| such as gym| spa| and bar.  Also there is a convenient bus stop at the middle of this and Marriott's main entrances which had multiple lines including to the Disney Parks; however the service was not as efficient as they required multiple apps to get and use tickets| had no regular schedule| and it would take a long time to leave as people would struggle scanning their digital tickets one by one.,1
Friendly and accommodating staff. Hotel upkeep not so much hot and scolding hot shower| moved rooms then had to deal with a clogged sink in the new room| room lock batteries also died so had to wait for it to be replaced. Dirty pillows| our had blood stains on them| so did the sheets they had some yellow stains| had to wait for these to be replaced before going to bed. Not to mention room also had some dirty socks/ underwear left on the floor which tells me how well the room was cleaned.,0
Nice hotel| was clean and quiet. A bit of a walk from elevators to some of the rooms| and a long walk to Disneyland.,1
"Our room was quite nice with a a fair amount of natural light from a large bay window. The bed was comfortable| the shower head was higher than most (we're both tall people) and the desk/table rolled out| which was nice for us as we travel with board and card games to pass the time. Our refrigerator frequently and loudly made popping and clicking noises that startled us both in the middle of the night. Checking out proved confusing at first as well. The ""Zip Out"" checkout button on the phone went to a full voicemail box. Additionally| despite on-screen instructions to use a menu button on the TV's remote| there was no such functionality. It wasn't until we spoke to guest relations on the way out that we learned of the texting-based check out and one posted sign in the lobby| rather than info provided during check-in or information left in the room with instructions.",1
Everything was great except customer service with some a vallet workers,1
We had two false fire alarms go off during the times we were sleeping. Was very frustrating especially with having a kid who has a condition with epilepsy and a stressful situations don't help.,0
The rooms need a little updating (furniture needs more charging outlets)| and no vent in bathroom for steam.,1
Restaurant is not open and there is no in room dining.  Only place to get food onsite is at the bar w a very limited menu or Starbucks which is not even open all day. The room smelled like smoke and the water never got hot in the shower.,0
The hotel was closed for 14 months as it was reopened a few weeks back due to Covid. The room was dusty even though they claimed it was cleaned. Overall| the staff is hands down| AMAZING. Super friendly and gave us a room with a nice view. The parking is on the expensive side but expected due to the location. Overall| the price we paid was worth it. Remember| the staff is working super hard so make sure to thank them :),1
I like the lighting nice relaxing ambience and the retro feel.,1
Well at the Hilton I would like to say the registration lady Britney was over and beyond on excellent customer service I could write her if she would be a five thank you for your service,1
The hotel was clean| the staff was very friendly| and I liked that they had a parking garage. The rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable. The room was dated and in need of an update.,1
Great amenities for the children,1
Booked a 2 night stay for a larger room.  Was told for the 2nd night| that they didn't have the room available so we'd have to check out from first room and check into a 2nd room.  There was a 4 hr wait in between since it was a big inconvenience.,0
Hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. Room was clean and the person who came in and cleaned our room did an amazing job.,1
Everything was easy peasy when getting there. The staff was friendly and the place was clean! Even with Covid restrictions| the pool was open for on the guest staying and majority of it amenities! The breakfast is not a buffet but you can still order food. Overall| great experience!,1
As soon as we checked into our room we noticed in the bathroom that the shower handle was off and sitting on the side of the bathtub I called the front desk and told them and they said they would send someone up| they never did. Luckily the shower handle worked if we held it in place to start the shower | but it would fall off after.,1
Easy access to lobby from parkinglot. Good signage so you didn't get lost. We were there for something at the convention center| which was very close too! Thank you. Side Comment: Expedia would only let us cancel the reservation 48 hours out from our date of stay| whereas the hotel would have let us cancel 24 hours out. So beware of the cancellation time. The hotel cannot alter your reservation if it is made thru Expedia.,1
This is a very nice hotel to stay in however with summer almost here the crowds are coming out I had Tom put up with people talking loud I. The hallways running all over the place people banging their doors had no respect for people who just wanted to wind down and relax would I stay here again yes but on a much higher floor where there is quiet thank you,1
The rooms need an update first hotel I ever gone too where they charge you 35 bucks for a microwave ! The carpets are dirty the fridge never got cold got a new one SAME issue the hotel is too dark looks depressing.,0
Clean roomComfy bed Good walking distance to Disneyland,1
When we got to the hotel we were told that they no longer had our room available. The young lady was very nice and found us an alternative. The view was nice but I do not think that the room had been dusted or vacuumed since they were closed| sheets  had not been refreshed and the towels were probably the same ones that sat in the bathroom while they remained closed. They smelled musty. Overall| not what I expected. Pool is very small and when you stay at a hotel that large you would think the amenities would be reflective| they are not. When I checked out received an emailed receipt and I was charged 3 days of parking| when I did not have car and used Uber. The person that I spoke to reversed the charges| but did not explain why I was charged. Had I not reviewed my receipt would have been charged for something we did not use. Just not sure how I feel overall about this hotel.,0
Very convenient/close to Disneyland. Good food.,1
Great restaurant and bar. Rooms are comfortable. Only downside is the long walk to Disneyland especially at the end of the day. Staff were very helpful and knowledgeable.,1
Parking system very confusing,1
First of all I didnt know I had to pay 21.00 to park and then you have a long way to walk from the parking to the hotell.  The room is in poor shape| the tv is outdated. I wont ever stay here again,0
I chose to stay at this hotel since it was close to Disneyland. The lobby looked amazing when checking in. I felt like I was in a high-class hotel. The elevators to the parking garage brought me directly to the lobby. The reception staff was helpful and nice. I had an issue with neighbors smoking in an adjacent room which staff promptly fixed. The lobby had a Starbucks inside of it which was great for a quick breakfast| however| they charged several dollars extra for items which made the process expensive. When I saw the room I was slightly disappointed by the quality. The bathroom door ( which slides closed like a closet door) was sticking against the carpet. The bed was squeaky and the pillows felt cheap. Using one pillow and my head was on the mattress. Using two pillows kept my head at an uncomfortable incline. The mini-fridge in the room kept my bottled waters at a slightly chilled temperature. The water pressure in the room was low but comfortable. Based on my three-day stay| I would rate the front of the hotel and the lobby as a 5 out of 5. Sadly| I would rate the room as a 3 out of 5. I hope the Hilton would put more effort into the rooms as they did the lobby.,0
Nice hotel with friendly staff. Great job cleaning the rooms maybe just needs a little updating. Heated pool was great and there was a fun water slide.,1
My family and I stayed here to have a Disney weekend| and it was just okay. The hotel looks very nice on the outside| but the room could use remodeling/upgrading. First| my hotel door did not have a sticker of the room having been cleaned as I saw on other doors when walking through the hall. Then| I went into the bathroom in my room and the shower floor looked dirty/brown which grossed me out. Lastly| which is not a huge deal but still| their tv was tiny and outdated. I expected better for the price and from the Hilton brand.,1
Friendly staff| comfortable room. Hotel overall is a little dated but in good condition,1
We loved that they staff was really friendly and the fact that it was so conveniently by Disneyland just walking distance was amazing.,1
There wasn't much Available to view,0
Access to Disneyland Resort was great and reasonable.,1
Very nice hotel at a very good price. However| it is showing its age in several areas. Everything is clean but some things are pretty worn. Would still recommend this location if staying in the Disney/Convention Center area.,1
Proximity to Disneyland is a wonderful feature of this property.,1
We stayed here for our Disney trip and it was amazing. Very clean and comfortable. They also offer an affordable  shuttle to Disney. I have no complaints. There was even a Starbucks in the lobby very convenient.,1
I loved how close it was to Disneyland and that you could even purchase tickets to the park on site!! Saved us so much time.,1
I liked that is was easy access to Disneyland... the one major negative we experienced is finding a pair of  boxers on the floor next to courtyard window...grossed us out of course and made me believe that the room wasn't that clean after all.,0
Broken furniture and leaking shower head. Very disappointing.,0
I wish I knew parking was $21 a night| I only found out about that upon checking out. Other than that everything was great,1
I made a mistake on reservations and they would not accommodate me on any credit. They have the worse customer service. Dont try to contact the front desk ever because no one it there and dont try to call to talk to anyone!! Horrible service. I would not reccomend this hotel.,0
Liked the price. The person who checked me on was very nice and accommodating.,1
Happy happy no problems great great for Disney no hassles,1
Great place. Beautiful property. Nice amenities. Very helpful staff. Easy to get to Disneyland. We walked mostly. It's only a few blocks from it. Great places to eat all around the hotel as well as at the hotel itself.,1
Friendly staff at check-in! Great breakfast buffet! Jacuzzi that will re-align your spine!,1
Very nice Hilton| a little bit of a walk to Disneyland... but still close enough to walk,1
We had a large Executive King Suite.  The room was double the size of the avg room.  However| the bathroom was only half the size of the avg room!  The lobby and common areas are beautiful.,1
The hotel was very clean. Very up to date technically. Lots of shops and friendly staff.,1
Really enjoyed the stay,1
Nice staff members. Very helpful. Convenient location,1
Beds seem to sink in middle. I asked for room exchange and received it. However new room had bed mattress with dip as well. Overall good hotel.,1
Huge hotel| unfortunately the room was dated| rusted faucet and mirror in bathroom.,0
Check in was quick and helpful. We booked for Saturday night. We planned to go to. Disneyland for Saturday and Sunday. We were able to park before we checked in and also all day Sunday. It was about a 15-20 minute walk to the park. We didn't mind because we knew we were gonna be walking all day anyway. The rooms were very clean. Did not get to experience any amenities but saw there were a lot available to us and we wished we could stay just to hang out at the hotel! Will be booking here again!,1
The refrigerator was ok| it was rocky. The cabinet did not close.,1
Excellent property excellent service and cordial staff.,1
It was easy to access the Anaheim Convention Center and the Dining Room was great food plus the rooms were clean.,1
Quick trip with my kids to Disneyland. Great price-the hotel was okay...a little shabby in the hallways. Needs some updating. Room was okay-nothing special| but clean.,1
Rooms were not clean and need updating. Overpriced,0
I had the most pleasant stay even though it was incredibly busy the staff was still very accommodating,1
Property was well maintained. Carpets slightly old / worn. Very friendly staff| nice buffet breakfast. No complaints at all. Will stay again if in the area.,1
Great location. Plenty of food choices in the hotel or nearby. Room was in need of remodel/refresh. Stains on curtains and walls.,1
Our Air conditioner took 3 hours to cool our room| it was over 80 degrees...The maintenance guy looked at it and said it was working but the unit was too small for the corner room.,0
The room was really bad. The bed felt old and not comfortable at all. We can hear all the noice around the room. Don't like it at all.,0
Love the atmosphere. And also love that I can use my gold status for free breakfast at Starbucks!!!And Disney is very convenient-$7 Uber ride.,1
It seems elegant at first but once in the rooms they look weathered and starting to look old,1
Like almost any Hilton the property it self was great! We where traveling with a toddler and my next door neighbors decided to smoke pot lol!!!With that said I called front desk and stated that the odor was extreme and coming into my room with my toddler| they stated they would send security. We left and came back and the smell was worse| so I called again and they offered to come up and deodorize our room! First of all from the get go it would just have been so much better if they had just offered to move us instead of me asking to! I am not the type of person to be asking for anything just part of customer service i would have expected that| so due to the fact I had my child I had to ask! Or else honestly I would have not mind! Other than this event everything se was great. So hotel and amenities 5 star! But customer service cannot say the same!,1
The pool had a fun kids area| there were nice little touches like water with oranges available in the lobby.  I mile to Disney on a nice tree lined sidewalk.,1
I liked that it was still walking distance to Disneyland.,1
Hotel service was excellent| accommodations were nice. The only thing was the maid service was lacking bathroom sink was filthy. Later we left and no one ever came to clean up By overall a very nice place to stay we were able to watch some sports at the bar and all the staff were friendly and inviting,1
While the Lobby area and exterior of hotel are nice| the rooms need some serious updating. The bathroom was very aged and my bathtub had a few inches of water every time I took a shower. Everything in the room was also coated with dust.,0
The hotel room itself is only ok. The service was very professional. We got locked out of our hotel room due to a maintenance issue. Dan from security came right away was professional in all respects made sure we were comfortable and accommodated while they fixed things.,1
Very convenient to get to and from the event (NAMM 2020). Friendly staff| clean rooms| the noise level wasn't bad even though they had live music going on.,1
There should not be a charge for in-room internet. That's vanishing from most hotels.,1
The staff here is excellent| the halls on the floors were very cold. The mattresses were  worn| but still comfortable. You could definitely tell which side people use frequently. It was very clean and quiet. The location cannot be beat. It was easy to walk to a variety of places. The breakfast buffet was awesome and the lunch and dinner was good also.,1
Everything is good. People are friendly. The room is clean,1
It was good fairly convenient to Disneyland.  Bus stop very close and ticket dispenser very accessible,1
My family and I stayed one night fro our daughters club volleyball tournament a few blocks away. The hotel was great and the service was excellent. We will definitely be staying there a few more times this year complementary buffet breakfast was delicious and perfect before our game.,1
The property was somewhat aged. Very pricey ! The staff did a great job with directions and answering questions.,1
I booked this hotel specifically to be able to take my 4 and 8 year old to the indoor pool. When we checked in I was told the indoor pool access was only available for people ages 16 and above. They would not refund my money at first. I told them I was willing to pay for a day| if they would reimburse me for the second day so I could relocate to a different hotel. It was nice| but I really booked it for the pool so I couldn't justify the higher cost. Finally| I guess they preferred to lose all my money because they said they would refund all my costs but I would have to relocate right then. No problem| I called Expedia and they were able to solve my issue| relocate my children and I. I only lost three hours on top of late check in time of 4 pm. It was a great hassle| but lesson learned! Never booking with Hilton again.,0
The hotel was in short walking distance to Disneyland. The staff were very friendly and polite. The hotel lobby was beautiful. My room was spacious| clean and comfortable. I will surely return to Hilton Anaheim in the near future.,1
The room was big and clean.,1
We thought the property was outdated| interior was dark and dreary. A friends vehicle was broken into in the parking garage which has no cameras or security patrol. Although the city of Anaheim operates the garage| Hilton patrons park there. The only advantage we found was the hotel's proximity to Disneyland and the convention center where we were attending an event.,0
Room sold to us with ‚Äúpool views‚Äù. There was not a pool view in sight. Only satellite dishes and roofs. Complained to management twice and eventually got one days free parking as compensation. üò≥,0
Overall it was a brilliant place to stay| with a convenient bus to Disneyland;  Only issue was that the wait time at the internal Starbucks was crazy long....,1
Property was clean| staff was friendly| and bed was comfortable.,1
It's a nice location and away just a little bit from Disneyland| but I was unhappy with the hallways and room; they are very outdated and dusty. The staff mentioned that the property will see a remodel soon! There were two large spiders that came out of the headboard as I was sleeping in the middle of the night. For the two nights I was there| the toilet never flushed properly. They removed the toilet| brought it back| came back again and again to fix it| but it never worked. The shower wasn't draining properly. Overall| the two days were annoying and inconvenient. However| the lobby| overall look and feel of the hotel are very nice| and the staff are accommodating and pleasant to deal with.,0
Extremely coherent process to obtain anything I needed,1
When we arrived we were greeted by valet and the check in process was easy. The hotel is big so we did get lost many times going in and out of our room. The room was clean and simple. We stayed at this hotel during our visit to Disneyland. While the walk isn't bad| I appreciated that the Disney parking lot With complimentary shuttles to the park was just a walk across the street. I would Stay here again,1
Close to Disneyland. Very nice hotel. Was glad to stay there. Would go back.,1
The food court needs better options.  There is only 1 Starbucks for hundreds if not thousands of guests.  The line in the morning was ridiculous.  The basketball court is dark and dingy.,1
Great location| nice bar| great amenities and friendly staff,1
Loved the location and the views from the room. I also liked the convenient location and accessibility of the parking building (self-parking).,1
Best place I've ever been too it was perfect and will stay again,1
It was freezing cold in that whole hotel. We will never stay there again. We will go to the Marriott from now on. The bar staff were less than desirable. Tried to sell us high end products because they did not have High West. House wine was horrible.,0
Horrible. So dirty. Disgusting. Never stay in that hotel again.,0
carpet was threadbare with spots| made me uneasy| did not enjoy having to pay additional for parking..,1
At check in on Christmas Eve| we requested to be on level 12 with family but the initial front desk receptionist said ‚Äúthey were 100% booked‚Äù. So we were given a room on level 5| perfectly fine. The hallway had a light odor| and upon entering the room it also smelled like wet carpet. Approx 1/4 of the floor was soaked. Luckily we were given an alternative room on level 10 by a different receptionist| as well as a $50 credit for the inconvenience (so| it must be in their script to say the hotel is 100% booked) Aside from the squeaky pipes and plumbing in room #2| it did the job. We were sad to find out that in order to use the amenities| gym and basketball court it would cost an additional $20/day. The Starbucks located in the hotel was appreciated. We asked to extend our stay one more night| but again| ‚Äúthe hotel is 100% booked‚Äù so we ended staying our final night at a competitor nearby. The hotel is modern| clean and majority of the staff is friendly and accommodating.,1
I like that the location to Disney is great| just a 20 minute walk and the price is good too. But there were several issues all starting with room key. We called guest services who sent security who never came. We went downstairs and even though the woman said it was probably the door battery| she gave us knew keys and said try that first which of course didn't work. We finally got in touch with someone who sent someone up to change the battery and finally after 40 minutes of back and forth we were in our room. Room was ok but there was someone's hair all over the bathtub and walls and the heater didn't work. After leaving for the day and coming back| the room key did not work in the elevator so we had to go get it re-keyed. Day after| coming back again late door key did not work AGAIN| so we had to get it re-keyed. The front desk said ‚Äúyou're from Reno| you know how it goes.‚Äù Although he was very pleasant| no| I don't know how it goes.,0
Very clean| smelled great when you entered. Had lots of things to do within the hotel and the staff was incredibly friendly,1
We have a family of four and have stayed at this hotel a few times and have always had a great experience. We have stayed here for both Disneyland trips and while using the convention center. The lobby is beautiful and the staff is very courteous. It is a little bit of a walk to Disneyland from here| so for younger kids I would reccomend the shuttle| but older children and teenagers should be able to handle the walk just fine. The rooms are moderately quiet| but if people are talking in the hallways they can be heard pretty well. The price varies greatly so sometimes you can stay here for much cheaper than other hotels in the area but othertimes it onw of the more expensive ones. Overall a great experience.,1
Air circulation had dust particles. Fresh Towels frequently had yellow stains. Shower curtains were not closing (Keeps coming off to middle). Locker was not working. Whooping parking charge. It was ok last year despite some uncomfortableness. This year went beyond my tolerance level. Not coming again to this hotel.,0
Everything was great no complains from.the lobby to the foom and the restaurant,1
"The stay was ok. The pictures online and the actual hotel ""outside"" of the rooms were amazing. Very nice and beautifully decorated. The rooms however were very small| and my room smelled like cigarette smoke which is odd| but all in all| the stay was just fine.",1
An excellent location for Disney parks and much more affordable than staying on the property. The staff is very friendly and truly wants to make your stay enjoyable. The entire property was very clean as well.,1
Good place to stay with your boyfriend/girlfriend/family,1
Close to Disneyland and lots of restaurants available in the area. Also has a good court downstairs with reasonable prices,1
Front desk staff was very helpful. Room was clean and updated.,1
Great service| amenities and very comfortable.,1
Outside look was very impressive Lobby area very modern,1
We had a wonderful time at the Hilton! Can't wait for our next visit!,1
We had a great stay in Anaheim and the Hilton was a fantastic place to rest from 3 days at Disneyland| we enjoyed the rooms| staff was outstanding and the food was superb.,1
Staff was veery friendly and accommodating. We were coming home from Disneyland and just by calling| they allowed us to go pass the midnight last check in time. They also greeted me happy birthday throughout my stay| which made my day.,1
Hotel is close to Disneyland. Kids stay for free. Rooms are clean and the beds are comfy.,1
Great stay! The hotel itself is fancy and high class. I loved that it is walking distance from Disneyland. The only thing that bothered me was the extra fees like WiFi| pool access| parking| and even to have a microwave in your room! I'm already paying a lot for staying there| so I just think these little things should be included in your stay.,1
The food court|  like very much| A lot to chose from.,1
I've stayed at this hotel a handful of times and it's always in great conditions however this time my bathroom mirror was broken and my faucet was leaking water also the shower was clogged.not Sure why it was in a bad condition.,1
The lobby smells like Christmas! They pump a nice lovely cinnamon scent and had tons of Christmas trees out for silent auction along with a Christmas movie playing for the kids in a special area. Great decor and an at-home feel with friendly staff. The breakfast was pricey and had a pretty good selection I just wasn't a fan of the price of it. Overall| an excellent stay. Also would have loved not to pay for parking too,1
Staff was courteous and friendly. Room was clean and comfortable.,1
Nice clean room| decor in the lobby was very nice for Christmas. All staff we encountered were wonderful.,1
Nowhere on the website did it mention an extra charge for the gym at the hotel| this was one of the reasons we chose this hotel in particular. We got there to find out that we had to pay 16 dollars per person per session! The hotel in general was dated and worn and in much need of a renovation. It seemed overall that everything we came across was an extra charge| including breakfast.,0
Some what dated| not great food options. Staff was good and room was adequate.,1
While the hotel was clean and the lobby was great| the room walls were paper thin. I could hear the toilets flushing 3 rooms down. They charge extra for EVERYTHING! I mean $15 a day to use the gym? $15 each for breakfast?!? These are things that should be included at the prices they charge. And the staff| while friendly| seemed more like friendly but at the same time trying to get rid of you. Oh. And they charged $50 a day for incidentals to my card. I'm still waiting for my refund. Amazing how the money was taken from my account immediately but takes forever to return it. I seriously doubt I'll ever stay at a Hilton again.,0
While I wouldn't say it was amazing| it did its job. The room was sufficiently spacious and clean. The water temperature was a little hard to finagle.,1
The air conditioning was loud. It sounded like water running the whole night.,1
We have stayed here before and had no complaints. We like the location and the lobby is very nice| But this trip was different.we were in a very small room. Furniture was used and abused. Exhaust fan in the bathroom didn't work.The toilet seat cover looked like a kid used it as a coloring book and someone tried very poorly to get it off.Wall with the window on it was very noisy. Every time someone above us would walk| we would hear the window creaking very loudly. We've stayed here in the past. But with the newer hotels in the area. We will be giving them a chance over the Hilton Anaheim again.,0
Good| central location to Disneyland. Definitely recommend taking the ART shuttle ($6/day or multi-day passes available). Guest Services staff were awesome!,1
The hotel is nice but it's a shame that they charge to use the gym,1
The room was fair. The privacy between rooms was terrible. The guests in the room were up most of the night and we could hear EVERY WORD and SOUND they made down to the passing of gas in the restroom. It sounded as if they were on our porch with the door open . The walls were so thin that we did not sleep until they did... even then we were so tired and frustrated it was still impossible.  The room service did however go out of their way and made us the most amazing Banana splits( not on the menu) that it ALMOST made up for the lack of sleep. The homemade whipped cream was ‚Äúto die for!! Also the floor in our room was  extremely slanted for what we can assume the the building had settled. Our family members didn't have the same experience on 2 floors up.  Also sometime during the night there was a flood and the hallway flooded. The holiday decorations in the lobby were beautiful! We give the hotel a C- and we will not be staying at this hotel again and won't recommend it to our friends or family.,0
Nice. Starbucks in hotel. Friendly staff. Clean. Parking is expensive,1
"Gorgeous grounds. Super convenient to everything i wanted tp go to. But room was motel 6 dated| stains on wall| paper thin walls| no fan in bathroom (?)| and the ""lanai"" was in truth| just a rooftop helipad that the check in girl talmed me into| that i paid extra for ugh. Oh| and stains down the side of the cabinet. The staff was either fantastic or openly hostile - take your pick. I had one staff member actually roll eyes at me for asking for scissors at the help desk. Im a nice guy and im thinking its not me| its her.  Its whatever| i was right next to the convention center| but next year ill walk a little further. The Hilton did not impress? I repeatedly thought ""This hotel is hundreds a night| and its soooo basic."" Not minimal| basic.",0
I didn't like the old/torn furniture in the lobby.,1
The rooms were ok but the bathroom was a bit to be desired. It looks old and in dire need of updating. Some mold in shower. The sink area was not up to par for a 4 star hotel. Especially under sink. The big black piece of wood looks terrible. The paint on it was peeling and also in the mirror.,0
The staff provided excellent service| especially when checking in. Only thing is expect to share the hotel with many business people and convention attendees.,1
Lobby was beautiful| clean rooms. Didn't like the price to park and the $28 breakfast buffet was a bit much. Not really worth the price.  I think the breakfast menu should be a little more everyday type food. Like eggs and bacon| ham and cheese omelette etc. a little to fancy for regular people.  Also when ckg. Out there was a charge we didn't make it was corrected,1
It was alive and spacious with a variety of shops| stores| plenty of tables and chairs all over that you could eat or work at| and a great mix of  eateries and restaurants; overall| a dynamic space with a colorful atmosphere| integrating lounging areas and more formal sections to  ensure the celebration of  life.,1
The stay was very nice & thank you for resolving our room situation for us. Definitely will be returning back.,1
The staff were nice but the hotel was old| a bit run down and smelly.  Our room had 2 beds and they were both bad/really saggy and need replacing.  The bathroom sink could only be used with the water on a trickle or it would back up right away... the nice gal at the front desk apologized and said they'd address the issue.  All and all I'd stay somewhere else next time.,0
Great room and comfy bed. Room had lots of towels. Loved the Xmas decor in the lobby.,1
The second room that that brought us to had not been cleaned and there were dirty towels on the furniture.,0
The property was clean staff was friendly but there was not a microwave inside the room.,1
Big Hilton| very busy| but nice. I would come here again.,1
Always a great place to stay. Best hot tub in the area,1
The maid entered my room without warning as I was getting out of the shower.  Very embarrassing situation| and certainly unprofessional.  Also our room was very dirty!  Everything cost extra| even the fitness center!  I will never stay at this property again!  Very unhappy!,0
Cleanliness| great indoor bar| especially enjoyed the having a Starbucks inside the hotel and also the close proximity to Disneyland.,1
Our bathtub was dirty and we asked for it to be cleaned everyday and it wasn't. The toilet seat was so scratched up it looked like it should be in a dumpster.,0
Overall great hotel. I was not pleased however at the fact that the HAVC fan kept turning off in our room all night. Seems as though it is motion controlled so I kept having to wave my arm in the air all night to get the fan to turn on. This will probably prevent me from returning.,1
Heating system did not work properly| room floor is slanted| especially in the bathroom| everything is old and needs to be updated| parking is terrible| system went down and it took too long to check in.,0
Close to theme park  and walking distance to Disneyland,1
Understaffed front desk took very long to check in and very long to get our car,1
"Good location| easy to hop on the bus to and fro Disney. ""Mix"" restaurant overpriced and not great. Pool area needs refreshing| hot tubs dirty.",1
Great hotel to stay at if you're going to Disneyland or if you are attending a convention at the Anaheim convention center! Walking distance to everything you'd need for a Disney trip!,1
We were in town for BlizzCon-we loved how it was so close to the convention center and walking distance from the CVS as well as a gas station and some other places to eat. Everything was clean| all the staff was friendly-everyone greeted us with a smile and hello when we walked by. It is a bit big| so we got turned around a couple times| but the staff was extremely helpful in helping us navigate around. The StarBucks inside‚Äîthey handle a long line/morning rush like champs too‚Äîline might be long| but they get you through it quick!,1
Staff was excellent. Never had an issue with that.,1
HOTEL WAS GREAT 28.00 TO PARK THE CAR PER DAY DOES NOT APPEAL TO ME. AND THEY SERVED NO COMPLIMENTRY BREAKFAST,1
It was super close to blizzcon and I loved the location,1
I always feel the staff does a great job .. the rooms are clean,1
The hotel customer service is top notch and the hotel offers many wonderful amenities. The room was a lot smaller than I anticipated| however I own that one since I was basically looking for just the best rate I could get and failed to really research what size each room was. Overall| I would definitely stay here again when the opportunity arises.,1
The property is clean| the staff is friendly| and we had everything we needed.,1
Indoor pool is adult only i didnt see this when looking it up and the lobby being shared with the bar made it smell like cheap perfume,1
The Hotel was nice | it had everything I needed. I thought the staff were Very Very Nice and helpful üëç,1
The hotel is nice and clean. Easy walk to Disneyland. Beds were comfortable. Staff were all very nice. We did not try the restaurant. But room service food was decent. The only thing is the rooms are nothing great for being a Hilton and paying the extra price. Other hotel in the area are cheaper and just as nice of a room. Wish it had a microwave in the room.,1
The customer service and amenities were nice. There's a food court & Starbucks which were awesome. What I was disappointed about was the condition of room. The bed was comfortable but overall room needed an upgrade/remodel. The pictures online were a lot nicer than the actual room. I probably won't stay here again until the rooms are nicer.,1
Room was nice| great price| view of the courtyard. Clean| no noisy neighbors| all I can really complain about it the green LED that's always on in the fire alarm (I like pitch black sleeping). Close walk to everything. Pleased overall.,1
Air Conditioner was busted constantly on an extremely hot week. Hot water in the shower didn't work consistently| we had to get in the habit of waking up early to start running the water to get it hot (ice cold every morning) wifi was free but not really? Half of our party was given a free wifi for the week the other half was told to pay| the wifi also cuts out every time you swap between the lobby and your room. Pool and Hot Tub was great and location to the park was nice. The ART bus for Disney is a waste of money| just Uber/Lyft to the parks| cheaper| more reliable,0
Very convenient to convention center as well as to Disneyland. Modern and clean| we enjoyed our stay. A nice touch was the hotel brought cake and a card up to our room for my sons birthday.,1
Very nice hotel| room was very spacious| although not clean| found socks from the previous guests under the table.,1
We had booked a king size bed room and we got charged for a king but the room we got had a queen size bed.,0
Clean| safe| upscale property with easy access to Disneyland shuttle. Onsite amenities such as the store| food court and Disneyland kiosk were great,1
For a Hilton| you'd expect more. Overall nice hotel| very clean| service is great| but the rooms seemed a bit crammed. -The bathroom was super tiny and when the door opened (inward) it was about an inch away from hitting the toilet. -The closet was pretty small and when that door opened it always slammed on the wall.-My biggest disappointment was that the mini fridge didn't have a freezer section as most other hotels we've stayed at. We drove 8 hours with a 2 year old so we had to pack freezer packs in an ice chest to keep his milk cold. So| by the time we had to drive back home| we had to stop for ice at a gas station because our packs were melted.-EVERYTHING has a charge- the breakfast ($70) for my husband| toddler| and myself. Shuttle to Disneyland parks had a charge (1-day passes or 3-day $16 I believe)| using the gym was $30 for one day.I joked with my husband that even a fart would cost you some $$Last year we stayed at the Marriott SpringHill Suites and to be honest the rooms were much more spacious| breakfast was amazing| freezer in the mini fridge| and just a short walk to the park!,1
Hotel was old and grungy. Furniture was old and upholstery was torn.  Lobby was loud.We stayed one night and left the next day.,0
We loved our experience| the valet was really nice to have and front desk was friendly| the room was really clean and stocked.,1
Its affordable walking distance to Disneyland and most importantly really clean and comfortable,1
ordered a dessert with extra ice cream to take upstairs.  It didn't have the extra ice cream| when brought to there attention| they gave me the extra ice cream and removed the charge from my bill.,1
The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The location is great and easy access to Disney,1
Ordinary hotel that is way| way overpriced . There was 3 of us staying there and we went the buffet breakfast and the bill came to $93.93 then with the tip it was $100.00. For basically bacon and eggs.,0
Super accommodating staff| all very pleasant.  Text to concierge was very convenient.,1
We love this property because it has great food and location. But this time our room was dusty and the carpet was sticky in spots. The carpet was disgusting looking. We may not be back,1
I absolutely loved the way the hotel smelled in the lobby. It was fresh and clean. The aroma or fragrance wasn't strong but rather very soothing. I could sit in the lobby all day. Usually| in past stays the hotel lobby reeked of smoke or sweat. This place did not. Very good job there!,1
Great front desk service at check-in especially considering at late night (past midnight) arrival.  Wish they had late night dining menu and breakfast door hanger.  Easy walk to Disneyland.,1
Great location near Disney| and clean comfortable rooms.,1
The rooms were outdated and we were on the Executive level! (No USB for phones for example) The bathroom was super small| with peeling paint on the mirror and the sliding door of the bathroom was very difficult to close. Also there was no bathroom fan.  The outdoor swimming pool was small and lacklustre.,0
very shady about your 21.00 a day for parking you don't find out until you are their and its to late humm it was in the fine print right. 42.00 to park at your on hotel that's bull wont be back thx.,0
we love the pool and kids pool area| the fact that is near disneyland.  However didnt' like the parking lot situation and parking attendants not communicating correctly,1
The staff was nice and that where the good stuff ends.  The room was mediocre| the furniture was old and scuffed.  The mini fridge was missing a leg so it rocked.  The bed was awful.  The food was awful and terribly overpriced.   The furniture in the lobby was old and the top layer was peeling off the vinyl.  Ughh a Motel 6 would've been a better choice and about half the price.  I will never stay here again and warn anyone that asks to stay away from Hilton Hotels.,0
This place is in serious need of an up-grade.  We paid extra for the lanai deck which was a waste.  This place has so many possibilities.  Our room was dirty| the chair and the desk chair both had stains.  Not the kind of place we wanted to hang out at.  We spent most of our time at Disney just so we did not have to be at the hotel.,0
This was within a good walking distance to Disney. The room was your standard hotel room with tan walls and the hospital style doors. Rug had some stains. Would consider it a fine hotel room| but did not feel like a vacation kinda place. More of a room to stay in passing through.,1
Large and busy hotel. Very convenient to Disney. Good bar and food options. Nice pool. Spacious rooms. We were upgraded to a room with a deck on late check in (no king beds left). Very good experience.,1
Early check in was not allowed without an up charge and then we were sent to a room that did not match the description given at check in. Late check out is only accommodated if you call the morning you are leaving.,0
Across the street from Disneyland shuttle and short walk to stores and restaurants.The thin walls leave something to be desired| could hear everyone really early in the morning| but not too big of a deal.,1
Beds and pillows rooms were all great great location only thing paying so much for parkin??,1
We had to extend our trip and was unable to stay at a Disney Resort due to being full. We came to the Anaheim Hilton and loved it there. We won't be going back to Disney Resorts when your beautiful| clean and spacious hotel is a much better price!,1
$5.00 for water and $21 a day for parking says it all....,0
It has a nice lounge in the front entrance. Service is ok. However| you will get nickled and dimed| (example: low grade wifi was $14 high speed $19 on top of hotel stay price) . Room was plane jane| nothing special other than you have a sliding door for the bathroom with no lock.,1
I liked the location and the amenities. The staff was great and the rooms were good,1
Clean and great location. Nothing else to say but need 50 characters.,1
The facility is clean and lovely. The employees were all friendly and helpful. The rooms were immaculate and the price is very reasonable. No more Disney Resorts for us!,1
Very nice. Lives up to Hilton brand. Pleasant stay with complete amenities.,1
Enjoyed a quick trip to Anaheim for a weekend getaway and enjoyed this property. This is a very busy hotel with a lot of activity going on around it| the staff keeps things moving smoothly and we never felt crowded in such a busy hotel. We will stay here again.,1
I liked everything about the hotel. Just the staff at the front desk could of been more considerate  and understanding.,1
The staff was incredibly nice and thoughtful.  It was one of the best experiences I've had at a hotel.,1
Very clean and excellent service also beds are very comfortable would definitely come back,1
It's clear that they have put a lot of money into maintaining the restaurant| bar| pool| and those types of amenities however the room was outdated and in disrepair. There was mystery dried red goo on the walls| dirty marks on the ceiling| the beds were lumpy and uncomfortable| the shower was extremely difficult to moderate the temperature| the control to switch from shower to bath was difficult to use| the bath plug leaked| and so on. It was really disappointing that a hotel charging a minimum of $250 a night for the cheapest room wouldn't at least offer a continental breakfast when similar hotel chains at similar price points to| and that parking was so expensive. Aside from that| they didn't have the king size room we reserved and instead gave us a room with two queen size beds| which was frustrating. The only positive thing about our stay was the proximity to Disneyland. I would never stay at this hotel again| and I'm honestly not at all difficult to please when it comes to these things. I have never left a negative review on a hotel before but this experience was truly disappointing| especially given how expensive the stay was.,0
We had a great stay! Took the kids to Disneyland. We brought our truck that's lifted and we were able to keep it safe in valet parking.  Hotel was always busy because of the convention center. | but check in/out was a breeze. It's very close to Disneyland but we still took the bus which we never seemed to wait more than 5 min for. Totally recommend getting bus pass if your going to DL. It was nice to take breaks from the park and enjoy the nice pool area at the hotel. We had a room on the 5th floor that opened up to the pool deck. It was perfect. Only complaint I have is that I ordered Chips and salsa by the pool. Paid $25 and it wasn't busy but somehow they forgot about me. I lost track of time 35 minutes later I walked up to the bar and they apologized that that forgot about me. I'm not sure how because it was not busy. Oh well. Lessons learned. Overall we were very pleased Also the gift shops had Way cheaper prices for DL items. Pic was from our room view.,1
IT WAS NICE AND BIG VERY FRIENDLY STAFF I WILL BE BACK ... THERE WAS A VERY STRONG ODER OF PRESUME THROUGH OUT THE STAY THAT MADE ME GET A HEAD ACHE,1
All good but get a better shower. Close to items and food,1
Perfect two night stay. A lot of amenities! Easy to get to Disneyland with a Lyft ride. I highly recommend Hilton Anaheim!,1
The kids loved the kids slides by the pool| The breakfast buffet was really good really enjoyed it. big hotel has everything you need.,1
Friendly staff and beautiful property. The property was kept clean and we enjoyed our visit.,1
What a beautiful hotel!!! We were very impressed with the room. It was very spacious and the bed was oh so comfortable. The location is pretty close to Disneyland| although I wouldn't mind a complimentary shuttle for the price you pay to stay there. We took the ART bus which would pick up and drop off fairly frequently.,1
Very nice clean place close to conference .,1
Love the outdoor water play area for kids. Us big kids like it too.,1
Nice rooms with easy access to Disneyland via shuttle,1
Staff was very friendly but the restaurant is expensive,1
It was nice a big| room however were a little dated. Could use some renos. Very humid in the room even with the A/C on.,1
Slight issue while trying to check in. Desk staff was super helpful and more than made up for the slight delay. Extra clean facility. Breakfast buffet was more than decent.,1
I expected more with the  hilton name|  the bathroom had hair|  and the bathroom knobs falling off.  Your a guest and paying for your room and you dint get free wifi|  and you pay for parking|  this should all come with the room. On the good side the people were nice|  but i would never go back to this hilton,0
When we arrived we immediately noticed that one of the water bottles provided (at additional charge) was already opened.. trash cans had no bags| no laundry bag provided| Hilton Honors WiFi was so hard to connect to| the toilet seat was broken| parking is cheaper for non guests than it is for actual guests| windows were dirty| the room itself just looked so off and the coffee maker looked like it was recently used- it was still wet in the water compartment. The stay was way less than what I expected for a Hilton and once everything was mentioned to the front desk| all we were offered was a water? Not okay.. will not stay here ever again,0
House keeping went into our room at 8:01am on our last day| super rude that she walked in has I was getting out of shower.  I won't coming back again,0
Loved the comfortable beds and the great front desk staff. Everyone was really nice!,1
We have issues when we try to check it take us almost an hour| because Hilton Anaheim told us our registration it was process| so we have to call expedia custumer service and they said transaction was complete on their end| so we ask to speak to a Manager(Lori) at Hilton and she said check ins sometimes takes longer than an hour| she was very rude and seem she didn't care about the situatuation. The rest of the staff it was very nice and cordial. This is the first time we have so many issues to check in .,0
Accessible to Disneyland| However the room could have use more seating area,1
Pros:Very friendly staff| I love that there is shopping and Starbucks inside the building. Also was very clean.Cons: I felt like parking fees were excessive and the rooms are a bit outdated. The elevator took forever and was always full,1
I love how close it was to Disneyland. Walking distance. Everything was clean in the hotel room. I like how there was a food court inside the hotel aside from the bar and restaurant. The staff that checked us in was very helpful.,1
The hotel is conventiently located 3 long blocks from Disneyland. The Anahiem Convention Ctr is right next door. There is a simple food court if you dont want to pay alot on room service / food. There is also a Starbucks coffee on the 1st floor. But it closes very early. I assume the hotel food service is what they want guests to pay for instead. I get it. The room was nice. Desk is hooked up with a laptop / charging / internet jacks. TV was basic and will charge you to watch premium movies. HBO was free. Bed was terribly soft and muddy. As well as the pillows. But I may be used to a more firm bed. Lots of extra towels. Be careful when taking your first shower as there are 2 towels inside the shower? And for environmentally friendly types| there was a small sign stating if you dont want your towels washed every day| simply hang them up dry and the housekeeping staff will not spend the resources to was / dry / stock them until you place them on the floor. Overall| this was a fine visit. The Expedia service was almost effortless. Now to pay the bills...,1
What can I say....it's a Hilton. Spacious lobby| good sized room| comfortable bed| and great location. The rate I got was amazing. The service was friendly and helpful. If you plan on going to Disneyland| as I was| this is a very nice place to stay at. Not far from the park| and you have a very secure| safe and family feel to it. The shuttle to Disneyland is a bus that makes a few stops on the way| but it is not that expensive and still only takes about 10 minutes to get there. However| the buses that return from Disneyland to the Hilton stop running just before the park closes. Be mindful of this. Another big drawback is that there is no hotel shuttle to the Orange County(John Wayne) airport . Nevertheless| it is a splendid hotel. I had a great stay here and would definitely return again.,1
Great place to stay. Our go to hotel near Disneylan!,1
Staying here is sufficient for a Hilton experience. I expected a bit more from the on-property gym but that is probably because I regularly go to a very nice gym. The rooms are OK in size but expect to be able to hear your neighbors - I could hear plates| a fussy baby| etc. and this concerned me that perhaps our TV or alone time could be heard. I prefer the location about a mile away - suites for the price of a small room here. However| there is much to be able to walk to from this location.,1
Upon arrival our air conditioning was not turned on so our room was very hot considering it was in the 90's outside. We turned it on and left for about 5 hours. Still hot in the room. No windows or balcony to air it out. Had to have someone repair the air conditioner. After that the air was fine. The pictures and reviews looked a lot nicer than this hotel actually is. It looks good when you walk in but the hotel is older and not in a good way. The floor looks like it's sinking when you walk through the halls like the building has settled. The room was outdated along with the bathroom. Felt more like a 2 or maybe 3 star. Our bedding was very old and used which grossed me out. It looked like an old towel that's been used for 10  years that needs to be thrown away. It also smelt like a pool. It had two sheets to cover and dress it up so overall very thin bedding. I will say our room had a beautiful view of the city| sunrise| and sunset. The pool was fun| could just use a few more umbrellas for busy days. Service at the hotel was great. Checking in and out was a breeze. No additional surprise charges. I really enjoyed the Starbucks inside the lobby.,0
I had a wonderful time at the Hilton! Very respectful and felt welcomed.,1
Lets just say some hotels like to leave chocolate after they clean the room| this hotel decided to leave me the trash and cleaning supplies in the room .,0
Great location| awesome amenities at the hotel| staff was friendly| rooms were clean- overall a great stay! Hi,1
Great stay! I wish Starbucks would stay open past 6pm and that by time of check out they still had breakfast. They ran out :( other than that the hotel is great! They waived our early check in fee by giving us a double room as oppose to king bed.,1
Beautiful hotel| easy walk to Disney| clean| friendly and very helpful staff.,1
Not good they would not work with me when my special event cancelled,0
So glad we went choose the Hilton for a recent Disneyland trip. We drove past this gorgeous hotel during the 4th of July trip. I'd prefer stay here again rather than the Hyatt. 1.Clean / spacious rooms with fridge 2.Great service 3. Food court with great choices (Baja Fresh is an old favorite that's no longer near me.)4. Two gift shops | the one on the same side of Starbucks rocks. 5. Order room service breakfast|  Mickey waffles  were yummy!6. Excellent vallet service Would definitely recommend and can't wait to stay again .. thank you Hilton Anaheim.,1
My granddaughter had a great time. She loved the pool,1
The options in the hotel as far as pool| food| little store. Location to Disneyland. Kid friendly.,1
Excellent location and property. We really enjoyed being so close to the Disney parks and surrounder by so many food options.,1
Room is pretty clean.  Bedding quite comfortable. Just missing one set of towel on the first night. 3 sets of towel for 4 people. Have to join hilton loyalty program to get free wifi. A bite of trouble. Starbuck on premise quite handy . A bit far to walk to  Disneyland.  But okay if your  kids are not too small. Used art bus to get around after walking for 3 days.,1
Loved the room was on the pool level and we could step out the slider and walk right out to the pool.,1
Everything went fine. Room had a strange red stain on the floor but I let it be. Check in and check out went well| though they tried to charge parking even though I never used it. I asked them not to charge me starting first day and someone at that front desk told me they removed it but at check out time| it was still being charged. They removed it then. However| had I chosen an express check out| I would've been charged. Pool area and bar staff were my favorite. Super friendly and great to talk to. Room and view were great.,1
Overall the hotel is clean and safe. The staff are friendly and answered all of our questions. The location to Disney (which is why we were there) is about a 20min walk if you want to do that. It's fine in the morning but a bit of a journey at the end of a long day if you don't take the shuttle or an Uber. It does show the wear and tear of high turnover at times. Although the maintenance team is actively trying to stay on top of it.,1
No complaints at all.  Everything was perfect| room was very clean and comfortable.,1
We checked in early and the staff at the front desk was super informative and helpful. During our stay the D23 expo was happening right next door but the hotel did a great job of not letting it get loud at our expense. We Ubered to Disney every day but the toy story lot was right up the block where you can catch a bus to the parks.,1
To of the line convention center hotel. Center is on site. Disneyland a bit of a walk.,1
My flight was canceled| and called the frond desk. They initially agreed to refund and finally just lied.,0
Liked the location but the room seemed to be a little old.,1
Very nice and clean hotel but the pillows and beds are too soft.,1
Very nice hotel| the person who checked us in gave us the wrong rooms (2 double beds) I had reserved. I called from the room and who ever answered the phone took care of the problem and sent a bellman with keys to our new rooms. The new rooms had king size beds which is what I booked.,1
Clean and comfortable! Staff made our stay at the Hilton enjoyable!,1
Beds seemed old and lumpy. Everything else was good.,1
It was a good experience. Would definitely book again.,1
"You can tell the hotel is a little older.  But it is well maintained.  Staff are great| restaurant and bar are very well run.  Good food.  Within walking distance to Disney parks but shuttles available.  My only ""dislike"" was that the pool is small for such a big hotel.",1
The hotel was great overall! Our room was very clean and comfortable when we arrived. We had dinner at MIX our first night. The veal/pasta entree was okay at best. We also ordered the pepperoni pizza which was much better. We took the rest of the pizza back to the room because we thankfully had a mini fridge. We had dinner at Disneyland all other days. Speaking of ‚Äî we walked to Disneyland both days we went and the distance wasn't bad to walk.On our last day| we went to the pool. The pools open early and check-in is at noon| so we were able to use the pools before leaving with plenty time to spare. The outdoor pool is free to use| but there's a charge for the indoor pool.When we checked out| we went downstairs and the line was long so we opted for the express check-out via text which was much easier. We left our bags at the luggage storage because we had a later flight. It was only $1/person. we got our bags back really quickly.Overall| we had a great stay. we didn't utilize the amenities too much but we still enjoyed our time.,1
Property is too commercial and meant for conventions.,1
Room was a handicap room the door to bathroom was broke,1
We came for a trip to disney! Everything went great with our stay! We did try to buy tickets at your Disney desk but there was an issue & we were unable to!,1
Great stay| clean| comfy| and very spacious room,1
Great experience and very close to disney,1
I liked everything..the most awesome part was that the air conditioning was on and the room was very nice and cool for this hot summer,1
Hotel lobby and staff were nice. The rooms were outdated. The carpet was outdated and the TV/entertainment was outdated. Did not like these amenities.,1
Unfriendly staff| broken elevators| and all amenities require a fee.,0
The property is very dated and needs remodeling. The rooms are not very clean| especially bathrooms.,0
Great price| quiet and comfortable bed!  Checking in was lightning fast.,1
Rooms were ok| not that great. That not very impressive!,1
The pool needs to be bigger for the size of the hotel. We will stay again for sure,1
The staff is fantastic| the rooms are clean| and it's near Disneyland.,1
never got any breakfast perks..but our room view was perfect for the fireworks show at disneyland!,1
It was pretty good.,1
Great place to stay at in Anaheim| close walk to Disneyland. Great staff| go to place when staying in Anaheim.,1
The property was clean and beautiful. Room was spacious.,1
Room not clean| we had some insects and spiders in the room,0
Great stay| very convenient| close to restaurant| Disneyland| downtown Disney. I would definitely stay her again. The staff was very nice and willing to help with any questions that I had.,1
When we got there the room was clean but had what looked like black streaks all over the pillow. When we got our room cleaned it was the same like they never changed the pillows. I called up for two blankets and four tooth brushes which took two calls and almost 50 min. There was what looked like mold in between the bed frame and wall,0
I was thrilled when I realized the hotel had a food court. I was hungry & exhausted from walking around Disneyland all day.,1
Close proximity to Disneyland. Incredibly clean and quiet.,1
Came out for our HS 30th reunion. Stayed in Aneheim instead of Torrance. Due to the proximity to airport and things to do.,1
Hotels.com changed us for breakfast and did not have the hotel give it to us,0
I was really happy that they put us on the top floor. It seemed as though the other floors were incredibly noisy. Our door was a little off the henge. Bathroom was cleaned; however| the air vents were dirty.,1
Nothing to like. Every thing is old and the service you get depends on how much you tipped a day before. The place is old| the people are old and so is the service. This place is desperately asking for face lift and to be a 21st century ready,0
We had to wait 30 minutes in line to check in. Even at 11:30 pm the line was long with only 4 people working at registration.,1
I was very disappointed with the room - we stayed two days. the room door faced the pool and there was a corridor where people went back and forth| running| etc. and making so much noise. There was even a knock on our door... I had to make sure it was properly locked. Made my daughter and I quite uncomfortable. Otherwise| it was nice. The beds were clean and comfortable.,0
The pool was very nice and clean and the city shuttle made the trip to Disneyland easy and convenient.,1
The check in was seamless. The young lady that helped me was so kind and attentive to my needs. Hands down a great stay! Not to mention it was in an awesome area!,1
I didn't like the parking fee too high and service. When I checked out and rush to the airport. The lady manager that day worked on the exit lane was  poor service. I chose her lane and it took around 10' for waiting. While another car on the other lane was the same distance my car.His car exited |  then 6 cars after him exited too. But| my car was still waiting behind 3 cars on my lane... ???,1
Overall was a good experience| I would recommended for my friends and family:)),1
Hotel is nice and updated.  Pool is smaller than the photos make it out to be and the hot tub is luke warm.  Food and drinks available on the pool cafe.  But hotel is too far away to walk to Disneyland entrance and they have no free shuttle to disneyland so you have to Uber/lift (city bus is 20$ for 4 people a day) to get to the disneyland entrance.  Too far for young children to walk.,1
the pool was fun| Starbucks closes way too early!!,1
So| accessible to the convention center in Anaheim | great with people with some walking difficulties.,1
It is located less then a mile from Disneyland| easy walking distance for us.  The front desk personnel was very helpful with upgrading to our need.  The room service lady was excellent!!!,1
It had a lot to offer where it was located to be able to walk around the area. It also had different options of food places and a nice atmosphere. The entire staff was friendly and helpfulThe guest room area hall was extremely noisy and the pull out couch was not made up to sleep in and was squeaky loud and uncomfortable,1
The Anaheim Hilton is always amazing!  Best rate in town in early June!,1
Overall the service was very good. The Internet connection| however| was extremely slow.,1
"My toilet was constantly running i called to have it fixed. They came up to the room in about 10 minutes which i thought was very satisfying and fixed the problem. Then after the next flush the toilet was back to constantly running and it was about 1130 at night now so i wasnt calling again. So i rigged the back of the tank to fill up once then flushed and reshut the water off. The next morning had to continuously turn the water on and off while the restroom was being used. We were headed to Disneyland so i was not going to wait for maintenance to come ""fix"" the problem. So shut the water off and we left. Then once we got back did the same thing over. Shutting the water off and on saved them 2 days of wasted running water. Called the people down stairs to give them the heads up that the water is shut off so it doesnt run while we check out. She said okay i will make a note of that on your account. Went down to check out| nothing was noted on my account that the bathroom was bad. Lady apologizes and gives me a $50 dollar discount. Okay fair fine whatever. BUT this is the part that rubs me wrong. While i was laying in bed the second night before i fell asleep i looked up and the fire alarm is wrapped in plastic. May not be a huge deal but i have been in a hotel where there was faulty wiring in the room a few down from me and their room filled with smoke luckily they had a fire alarm that went off and evacuated the floor. So the ""what if"" plays in my head. Who checks the rooms??",0
It was the worst hotel to stay in ever| the room was not as described in the pictures and way smaller| the cleanliness was zero| bathroom was like public bathroom| old cracked and unclean| doesn't worth the money| I checked out first thing in the morning since I've arrived midnight| disregard the bad smell inside the room.,0
rooms old and worn. bathroom smelled like mold. paid additional yo upgrade for a balcony room. definitely not worth it.,0
We had fly in our room dirty towels it eas just like a 2 star motel. Horrible experience.  Never going back,0
It's a very clean hotel.  I love how close it is to everything.  The convention center is a few feet away and Disneyland isn't that far.  The hotel is also located next to restaurants and stores.  If you forget anything there are stores close by.,1
The staff was incredibly helpful and conscientious. The hotel space was excellent and comfortable| we had a great stay,1
Didnt like anything.. didnt mention id have to pay for parking. Parking was an event in itself.. HORRIBLE experience.. ill never go back there,0
Close to Disney nice lobby and comfortable bed cleaned room fast,0
Friendly staff | Hotel is so big | we get lost everytime we try to walk to our room,1
It was an awesome place to stay.  Very clean| good location.,1
Very professinal clean helpfulListen to you great,1
The rooms we had were not clean nor maintained. We had a number of examples. Very loose faucet| handles falling off bathroom door| no picture on the wall ( just hooks where one used to be). It was also very dusty and stains on walls and curtains| along with insect drippings. Stayed here many times in the past. Returned for  this trip and it will be our last. It needs a returb and a proper clean between roomGuests.,0
Staff was great| hotel was bigger than expected. Was easy to book last minute.,1
Weather was great! Walking distance to Disney land.,1
Within walking distance to Disneyland. About a 20 minute walk to downtown Disney.,1
Our stay at Hilton Anaheim made our weekend away very nice.Staying here they have a food court| Starbucks and restaurants .The Hilton is close to Disneyland if you use the shuttle out front to go to Disneyland download app in advance RideART is the app we wish we would of known about this inadvance and bought the 3 day unlimited.The room was very clean and comfortable.,1
The hotel was close to many things and very comfortable. Nice friendly staff.,1
Great location and clean rooms! They have a Starbucks downstairs next to the lobby,1
Our room was not ready...sometimes understandable.. The greet staff tried to up-sell me on a different room rather than accommodating...must be a new sales program. Our room had a dead remote control for the TV| burned out light bulbs and unlike just about all the rest of the world| no WIFI unless we were HH members. Really??? Even roadside motels offer free WIFI. Lost me back to Marriott.,0
We plan to stay again next year.  We were there for business and we were put in a quiet zone.  Cool,1
Amazing stay we will definitely be back,1
Front desk was very nice. Good proximity for Disneyland. Clean rooms| cable tv| swimming pool and water slides/play activities for the kidos... amazing room price... starbucks in the lobby...  very nice amenities and lobby... this was our second visit| looking forward to the third .. the only con is the valet price - 26bucks (unlimited in/out) is a little steep but still well worth it considering the room bargain (valet ppl are extremely nice). Highly recommend staying. 9/10.,1
very accessible to the venue of my meeting| easy access to disneyland  but the facility is getting old and need improvement. building structure|and remodeling of each room. parking is very pricey for in house guest. it should be less for those houseguest.,1
Excelent service and clean rooms. Young lady at the counter was very helpful ans understanding,1
Property is relatively no-frills business oriented hotel.  Staff were friendly and helpful| very responsive. It's very convenient to take the ART shuttle to and from Disneyland Resort (used a 3 day pass)| which was the reason for our stay| and it was great to see the fireworks from our room (as advertised).  The pool area and room seemed dated/tired and bathroom lacked towel bars and was not ideally arranged for use by a family of 4.  But it suited our purposes well.,1
We have been staying here last couple times we came to Disneyland and most likely will again next time. They have a Starbucks| bar with good drinks| great customer service everywhere on the hotel grounds| and honestly anything that was needed. If they had free parking for guests it would've been perfect but sometimes we can't have everything. Thank you so much for everything Hilton team!,1
Hotel is massive and a pain in the butt to get even from the elevator to your room. Not worth the price. Rooms need a deep clean and a renovation.,0
Really clean| kept up and a short walk from Disneyland.,1
Looks great from outside. Absolutely awful on the inside. This hotel does not have free wifi in hotel rooms| they charge $13 per day for wifi. They also have nasty tap water in their rooms with an unpleasant coming from the sink drain. If you want drinkable water| you'll need to go to the Starbucks in the lobby| but they close every day at 4pm! Not to mention the water temperature at this hotel is awful. The shower water temperature will constantly fluctuate from warm to cold every minute| making showering an unpleasant experience. As a person passing through the lobby| I would call this a 4 star hotel. The one good experience I've had was getting an early check in. As a guest staying at the hotel| it's a 2 star hotel at best. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else.,0
Great hotel with awesome amenities| 15 min walk to Disneyland,1
Clean property. Good sized parking garage. Easy to navigate.,1
Great customer service and huge hotel| I'll definitely only be staying here when I'm in Anaheim.,1
Enjoyed our stay. Clean hotel with friendly staff and family-friendly. Ordered room service for breakfast| the food came quickly and was delicious.,1
Excelkent| but should not charge for the parking.. also the check was not email to me as I was told!..,1
This hotel is one of the biggest I've ever stayed in and I went in expecting that| given its right by the convention center and that Disney is right across the street. It was a little overwhelming but the staff was friendly and very clear on how to make my way around the hotel and the area. The guy at the desk even gave me a breakfast voucher for switching my room even though it wasn't that big of a deal| so that was very nice! I will definitely be staying here again when I get the chance.,1
Had an excellent time. Staff was very friendly and valet parking was just perfect after a long day in the park.,1
We have always enjoyed staying here.  Staff is very accommodating!,1
Clean| Organized| Professional staff. Definitely would stay again.,1
Great location| walking distance to surrounding attractions,1
It was a nice hotel and everything was clean but it was overpriced,1
Location next to convention center is the reason I would go back.,1
Friendly helpful staff| clean tidy room| facilities and lobby,1
The staff were very friendly and accommodating. Great communication. However| housekeeping doesn't do a very good job of cleaning the room. After my first night| I accidentally dropped an empty water bottle on the side of the night stand| completely forgot about it. The next day as I was picking up something| I saw an old lotion underneath the bed| left i there since I was going remove my DND sign to get my room cleaned| however upon returning .. I still saw the lotion underneath the bed and surprisingly the water bottle was still there. When I removed it| I saw that the back of the night stand was extremely dirty| and filled with dust. Also| I feel like they should update their TV and have USB ports.,1
I was not happy with the lack of ADA accommodations. The management stated that the third party I used (Expedia) did not list their limited accommodations. I had to be inconvenienced with my disabled person with the shower facilities!,0
starbucks| clean room| clean environment| and location,1
Great hotel. Huge lobby| so much to see. Very clean.,1
Great property to stay great price super convenient. Will stay there again fr sure.,1
Liked everything . Very friendly helpful staff !!!,1
The smell.  You walk in and the smell is a comforting| subtle hint of men's cologne...you know| the one that got away?  :) Entire hotel is beautifully decorated| clean and sooting... especially the smell! :),1
Property was fantastic. You walk in and it looks like a million bucks. Room was very outdated for the Hilton name. No room in the washroom. Very tiny| you had to stand between the sink and the toilet just to close the door.,1
Kids loved the facility especially the pool. We will be back!,1
Love stating here. Always stay here.  Awesome restaurant a. Convenient,1
Liked pool| rooms and. Lobby.Did not like no complimentary coffee.  Other hotels/resorts have coffee in lobby.Did not like that there was no shuttle via Hilton to Disneyland,1
It was a very nice hotel| exactly what you'd expect from Hilton.,1
Easy walk to Disneyland!!!,1
Room was very nice| with very comfortable beds.  The pool is ok.  The lobby smells too strongly of cleaning solutions.,1
AMAZING ... We typically stay at another hotel close by but not any longer!  This place was hands down amazing.,1
This was totally one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. Check in was quick and easy. All Staff was friendly and never had a problem with them. The pool area was a little busy but not over crowded. My room was clean and pretty spacious. Beds were very comfortable. So gals that I stayed in this Hilton Hotel and will definitely be coming back very soon.,1
Hotel is neat like I expected.Spacious room. Clean bathroom.,1
The service and amenities are amazing. Great place to stay..easy walk to Disney or by use of bus which comes by at short times. Wish they had more kid friendly things to do on our down time hanging out at the hotel especially the pool area which was smaller than i thought. Plus side was early.check in with no fees as well as easy to get around the area if u wanted too by car. Maybe wish they had deals to lighten the cost on parking or even for Honors members but i know thats a norm and not an amenity.  Overall great stay which is why we keep.coming back,1
The rooms could be updated. Our room just seem dated.,1
The service was terrible and the attitude of staff appalling,0
Clean rooms| huge lobby with access to a restaurant| bar| shopping| Starbucks| and 1 mile from Disneyland.,1
Loved everything about my stay at the hotel.will be back again,1
Went for a convention and the hotel is right next to the convention center. Friendly staff. Clean rooms. Clean facilities. Starbucks in the hotel and a food court too.  Very near Downtown Disney and Disneyland (you can walk from the hotel). Quiet environment. Parking though is a premium.,1
The hotel is very clean and confortable the checking was very easy and no problems at all!,1
The staff was friendly and incredible don't get me wrong my problem was that me and my girlfriend were hoping for a relaxing night and morning but the alarm in the room was set by the previous guest I think and was going off at 6am and then we managed to turn it off then 2 hours later the maid service I think it was started pounding on our back sliding door at 9 am which ruined our relaxing stay.,0
Great location..friendly staff| rooms were awesome.. everything was really nice,1
very very very very nice hotel!thats why i always stay with you guys!! my favorite hotel!,1
Great location| friendly service| clean| we don't like for big hotel network the WiFi is not free.,1
Hotel was very nice on inside but once you got to your room| it was less desirable. The drains in bathroom were clogged| smelled musty| and was not what we were expecting at all.,0
I didn't like on top of the hotel fees you had to pay to park. That was a first for me. But overall it was outstanding.,1
Massive property. ART access was simple and quick. Nice pool. Nice buffet.,1
Location was easy to navigate. Friendly staff. Clean and smells good.,1
It was so dirty. Pillows are smelly because it wasn't dry enough after washed. Table| light and phone are all dusty. Carpet is old and smell. We are totally disappointed of this hotel. We stayed for 3 nights at Hilton Anaheim and one night at Hilton LAX AIRPORT| Our family will never buy any Hilton hotel anymore.,0
Good hotel. Beds are a bit hard but I guess some people like that. Good location. Easy access to food and Disney. No shuttle so you walk or ubber. The pool isn't anything much. Rooms are nice and clean it the maids come at like 8am so keep your privacy tag on your door or they come in while you're still asleep. Good price. It feels more like a business hotel for the convention center then one for a family going to Disney.,1
the check person wasnt very knowlegble.kept making alot of mistakes took a long time.you have to pay to use the gym or wi-fi. nothing complimentry.,0
Just across the street from Disneyland! The room was large and spacious| and the gym was very well equipped! Staff were always friendly and the Starbucks option as an alternative to the complimentary breakfast was a nice touch! Looking forward to my next stay at the Hilton Anaheim.,1
Very good for my business conference| location nice and the hotel was in great shape,1
Super convenient location to Disneyland! You can walk but we opted for a 3 day shuttle unlimited pass for $14! There are tons of rooms since this is a convention center. Overall nice stay and would stay here again!,1
The front desk people were courteous and accommodating!,1
was nice and close to shops,1
Didn't really like the restroom wish it had a bad tub but o well,1
You guys lied about my breakfast at hotel. This is a last book with you.,0
I like how close it is to Disneyland and the convention center. The rooms and bathrooms could be updated a little.,1
Central location to alot of activity and hreat staff,1
Pillows were terrible otherwise great stay,1
Overall| it was ok. The rooms could have been a little nicer. For the price you pay| they have nothing that's complementary| they have coffee in the room| but you have to pay for the water to make it. No continental breakfast|  nothing. But it was a great area and the service is great. And you do have options within the hotel. Just a little pricey for everything.,1
Loved the location. Stayed for an event at the Convention Center and 3 days at Disneyland. :),1
It was with in walking distance and everything from the service to the room to the food was great. Very family friendly. They let us borrow a baby bed. It was just great.,1
Property clean| however food served was cold. Also| upon check in I was told my room wasn't ready and a text message would be sent. Never received one and ended up waiting 3 hours,1
Perfect hotel for Disneyland or the convention center.,1
Convenient to important locations.  Walking distance and shops.,1
May have been the worst night‚Äòs sleep that I've ever had. Walls are thin| and the hallway sounded like a high school cafeteria until 4 am. Called the front desk to deal with the noise| but nothing happened. Would definitely avoid staying here in the future.,0
Clean and convenient.  Seems to be there is not enough staff in some occasion.,1
Tons of staff around for help and easy access to convention center and Disneyland!,1
Staff was awesome| all the way to the bellhops. Made our stay feel special| even went out of their way to accommodate us when we wanted to stay another day. Definitely going to stay here again when we come back down to Anaheim. Met the manager to express our satisfaction as well. Good job Anaheim Hilton!!,1
The property was nice| the traffic to access the hotel was a nightmare due to a large convention ending as we were checking in.,1
Awesome service and very convenient location,1
Nice hotel rooms a very basic but everything elseWas great!!,1
The lobby area was modern and updated. There's a Starbucks but it had odd hours of operation. Room service also closed in middle of day which is a negative for me since being at Disneyland we took breaks in middle of day. Also the rooms were nice but not updated at all.,1
Wonderful hotel at a great price close to the happiest place on earth,1
The only thing negative was Starbucks isn't open in the evening.,1
The hotel was extremely clean and the staff was friendly and supportive! I was on the 5th floor and the view was remarkable! The only thing was the door that leads into the patio was always open! It made the hallway extremely cold and uncomfortable!,1
The amount of places to get food that was reasonably priced.,1
The service was absolutely fantastic! The staff was super nice and helpful and our room was very clean,1
First check in attendant was really mean...was not helpful like informed me my room would not be ready until 5pm and that i could pay an additional of $30 per day to get my room right away...i got off the line went to another check in rep her name was Laura she informed me that the room is not ready but she would text me and should not take that long...and asked i preferred an email or text and that i could leave my luggage an the desk while she arranges it.and that the room should not take longer than 1 pm..that she actually thinks it would be ready by 12pm. and thats what really happened she had texted me by 12pm that it was ready amazing customer service... the other reps name was Yvony or i dont know i asked Laura.,1
Beautiful hotel excellent service top notch amenities! I will definitely be staying here again.,1
It was a close walk to Disneyland.  The room was nice and big although not enough mirrors.,1
Room service manager knew i'd had a long day of travel so sent a paper straw to my room woth my bottle of wine. Great sense of humor. Beautiful hotel| clean| convenient| classy,1
Great hotel conveniently located across the convention center.,1
The property is in a great location-close to the convention center and a variety of businesses.My only problem was with the delivery of my luggage the first night. After waiting for 30 minutes| I had to retrieve it myself.,1
Huge hotel. Messy and noisy. Maybe for conference type venue. Not for family.,0
1st off | I paid extra $50 for upgrade still it's not an upgrade The hotel lobby is fancy and everything but the room we had very disappointed| NO MICROWAVE EVERYTHING IS SQUEEGEEING OLD THE DUVET OMG THE BEDDINGS IS OLD MY GOD I CAN GO AND ON AND ON HILTON YOU EXPECT GOOD| but no THEY GAVE US THE NOT SO GOOD ROOM| I can get the room like that in holiday in !!!! NEVER AGAIN,0
Staff was VERY friendly and helpful! Easy to get things done like check in and out. I would go back for sure.,1
I did not like being in a room that has a connecting door to the next room,1
It was an amazing stay and everyone was really nice and personable! One of the valet workers even drove us to Downtown Disney so we didn't have to walk.,1
We stayed for the night after disney after dark. The bed was the perfect comfort for our tired bodies. Close enough to disneyland to walk and very affordable. Staff was very friendly as well.,1
All services around price little to high for the pkace,1
The air conditioning in the room was not working| maintenance had to be notified.  The repair was made.  The water pressure in the shower was not all that great.  I expected a better quality room considering it was the Hilton.   I have stayed at less expensive hotels| with better water pressure.,1
Hotel is very big very close to disney staff was great. Good food. Beds confy.,1
Great location for Disneyland| very friendly & helpful staff. Good size rooms| thank you we enjoyed our stay.,1
DO NOT STAY...employees are on strike every morning since 6am banging equipment and making noise outside of the hotel until 9am| called the front desk they said there's nothing they can do and aren't allowed to issue a refund? Now I've got a toddler crying and a cranky wife what was suppose to be a late checkout/ sleep in has now been a 6 hour sleep.,0
We had a great stay.   Really liked that they had a Starbucks and a restaurant court.,1
Love everything hilton except the arking fees,1
Staff and employees are very nice and top of everything.,1
Additionally| the Hilton insisted that I had to be charged $21 for parking. Although I explicitly informed the attendant upon check-in that I would prefer to pay as I exited the parking lot| it was added to my room bill. The total cost upon departure would have been only $16.,0
We were visiting to attend a family member's wrestling match and go to Disneyland. We have stayed at this property 5 or 6 other times over the years and it is a nice hotel.  I marked service as average| due to the length of time it takes to check-in.  This is something I have commented on over the years and it has never been addressed.  We stood in line for 15 minutes with only 5-6 people in front of us.  The hotel had 3 counters open to check in guests and it was just slow.  This experience would not deter me from staying there again| just plan to wait in line for a while when checking in.,1
Close proximity to Disney was preferred. Appreciated the late hours that the lounge was open.,1
Beautiful room but protesters were making loud noises starting at 4:30 in the morning in the public area below. Mentioned to desk and they immediately moved us to an upgraded room overlooking the pool. Excellent service,1
Very nice and close to everything. Staff very friendly.,1
Nothing was what was promised or showed online. Service was poor. No help was provided,0
Clean and comfortable. Wish front desk would of asked me if i was a member. Lost my points,1
Nice hotel close to Disney,1
It was clean and comfortable and safe.  Enjoyed staying there.,1
The pool area is great. I like that is has a Starbucks and other easy to-go dining options. I wish the breakfast buffet was more affordable. It is tasty| but $28 is crazy. It can be a VERY along walk to your room depending on where you are (.20 miles for us). They were able to provide us with adjoining rooms| which we really appreciated. We had to call twice to get both a roll away bed and extra blankets.,1
Very nice hotel| was very clean. Lacked the Disney feel being so close to Disney.,1
Room was dirty with trash under the in room fridge. Got over charged for the roll away bed and am still waiting on billing calling me back to get my refund. This was a huge disappointment as we have stayed at this hotel many times- guess we need to find a new hotel.,0
Very good hotel for the price if you're going to Disney or the convention center. Has lots of services and amenities on property.,1
Everything was great except for the protest held outside.  Starting around 0530 on Jan 2nd people started banging drums and blowing whistles for about 2.5 to 3 hrs.  I was able to fall back asleep but many guests couldn't and complained.  Not sure if this was an isolated event or a regular occurrence like at the Marriott Hotels.,1
Far from Disney to walk too short to drive| find other hotels nearby. outdate carpets and room locations are like puzzle,0
Hair (of various types) in the bath tub. Tub stop didn't work| nor did the button to turn the shower off and tub back on after running the shower.,1
Nice hotel close to Disneyland no need to rent a car even just to and from airport other than that the shuttle is great,1
Disliked fee's were not included with booking price,1
Stay was great. Cleaniness could be better in the rooms.,1
Well. Let me just say| I'm not a fan of Hilton in general. I don't like their business model (over charging you for every little thing). Having to pay for basic Internet at $12 per day is just insane. I would also say that it was a bit misleading. The amenities listed fitness center and indoor pool should be clearer. The fitness center is not free. It's $15 per day. The indoor pool is inside the fitness center and it's for 16 and older. So| my 4 and 6 years old were stuck to swim in the outdoor pool which they didn't mind at all.Parking was fine compared to other facilities in the area. The hotel was very busy| so expect the service to be the same| quickly get in quickly get out. However| the staff were professional at all the time. The person that was keeping our room was very nice and professional.The first day| the valet person who I also think serves as security or some sort of gate keeper| instructed us to go directly to the parking if we are not planning to use the valet service. This was strange and really unnecessary. We had lot of baggage to whole and we needed help. So we returned back and used the front entrance instead. The following days| I just ignored them and passed through them. They didn't like it for sure.Since Disneyland was not our only destination| it was challenging moving through the traffic. Expect one to two hours to get to anywhere else. By LA standards| this is normal.,1
Our experience was great. The staff was great and knowledgeable about any questions we had. Our room was clean and the view was spectacular. We went around Christmas time so it was a little cold at the pool but my kids still had a great time. Pool was heated. This hotel is located close to a lot of great places to eat. We will be going back next summer for sure.,1
This was a very nice property with great amenities for my family vacation to Disneyland.  The proximity to many great restaurants and activities was a great fit.,1
We came for Christmas vacation to take the kids to Disney.  Great location!,1
Loved the complimentary hot cocoa bar in the evening and Christmas atmosphere! Fabulous location and stay.  I'd definitely stay again.,1
Family Time,1
Everything was great from the moment I arrived. Staff was friendly and very helpful,1
It was a great stay and I will definitely return.  Thank you staff at the Hilton!  You were great!!!,1
The staff were very friendly and helpful. The area was quiet yet close to Disneyland.,1
The hotel was very crowded with not enough elevators.  The Starbucks onsite was awesome but they closed at 4pm every day.  Our room was ok.  The HVAC unit was very noisy. There was a loud clanging noise.  Service was good.  Without me asking they put all of my three room reservations right next to each other.,1
It's my first and worst experience with Hilton. I called Hilton 3 days in advance to know if they provide Microwave in the room and they told me I can request one which I did. I called  Hilton on my day of my checkin around 7 pm  PDT   as I was running late due to traffic and also enquirer about the microwave| they told me it would be there in the room. I finally checked in before 12 am and when I reached  the hotel room there was no microwave and there was cold in the room. Though I was tired after driving for 10 hours and went down to know where's the microwave and also requested for blankets as it was too cold in the room and I tried adjusting the temperature which didn't work. The front desk executive told me it would'be there in 15-20 mins plus there would be charge waited  for an hour and again went down to check on microwave and blankets and it was around 1:30 so this time I asked for a manger and explained him the situation. I could only get one blanket and no news on microwave and after waiting till 2am I tried sleeping by putting the jackets on. I requested for microwave since my daughter was sick So we can give her something warm. So due to extreme cold in the room my daughter started coughing and I had to call my doctor. The Manger didn't bothered to call metocueck how are things though they were terrible. Again I went down in the morning as asked for a Senior person who can understand my concern. I spoke to Fred- Assistant Director Front desk operation. Finally I,0
Beautiful hotel. Enjoyed our stay. Great staff. Not very amenities :( also wish the pool was opened passed 10!,1
No free WiFi,0
Smells like cigarettes. Requested to change rooms. Was told no rooms available but can have security come and another house cleaning. I wanted to change rooms instead. With lots of persistence| the lady was able to get me a room with no cigarette smell.,0
Very nice view overlooking Disneyland. We got to see the fireworks.,1
There was a food court and a Starbucks and the hotel which provided an alternative to the hotel restaurants!,1
It was excellent everyone very attentive| right on the heart of Disney!  thanks so much,1
TV service was not working in the room.  The shower/tub handle was very loose. I never received my hotel bill via email.,1
Let me start off by saying I have stayed at many Hilton property's and always enjoyed my stay but from the start at this property it was horrable I called tore about an early check in the person who answered the phone was not friendly acted more like he was annoyed and bothered so not a very good start but I well say the room was nice clean great view and the people at the front greeting and opening the door where very friendly and the only people who asked how I was later on when I called about a letter check out and To see about an issue wiTh my rentle car since they have an enterprise there once again the person on the other line was not present rude befor I even finished addressing what I needed he hung up like I finished so had to call back overall not happy with my experience and we'll not be returning to this hotel,0
The hotel staff is friendly and helpful.    It was decorated for Christmas| it was very festive.,1
It is a lovely hotel with all the amenities--to be recommended!,1
Great hotel except for the handicap bathroom. Shower was so small and we were unable to shower easily. We are not handicap and we're disapinted with the room. The doors got very wet because of the shower being open and my husband and I both almost slipped and feel because of the water. The staff was great and the location was good for going to Disneyland,1
Nice hotel and room. We enjoyed our stay there. Staff was friendly and helpful. Room was clean and comfortable. Room service was fast and food was great. The bar and buffet restaurant in the lobby were great and convenient. My only concern was this...we stayed on the 7th floor and the floor of the hall was noticeably bowed and slightly slanted. Our room floor was also slightly slanted lol. Not sure what the means but it worried me a lil bit lol. Other than that everything was great.,1
The hotel lobby area was nice| but the room felt old and shabby. The hotel is very large and the hallways are very long and felt a little dreary. We ordered a drink from the bar which was very expensive| as was room service| but that is to be expected at most hotels. If I were to stay again| I would definitely upgrade to a nicer room.,1
I love how the hotel just feels safe. The staff is great. The location for Disneyland is perfect. I had a day to explore Santa Ana (friend who lives there insisted i visit there) and it was super close. Packing House is so close (Look it up and GO!) I will be back for another stay soon =],1
Very good.  Hilton is our preferred hotel for our California trips,1
It was amazing for our first family vacation to Disneyland!,1
The hotel is close to disneyland ( 15 min walk ) The staff was very friendly and helpful.Very clean inside and the rooms were always made up in a timely manner,1
Hotel was beautiful and had excellent services.,1
Overall nice and clean. Staffs are friendly and helpful. Good place to stay.,1
I have previously given a statement regarding my stay. The low light would be the semen stains on the headboard which I did not discover until the middle of the night as I was tired when I first entered the room from a long day at Disneyland with my family.  It appears they were more stains on the dust ruffle on the west side of the bed near the flightellipses Disgusting .  For the price that I paid I would've expected more especially under the Hilton name. But apparently on the fifth floor and the 300 wing the gas around is valued as the room was rather shabby| lacking a microwave|  couch table etc.    when I call the concierge about the fact that the ice machine on my floor was not functioning| I thought he might send a snap to me| but instead he told me to search the other wing of the floor  for another ice machine.  I also find it funny that the Wi-Fi is not free unless you're a special member to the Hilton hotel franchise. I've stayed at many hotels of lesser status than Hilton with much nicer rooms and better amenities.   It just seems in less I spent $400 a night I wouldn't have a room that I would expect staying at the Hilton. It seems it and I was considered riffraff as I was using Hotels.com and getting cheaper rooms. I'm assuming that's what the fifth floor is for at least a 300 wing.  I suppose I expected too much. Free Wi-Fi perhaps some type of continental breakfast or at least some coffee.   There was no couch| the tv was tiny and the bathroom was shabby.,0
The staff was wonderful.  Clean and comfortable room. The food was awesome.,1
Charging for parking was a major negative. I've stayed at other hotels nearby that do not charge for parking.,1
It was super easy to check in and check out. Loved it and will stay again in the future.,1
Overall great......some rooms are a little outdated.,1
Our experience was close to wonderful: The Bell Captain services at checkout (December 2nd) was outstanding (name tag says ‚ÄúDJ‚Äù). Our only inconvenience was upon our arrival (check-in date| December 1st). Although we have the DMV California Disabled Placard| the Vallet Parking staff did not allow us to park in a Disabled parking spot near the main entrance| stating it's reserved for Vallet Parking only. They told us we need to go to the multi floor parking building (which I did). I called the police to confirm the rules| and they said if I have the placard| the hotel cannot stop us from using it| regardless of its location. They were willing to come for a formal complaint| but I said I would try to resolve it by myself. I then explained this to the hotel night manager| and she gave instructions to hotel staff to finally allow us to park there. Then a pizza delivery person parked his vehicle there and I had to wait till he returned| to then move my vehicle. All staff should be trained and instructed properly| and point out to not give priority to vallet customers over regular parking customers. This made us get to sleep much later than otherwise| as it was already way past midnight when we arrived at the Hilton Anaheim. Thanks.,1
Staff was friendly and place is beautiful at Christmas time. My son loved the super hero tree,1
Good facility comfortable bed and pillows. Jacuzzi was hot.,1
This place has amazing service with very nice employees. Only issue I had was that the bed wasn't so comfortable| I woke up with a little bit of back pain. But overall it's still a great place!,1
Very nice and clean.  Great customer service,1
Great amenities| very clean| and friendly/helpful staff. We enjoyed a great breakfast in the morning before heading out for our day at Disneyland - will definitely return again!,1
The bathroom in our room was not cleaned very well| toilet was dirty.,0
Cleanliness an comfortable beds. Reastuant was good as well,1
The people were very friendly and helpful.  Room was clean and had a great view of the pool.,1
Wifi suck room was dirty beds comfy staff nice I did like it but room was not to my expectations,1
I love Hilton,1
Nice hotel very close to Disneyland with a shuttle available that runs continually while the park is open.,1
Hotel was nice. Room was clean and cool. AC was a bit noisy. Shower was rough regarding water pressure. Also there was a pipe sticking out of the ceiling above the tub. Staff was great and friendly.,1
The valet guys were awesome.  The girl who checked us in wasn't the friendliest.  Overall though it was a great stay.  I love the keurig in the room.,1
The room could be more beautiful. Looks some old...,1
A very mediocre property and underwhelming experience. Expect only a 2-3 star hotel and subpar service so you don't get disappointed in the Hilton brand.,0
Nice hotel| room was really nice and clean| close to a lots of dining options| service was really good as well| thank you,1
Very nice hotel and a 10-15 minute walk to Disneyland. It's a large hotel| got lost walking to my room but I wasn't paying attention to room signs so it's my fault. Ice machine was broken so I had to find another one and only had vending machines for drinks and no snacks. Gift shop was closed but it was late.,1
Great staff all around but the rooms were very out dated. First room tried to stay but three hours into sleep there was so much banging from the elevators we couldn't sleep and asked to be moved which thankfully they allowed. First room didn't even have the sheets tucked in| there were cobwebs in both the bathroom and main room. Tv was small and old. Bathroom door would not shut all of the way and everything has a slight yellow tinge to it and the ac vent wasn't fully attached to the wall. Second room was slightly better ie the bathroom door shut| no cobwebs and not loud banging from the elevator but still for the Hilton that is suppose to be third largest in the US and for the prices we paid sooooo disappointing and gross. Now the pics on their site show pretty great spots and I agree their lobby and amentities at awesome but I can't sleep in the lobby. Also the breakfast there was almost 30 per person| food was really good but pretty pricey.,0
Amazing and beautiful hotel| with amazing service!,1
"It was great value! We were in an 11th floor room. The floor seemed ""warped"" and that our room floor also seemed like we were walking uphill.",1
What a beautiful hotel. Great rooms. Walking distance to Disneyland. Staff was awesome.,1
We enjoyed staying at this hotel. We will definitely come back. We highly recommend this place.,1
Everything was very expensive with marginal quality,0
Wi-Fi was terrible,0
It's not always fun being at a convention. But having a nice room with good staff make it doable.,1
Overall| everything was great. We were there for Disney and after taking the bus on the first morning| we realized it was very walkable. The pool was fun though the ‚Äúsplash park‚Äù was crazy cold. Food court was a nice option for reasonably priced meals with the family. Service was great and efficient. The price was only 20% of what we were seeing for the park hotels so it was absolutely the best deal,1
Property was nice. Onsite amenities were overpriced and not many food locations withing walking distance.,1
This hotel connects to the convention center and features any of the services you may need for a productive business trip. The rooms are clean| bed comfortable| pillows fantastic and although the hotel is aging| the maintenance crew really does a great job in attempts to keep up. The lobby bar is a great place to network.,1
I Ioved the Starbucks and convenience of getting to Disneyland,1
Great hotel| very large with a simple layout. Parking was simple and while you have to pay I still found it convenient. Enjoyed my stay and would recommend it to anyone coming to the area.,1
Went to Disney| easy access and convenient,1
Very|very comfortable beds and pillows. The bath towels were large and soft. Size and cleanliness of the room was good. There are not enough choices of restaurants in the hotel. Either very expensive or fast food - nothing in the middle. Sometimes you want to be served in a restaurant but not pay exorbitant prices. All in all a great stay.,1
Good location. This is the second stay at the Hilton Anaheim. I believe the foundation is slanted. You can tell when walking around your room. We were on the 6th floor. I slept by the window and heard clicking noises all night.,1
The person who checked us in| Diane| was outstanding. If I ever go back it would be sole because of how well she treated us.,1
Great hotel close to Disneyland! Coffee pot didn't work properly| but other than that| everything is wonderful.,1
Great place it was close to everything walking distance 20 min walk to Disneyland,1
It was a good stay,1
My stay at Hilton was amazing! I loved the room and loved the bar/restaurant area. This hotel is so accomadating and was great for our Disneyland stay! I will forever stay at this Hilton when I visit Anaheim.,1
Very satisfied will be staying there again next time I'm in Anaheim,1
Hotel amenitie3s were ok.  $5 for bottled water!!!!! NO hotel shuttle to Disneyland| but there was a city bus that was pretty reasonable.  Overall| the hotel is very good.,1
It was close to Disneyland and the staff was helpful| courteous| and friendly.,1
It was clean and easily accessible from the freeway.,1
Always a wonderful stay here. Worth every penny. Clean rooms available resources,1
Close to convention center and Disney. Kid friendly menu options. Food court has food options and there is a Starbucks onsite.,1
I've stayed at many Hilton's around the world and other hotels| this by far was the worse.  For the price we pay to stay at a Hilton we should have stayed at a motel 6 or something similar to at least get a clean room! To think we upgraded to a suite because it would be nicer...Our door had a two inch gap beneath it so we can hear everything in the hall way| the towels and bathroom looked like someone else just used it| the floor/carpet was not vacuumed and the light switches did not work.,0
Nice proximity to the Disneyland Resort... walking distance of the Anaheim Garden Walk which is the location for several restaurants like PF Chang's and Cheesecake Factory.,1
Horrible. Very run down.  Not as depicted on the website.,0
The only bad experience was with the pillows| they were too soft and gave me a neck ache.,1
We liked the location as it's a few minutes from Disneyland.,1
Very close to Disneyland| staff was friendly and helpful. Beds were pretty stiff.,1
Everything in this hotel is basic you're paying for the name Hilton there's much nicer places to stay that offer more amenities such as breakfast free parking the only convenience this hotel is its proximity to Disneyland other than that this place is basic the hotel staff is great everything else is below average,0
Great hotel close to attractions and helpful staff,1
Wonderful experience overall. We have Hilton Gold status so got free continental breakfast for everyone in our room,1
This hotel was impressively clean| friendly and near Disneyland.  When we come back| we WILL choose to stay here!,1
The room was clearly not cleaned| no garbage bags in the trash cans| tc remote on the floor| handprints on the mirrors| not vacuumed. Hotel staff was snappy when I asked for directions twice. I would not stay here again.,0
Really disappointed with this hotel. Everything is an up charge. $9 for use of the gym and the pool. Broken glass in our room that I used to drink out of| shower curtain kept sliding to the middle because it was not level and the curtain was old and ripped at the top. For the price I would stay somewhere else.,0
Overall is good. Check out speed fast. The facility is new.,1
Close to Disney land park and we did not have to spend to much on transportation,0
Close walk to restaurants and about 20 mins from Disney,1
Have never slept so comfortable like we did in the hilton anaheim hotel definately would love to stay again in the future !,1
Great location. Everything was good i can see it getting too busy during peak summer time due to close proximity with Disneyland,1
"Lady that checked us in was awesome! Super friendly| went over & above. Room we were given was not ""city view"" as we booked. And they wanted to charge us extra for a pool view or Disney view. NOPE. Pool was super small for as large as this hotel is. There was ZERO seating left at the pool for us when we got there. Really like the extra games on the patio deck. Our room was small. Sink was cracked. Shower water pressure good. Walk from self parking garage to elevators to lobby to registration to your room is L O N G . Beware. Would stay again| but its a bit overpriced for what you get & self parking is $25 I think? Receptionist told us it was a 15 min walk to Disneyland. Nope- it took us 25 minutes to walk there with all the foot traffic| the crowds & all the lights you have to wait for. Its a very far walk!",1
"2 blocks from Disneyland| we used ART buses which pick you up and drop you off right in front of the hotel. Clean rooms and nice staff. One of our ""go to"" hotels if the price is right.",1
The hotel was very close to Disneyland| we were able to walk there. However| I wish I was able to do mobile order for the Starbucks| the line was extremely long in the mornings.,1
The Internet and WiFi was down randomly with no reason.,0
We love staying at this hotel. Very convenient if you're going to Disneyland or downtown Disney.,1
I felt like I was in Vegas. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The beds are to die for. Your body just melts. I would definitely recommend this Hotel.,1
I enjoyed my two day stay. It was near Disneyland.,1
Our stay was amazing. When we checked in to our hotel the first day the woman that helped us asked if it was any special occasion that were here for and I told her our 1 year wedding anniversary and she upgraded us to a suite they had open. With no charge. It was a nice gesture. Our stay was very nice regardless and the restaurant was very good too,1
Staff very frazzled,0
Hoyle staff were helpful and friendly,1
Had to pay for parking and to use the gym. This should be included in cost for stay.,1
It was a good location.,1
Wonderful hotel. Had a great room and the food at the restaurant Mix was delicious.,1
Close to Disneyland. Hotel is nice with everything u need in the lobby. Even a Starbucks......Pool is a tad small for the hotel size but has a great play area for the kids.  Rooms are comfortable and staff were really nice.  Coming back next month!!,1
Everyone and everything was great except the hot water in the shower. When I tested the temperature with my foot| the water was scalding hot and my foot is still bothering me. I burned it Thursday night|September 13| 2018| and it now is Sunday morning| September 16| 2018.There's no real reason to have the water that hot.,1
Good location and clean room with helpful staff however be prepared for a bit of a hike to Disneyland. There is however a bus that will take you to Disneyland.,1
The lobby was really nice but the upstairs was dingy.  The bed was uncomfortable and moved a lot when you moved.  The door was a sliding door and didn't close all the way.  Wouldn't be my number one choice to stay again.  Staff very friendly and helpful.,1
I stayed 3 nights with hilton. The first night i seen a few ants. The next night the ants increased. By the 3rd night they were literally in my bed. I expressed to the front desk but very little compassion or concern was shown. Hotel was a little worn but lobby is beautiful.,0
Nice hotel with comfy beds and a small mini fridge and coffee maker. We stayed here so we could be within walking distance of Disney and it was within walking distance but a about a solid 20-25 minute walk since the park is so giant. We got our steps in! Only things I didn't like were the required parking charge of $21 a day to park our car in their lot as there is no other parking option and no free wifi. Other than that it was great!,1
Excellent 15-20 minute Walking Distance to Disneyland,1
It was a very pleasant experience for my first time stayed at Hilton Anaheim.  The King bed is very comfortable and I had very good nights sleep.  The air in the room is fresh and there was no noise at night.,1
We went for an overnight trip to Disney. The staff was amazing| the rooms were great and the breakfast buffet was AMAZING Monday morning!,1
The host at check in was very friendly and the room was comfortable,1
They did a great job taking care of my family! It was my wife's Birthday and they went out of their way to make her happy!,1
We had a great time staying at the Hilton,1
Very good service| safe | great location| very nice hotel.  Very happy stay.    Breakfast buffet very good.  I would fully recommend this hotel.,1
Great hotel close to Disneyland. Across from toy story parking lot. Great lobby and bar,1
The hotel was beautiful and the staff was very nice but the room seemed like a small closet at the end of the hall. You have to cram into the bathroom to get through the door and close it. And the floor was at a downward slope going toward to door. Not a bad experience but I quickly figured out why I got the room for so cheap.,1
Direction guide to the rooms are very confuse.naanaanaanananananananana,1
It was nice. Everything was very clean and organized. Front desk was very helpful and checked us in quickly.,1
Beds are kind of worn and we're dipped where a person lays.,1
In summary| we will not be returning. Should've stayed closer to the park in a motel| at least then the service would be warranted. First Hilton stay and probably the last.,0
The staff was amazing here our room was so cool we were facing the Disneyland fireworks it was exactly what we wanted and the hilton delivered. Great place to stay.,1
Staff was terribly rude| the rooms we're a mess| worst place I've ever stayed in! I wouldn't spend 10 dollars to stay here let alone 1000,0
My room was not cleaned properly and fridge didn't work. However they brought me another fridge.,1
Very nice and clean| close to Disneyland and restaurants,1
Stayed at this location previously. Close to Disneyland shuttles.,1
Walking distance to Disneyland| also they have bus service to and from Disneyland Disneyland. $$ 4.00 round trip. Restaurant close by.,1
I had to request to move due to layout of siuite,0
View of fireworks was awesome.  Add a bit more to my review,1
no wifi in the room| complained after 2 days stay was then provided a password,1
The staff make this place. I have never stayed at a hotel where all the staff where so polite and helpful. Would certainly stay again.,1
Cleanliness is a must when I stay at a hotel and it was lacking...from the carpet to the restroom. Housekeeping needs to do a better job. I will never stay at a Hilton again.,0
I was really disappointed in this Hilton.  I choose it based on the reviews| pictures| and its location.  The remote control for the TV was duct taped together| the shower was clogged| the furniture was shabby| and the mattresses were well worn and needed to be flipped or replaced. The door to the bathroom was in the style of the sliding barn doors but there wasn't a tract on the ground so when you tried to open/close the door| it was difficult due to the thickness of the carpet.  Also| because there wasn't said tract| it did not seal all of the way so there wasn't 100% privacy.,0
Great price for such a beautiful hotel.,1
Transportation was not free to Disneyland. Rooms were disappointing.,0
Was a great stay. Lovely room and hotel amenities were excellent,1
This hotel is a perfect place to stay for a Disneyland visit.  A shuttle| five dollars for adults and two for children| takes you to right to the park. The hotel is clean| well appointed| and the staff is great.,1
Staff very friendly| gorgeous hotel| rooms clean and very comfortable. Close to so much! We really enjoyed our stay and Sam Smith concert we were here to attend!,1
After paying over $170 for one room a night you dont get free breakfast| no free parking| they charge you $5 for each small bottle of water in the room ... as a brand this is ridiculous|,0
The staff was friendly but the hotw room smelled like it was musky and moldy - we woke up with awful sore throats because the room felt wet,0
Always happy to stay at the Hilton| consistent service| love their beds| toiletries| cleanliness,1
my wife and I stayed and it was pleasant we had no problems.,1
Very comfortable room.  Excellent customer service.  Great value for being so close to Disneyland!,1
It was not clearly stated that the gym facilities would be an additional cost.   JW Marriott and Marriott Marquis do not charge additional for their gym facilities.  That was very disappointing.,1
love this hotel,1
I didn't use the facilities. The room was clean and check in was fast. I arrived late (11:30 pm) and checked out at 9am.,1
Our stay was great.  We got the hotel at a very cheap price and felt that it was worth every penny compared to the other hotels in this area.  Hotel was clean| workers were nice and it was nice having a starbucks in side the hotel.  The hotel could improve on their breakfast buffet prices and also their parking fees.,1
Easy to transportation for Disney and walk to convention center.  Perfect for us.,1
Very unimpressive rooms. Old| dingy| low ceiling. Noisy old AC. Bathroom partly renovated| but the bathtub old and worn. The play area by the pool is extremely old and worn. Low celing in the corridors| dark carpet. Parking extremely expensive| and they charged for a whole extra night when we left the car in the carage just a few hours after check out. We're never staying at the Hilton again.,0
TODO ME GUSTO MUY AMABLE EL PERSONAL TODO MUY LIMPIO LA COMIDA DEL HOTEL TODO MUCHA SGRACIAS,1
The room was very clean and spacious.  We were able to see the Disneyland Resort fireworks.  The area was also quiet and we felt safe.,1
Wow this was a great stay.  It's been a long time since I've had a positive hotel üè® experience.  The front desk staff made checking in very easy and the hotel is very kid-friendly.  The room was large| comfortable and very clean.  For what you pay| this hotel is an amazing value.  This will be my go-to when we visit disneyland,1
We had a great stay here at sun coast. Its a beautiful hotel. Nice pool area. The beds were comfy. Spacious suite. Staff friendly and attentive. Only downside was parking is not included in the price. I would recommend staying here.,1
So clean and beds are very comfortable| walking distance to Disneyland| parking is 24$ but that is reasonable for the location|  I felt safe with my kids at all times | and the room was exceptionally clean| staff is friendly I hope to stay here again !,1
Horrible staff| horrible service. Mediocre hotel| cleanliness| and jacuzzi is always broken with towels never being restocked or issues never resolved. The location is great though?Spent over 2|000 dollars and a week stay‚Äî Mish (the ‚Äúmanager‚Äù) and Fernando who was the man that was up front to check us in and out| bad mouthed my husband and I when we voiced our concerns and unhappiness with the property. Manager did nothing while hearing how horrible we were talked to and offered no type of resolution.  we had to fight and call corporate (which took another few days and hours) to get THE MINIMUM type of compensation. All around waste of time when guests are treated so horribly. Wasted so much time of our stay trying to be heard and understood.,0
Loved how close it was to Disneyland and Gardenwalk.,1
Nice hotel! Staff was very friendly and nice. Close walking distance to Disneyland.,1
We didn't get housekeeping service it was a horrible experience when we called front desk they said that they couldn't help cause we booked it with Experia and not them.,0
We did an early check-in and had a pleasant experience because the early check-in fee was waived. Never had our beds made or anything like that| wasn't  made aware that we had to call for this service.The bar doesn't open on Sunday which is disappointing. Cocktails that the bar were good. Had microwave and fridge in the room which was nice. AC worked well. 24 hour desk which is nice| they have a store where they have food and some other little extra things which was nice| came in handy. Walking distance from Disneyland. Gas station| food| really AWESOME PLAZA right down the street; Amazing options for entertainment and food.,1
The hotel is pretty new & very clean,1
Quiet| clean| and friendly staff. Nice pool area.  Very large room!  Perfect for our family of five.,1
Stay was amazing! Scott the bartender was on top of pool drink orders and David at the front desk was great during a middle of the night snack run! We will definitely return!,1
Loved how easy it was to travel around the city| loved the spacious room| and thoroughly enjoyed the friendly staff!,1
Had a wonderful stay at the hotel,1
Very nice hotel!  Clean and comfy!,1
The hotel manager was able to upgrade us to an bigger room after I realized my original room was too small for our family.,1
I booked two rooms for 3 nights to go visit Disneyland. When I was at the park at 10 pm I received a phone call from the hotel wondering if I wanted to extend my stay because I hadn't check out already and they had me in their system for 2 nights. I clarified my stay was for 3 nights since the beginning. I was then told I needed to go to the lobby to check in again| but not to worry because I didn't have to change rooms! This was a horrible experience because of course when I came into the hotel my kids were exhausted and falling asleep in the lobby and I had to go through the whole ordeal of paying a deposit of 100 again and getting new keys. They didn't even apologize for this experience. They told me I must have made different reservations for 2 and 1 night|  I said that was not the case| my reservations were for 3 nights since the beginning. By the way| they haven't even cleaned the room or picked up the trash in my whole stay. When they saw how unhappy I was with the experience they said: we are just the night crew. That's a terrible answer. This was my third stay at this hotel and I had recommended it to other people in the past. So disappointed with the bad service I received.,0
It lies on its website stating it has breakfast or free parking/wifi. 25 dollars a day for Parking is outrageous.,0
This hotel was perfect for a Disneyland trip. 15 minute walk to the park and had a nice pool| jacuzzi| and clean rooms. The front desk employees were very helpful and nice. I will definitely stay again next time I'm in town.,1
The Hotel was clean. Staff was friendly.,1
Walking distance to Disneyland. Can watch the Disneyland fireworks from our room. Clean and comfort environment overall.,1
Very nice and clean,1
I lake because is really close to Disney,1
I did not like that the breakaways not reimbursed since I paid for a room with breakfast and they are not serving breakfast.  The charge for parking and I was not aware of this extra charge.  There is a 300 deposit I still need to get from them.,0
The restaurant and bar is only open 3 days| so you have to leave the property to get anything| which can get hard with 3 kids. Parking fee is a little ridiculous.,1
Charges for everything. Daily parking| multiple taxes| charge for wifi. Receptionist was not friendly offered the family in line in front of me complementary bottles of water but when I asked the following day all of a sudden there's a charge?! Never will I stay here again.,0
The hotel has a gym| pool| and a gift shop with basic necessities! The staff are accommodating after checking in late. And only minutes away from Disneyland. What more can you ask for‚Ä¶,1
Great hotel for the price.  Friendly staff| clean room and walking distance to restaurants and Disney.,1
Second stay here| perfect if your spending your days at the parks.,1
Really friendly staff| comfy rooms.,1
One star. I wish our stay was better. The staff is very friendly. Be warned of a few things: buffet breakfast included is a lie. We paid extra for this| and there is no buffet open currently not for another few weeks. There is no mention of some hidden hotel resort additional charge $29 almost $30 bucks. Plus small print does say $24 parking but it's another hidden charge. Not sure why it mentions ‚Äúeasy parking‚Äù but doesn't mention the $24 cost up front| only in fine print. It's a new hotel so it looks nice but don't be fooled| I did not sleep at all. Kept waking up all night even 1am and 3 am because you can hear every little thing from all rooms around and hall ways. Even walking from above you hear it. People's TVs turned on you hear it clearly. People talking| you hear it clearly. Worse night sleep in a hote I've had. The staff is friendly and the rooms are pristine cleaned is the only plus.,0
Super friendly at the front desk| and the room was way bigger than expected.,1
"The hotel overall was pretty good| however the beds were hard as a rock| and the bathroom fan in my room didn't work. The telephone was spotty(loose rj11 connector on the wire). There was also one odd happening| had room service just come into our room about an hour or two after we checked in around 5pm with pizza boxes in hand. My wife and I looked at her and said| ""Excuse me?"" She left. We called the front desk and a supervisor| I assume came up to the room with new room keys| which not sure why it would make any bit of difference when housekeeping has a universal keycard| and told us the housekeeper thought the room was dirty and needed cleaning| which doesn't make much sense as to why she would come into a room with pizza| even if it was an empty box why come into a room with more trash? So| not that it's really a big issue or make me not want to consider staying here again| I thought it was noteworthy of mentioning. Overall though it was a good stay| wish Disney was doing their Fireworks| since we did pay extra for the Fireworks View room.",1
It was a perfect distance away from Disneyland and a nice comfortable stay,1
Recently new property. Nice set up.  Pool really large and kept at nice temperature.Was right near freeway so all the South facing rooms likely have the noise that we had and view of a vacant lot.Staff friendly and helpful.Was surprised by 2 items - 1| parking is an add on charge and not part of the room price and 2| Hilton does not give Honors points if you book via the agencies.,1
The hotel honored my booking which allowed us to check out 2 hours late.  Due to unusual circumstances they even extended that so we could check out 3 hours late.  They honored our booking benefits and gave us a $50 credit towards Disney gifts at the book shop.  The hotel has a nice pool and the facilities are clean.  The room was very spacious and clean.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.,1
We have stayed at this hotel multiple times and referred many friends and family. When we got to the hotel we were notified that they are no longer doing breakfast. I wish we were told prior so we can make arrangements. We got into our room and it seemed pretty clean| however it looked as if they missed vacuuming we had old cheese on the desk chair and some other debris including cotton with possible earwax or something on the ground and a used mask behind the toilet. We called the front desk they offered to switch our room but we just had unpacked everything. We asked if they can come and vacuum they said they would after two days of no one coming we asked again and they finally came and vacuumed. They didn't offer to comp anything| but upon our Checkout I asked and with no question they comped our parking. We did love that the spa was open until 12am| so after a full day in the park we can go relax our bodies in the spa. Overall it's a good hotel and this is the first time we really had any issues and we have been coming here for 5 plus years.,1
Love the pool and jacuzzi. Beautiful lobby with great decor. Great beds. I enjoy staying here and it is close to Disneyland. I miss the breakfast and free parking. $24 per night for parking is too expensive. Would love it if they added a universal machine in the gym.,1
Great hotel. Great room. Close to Disneyland.,1
Very close to Disneyland. Staff here was not helpful at all. Wouldn't stay here again.,0
We had a great stay. Our room was clean. The facility was tidy. And the staff was amazing!!!,1
Everything has been great so far.,1
Great hotel and location!  I searched around for a while to find the best place to stay for our Disney trip. I had a hotel right across the street from the park booked| but received a notification that they don't allow parking before check in or after check out‚Ä¶so I cancelled it and found this hotel. I'm glad I did!  This hotel is CLOSE!  Only a 5-7 minute walk with kiddos. The staff is friendly. It's very clean. Wonderful overall. There is plenty of parking which is $25 per day| but it's well worth it. You'll pay that at Disney| have to shuttle in| AND I heard that just to park at Disney takes about an hour. No thanks!  Definitely will be staying here again. Oh yeah| great pool and they even have a free laundry facility with nice machines.,1
Hate that there was a $28 parking fee. Didn't get notice of that on expedia. Thanks!!!! But it had a great pool and nice big rooms. Staff was very nice,1
The hotel was Awesome and the room was Amazing. The view from the room wasn't the greatest but the room had everything you needed| mini frig.| microwave| comfortable bed| spacious bathroom and outlets everywhere. it made it so easy to charge your phone or any other electrical device you have. Every staff member was very friendly and courteous at the hotel. It had a great beach theme and walking distance to many restaurants and Disneyland.,1
Very clean,1
Nice and spacious room. Everything was sparkling clean. Would recommend to provide complimentary bottle of water.,1
I really like the hotel| nice area and nice room,1
Stayed for 2 nights and the price was so worth it. It's clean. Everything seems to be sanitized and cleaned very well. Close to Disneyland. Would stay there again.,1
Didnt like that i had to pay for parking,1
Beautiful hotel| friendly staff| quick check in| definitely recommend. It is close to everything!,1
Very close Disneyland| within walking distance| and really quiet. Not really convenient to restaurants| and parking at $25.00 per day was a little too much.,1
Good location for Disneyland. Was able to walk there and back. The room was comfortable. Felt safe.,1
Very nice hotel| friendly staff|  sweet pool and jacuzzi. The rooms were nice and clean| loved the colors and room setup. We were very happy here. Only thing| is parking you have to pay which was a bummer.,1
I liked the decor and the cleanliness very well taken care of and the staff was very helpful| didn't get to enjoy the amenities due to COVID restrictions freeway entrance is convenient parking is plenty | its a 10 minute walk to Disney | overall it was a great stay with no complaints for my one night,1
Clean and cool.,1
Super clean. Staff very nice and helpful. We loved the pool area. Will definitely look into staying here again. Also love the vintage VW bus parked in the pool area. Nice touch.üòÅ,1
My stay was relaxing. The staff was very accommodating too. The front staff person| Joey was very friendly and made us all feel so welcomed. I've stayed at this hotel and quite enjoy my time here. It was not crowded at all and all Covid guidelines are being followed.The only con was that the pool was not heated. Other than that| everything was great. Also| I was interested in a late check out. I called the front desk the next morning and David| the General Manager took great care of me. I recommend this place for Friends| couples and families.,1
I love how comfy the beds and pillows feel. Every time I stay there it is always clean and smells good!,1
The bed and pillows were excellent!! I slept better than I have been sleeping lately. I was looking to the Breakfast Buffet| which wasn't operating due to Ccovid-19. That would have been something I would like to have seen when I was making the reservation.,1
Very nice swimming pool and clean facility.,1
The pool is open till 12:00 midnight is along with the jacuzzi but I'm parking is $24 ridiculous,1
Really nice| staff is awesome.,1
Staff super friendly! Pool is heated nice big and clean open from 6am-12am,1
Beautiful Hotel surrounded by a lot of great restaurants and shopping centers. Beautiful pool area| spacious rooms| friendly staff.,1
More than what I expected| the room was big| clean| comfortable and had a very modern vibe in regards to the decor.  Would highly recommend and plan on coming back.,1
Friendly staff| very clean| multiple towels and hand rags. Lots of soap and cups. Very great service.,1
will definitely recommend and will definitely come back in the near future!,1
Everything was great but the water in the jacuzzi and the shower/ tub never got hot?,1
Parking was almost $30.00 with taxes| for one night is kind of ridiculous. However| the location and hotel itself was very nice.,1
Very nice hotel and staff. I will definitely stay here again.,1
There was absolutely no parking available. When we checked in| we notified the people at the front desk| and that resulted in them having to give up their own spots due to the lack of parking spaces available. Then to add to it| they had no more rooms with king beds available| which is what we really wanted. I still took the room with 2 queen beds only because I wouldn't have been able to get a refund. I was ready to ask for a refund when we realized there was a lack of parking! Oh well. Definitely not going to stay here again| that's for sure. The room| however| was nice enough.,0
So arriving at the hotel| the front desk seemed a little weird. We asked him about the pool and he made it clear that it should only be us no outsiders. Which were just like ok? Because it really was my daughter and her father and I. So he gave us our room key and when we arrived to our room| he had given us a dirty room| the door was open and there was trash holding the door open (pizza boxes| empty soda bottles) so we assumed you'd sleeping hadn't cleaned it yet. We went back down and he gave us another room. After that the room itself is amazing clean extremely spacious !! And the best part is the Pool!! It's beautiful especially at night. The hallways were extremely muggy and gross and the front desk guy kept staring at us like if we were doing something bad which we weren't| but other than that my daughter LOVED the pool and it was well worth it. Ps it does suck that they force you to pay for parking 26$ extremely expensive. They're lucky the pool makes up for it other than that it wouldn't be worth it.,1
It was great! Needed an escape from the smoke and thought a pool would be great! Front desk easy| and super polite. Pool was socially distant and towels were always stocked.,1
Amazing stay with my cousin that was visiting from a Arizona| only complaint their was not cold water and the shower was hotter than ouch! Other than that I would come again.,1
Very happy with my stay.  It was an easy walk to the parks.  My room was large and quiet.  Comfortable bed after a long day.,1
Very clean| great hot tub however the pool could have been heated.,1
Great value for the area and an easy walk to the parks! Every staff member we encountered was helpful and friendly and the room was very clean and comfortable enough. The fire alarm did randomly go off one morning in our room| but the staff was prompt with getting it silenced and fixing the issue for the remainder of the trip. We will definitely consider this property for future trips!,1
Very modern and stylish. We were missing a nightstand which seemed strange| but beside that clean| close to lots of attractions| and great service.,1
The room was nice & clean. Disneyland was about a mile away so walking after the park closed isn't fun. It's an extra $20 per night just to park| no good,1
The property was new and clean. It was also very conveniently located near disneyland. We were able to walk there and back with ease!,1
Loved the property| except for parking.  Had to park at far end of lot near construction.  Hidden parking fee of $24 per night!,1
Clean rooms very convenient location to Disneyland. A few of the staff members were rude and the breakfast was not included as was originally advertised. Had to pay almost $5 per person but they didnt tell you this untill checkout and it wasnt worth the $5 even for the quality.,0
Quiet despite being right next to the freewayComfortable bedsFriendly staff,1
The property was super clean| great location| and amazing staff.,1
I liked how close to Disneyland it was and the room was big.,1
It had a very good location. You can easily walk to Disneyland. You can also easily walk to an entertainment area that has shops and restaurants.,1
Booked Sun Coast because we were attending a show at the House of Blues. Location was absolutely perfect| it was less than a 10 minute walk right around the corner from the hotel. Check in was very easy| plenty of parking also a small underground parking lot. Took me maybe five minutes to check in. As for parking - I knew there was a fee| but didn't think there would be tax too so total for one night was 19  dollars. Staff was very friendly and the hotel itself was very clean. The room was very nice and spacious. the king bed was sooo comfortable! The cabinet to the mini fridge was falling off but it worked so we didn't care. Bathroom was clean and the room had a nice big tv. No complaints. Saw the pool from a distance looked very nice| didn't use it though. Would definitely book here again! Also| we were on the 3rd floor facing the freeway and didn't hear a single car!,1
We've stayed at this hotel several times when it was Country Inn and loved it. It was close to Disneyland and the price was right. Parking was great and free (or included in the price). Since taken over by Hilton| prices doubled and now we had to pay for parking. Shame on me for not reading the fine print. The hotel staff did not  mention the parking fee when they handed me the card to put in the window. Unfortunately there was someone above us that was very noisy and seemed to be baving a football game in the room. We will be looking for our next favorite hotel now.,0
It was a great stay very close to Disneyland about 10 minute walk,1
The property was a short walk to Disneyland. The outdoor pool was nice. The Hostess for breakfast was rude.,1
The hotel is clean and sharp. Staff is great! Within walking distance to Disneyland.,1
Had a king room on 1st floor which made getting in/out very easy. Room was super comfortable and QUIET (especially for being adjacent to the freeway and on 1st floor). Breakfast was pretty basic for hot food (coffee| juice| eggs| bacon| sausage & waffles) but for the roughly $9 that they charge| you won't find a better price for a sit-down breakfast.,1
Walking distance to Disneyland and newly updated.,1
It was a 2 day reservation but after the first night some how the house keeping department was told we should be checking out.  And even though there was a do not disturb sign on the door the knocked and tried to open the door twice before 10 am.  Then at 11:30 the Maintenance department came and unlocked the door and barged right int on the two of us.  Argued with me that we should be leaving.  That check out was at 11:00.  I told him that we had two night reservation.  He said he would go check again but that we should be out before he comes back.  I called the front desk and she confirmed that we had a two night reservation and none of that should have happened.  She was nice enough to  give me a $30 credit.  We later left the room for dinner and when we came back we were locked out of our room.  That sent me over the edge.  I asked to talk to a manager... there was non working on that Saturday night.   expected to hear from a manager before we left Sunday.  I heard anything from anyone.,0
Really super hotel as a base for our family Disney Land trip.Easy walk to The Park| friendly staff and good breakfast as well. Highly recommended,1
the Location of the property was good.  Our room was extremely large.  It needed more lighting.  There was no couch in the room just empty floor space.  Overall| we had excellent service throughout our 9 day stay.,1
I liked that everything looked brand new.The only thing that I didn't like was that the bathroom towels had hairs on them and they were supposed to be clean. It made me think that maybe they just folded the dirty towels and place them back on the bathroom shelves.,1
Great customer service. Very happy with our room.,1
The hotel was nice overall and close walking distance to Disney and Anaheim Gardenwalk. The only thing I did not like about our room was the sliding bathroom door it didn't lock and you could see in the bathroom.,1
The hotel is very nice and the size of the rooms are perfect for our family. The breakfast buffet was perfect| only downside is you have to pay| it's not included.,1
We stayed 4 nights because we could find nothing else after night one.  The traffic from Interstate 5 is so loud.  They have me earplugs but hard to sleep since I don't use them at home.  The night before we went to bar for drink but bartender knew nothing about the beer on tap.  Another hitch washing free breakfast.  It was marketed as such but they said the policy changed and that was ridiculous.   So no it should not be rated as high.   The traffic alone was so loud all hours,0
Everything was clean and service was excellent by housekeeping| and front desk. All the staff were very helpful. Gave us information about near by places and booked LA tour for us.,1
The hotel is 15 minutes walking distance to Disneyland. Our room was studio type| very clean| and really big for 4 adults| 1 king size bed and double sofa bed. The bed was comfortable. The hotel was newly refurbished with new carpet and nice furnitures. It is now under Hilton. The WiFi was good. The aircon was quiet and efficient. The bathroom was big with strong hot shower. Although it was near the highway it was quiet. At the end of the corridor| you can see the Ferris wheel of the Disney Adventure Park. We didn't have the time to use the pool and the gym. Ellie at the reception was friendly and efficient in managing our concerns| like defective faucet in the bathroom sink and provided us toiletries when I asked since only 1 set was given for 4 of us. Take note that there is parking fee to pay now. There is shuttle to Disneyland if you would like to use it for a fee per person per day. Overall| I highly recommend this hotel. We booked it last minute for a very reasonable price during the busiest time of Christmas.,1
Very good location| quiet and convenient. Rooms are up-to-date and very clean. Maid service each day keeps things clean and neat.,1
Heated pool| late night bar| continental breakfast| plenty of parking and ART bus stop front of the facility. Convenience and centralized to access freeway| easy walk to Disneyland| etc,1
Great location| good rooms and amenities| friendly staff and nice (paid) breakfast,1
Friendly staffs and good location although our room was quite noisy due to other rude guests.,1
Mish the front desk woman was amazing! The staff was quick to change rooms since the AC was out in our original room. Great experience,1
Great walking distance to Disney| car rental| restaurants| great for family and enjoy this being a Hilton brand| I'll definitively come back.,1
This property has recently been renovated and the service is excellent. I found everything I needed there and if I had a question that was answered quickly. I was very surprised because I was exhausted tonight I got there and the maintenance man even went above and beyond and went and picked up my mail for me at the bar. I would stay here in a heartbeat,1
The continital breakfast area could of been bigger. There is a lot of families all trying to eat at the same time.,1
Hotel was clean and comfortable. Large beautiful pool and hot tub.  Includes Breakfast was great| lots of options. Staff was very friendly!  About 7 blocks from Disney parks| free bus comes every 20-30 mins too which was nice!,1
This was a perfect location to walk to the parks| and the complimentary breakfast had robust and delicious options to please just about anyone. Parking was also complimentary. All around| this was an excellent option if you don't want to pay the premium to stay on-site. Additionally| aside from the Grand California| this hotel is probably a shorter walk to the park entrances.,1
Everything was very nice| a shuttle to disneyland would have been very convenient,1
It was an interesting stay at the property. I was smacked in the middle of the switch. So it was a little confusing what was going on. I wish they had a way of contacting me letting me know the switch was going to occur prior to us coming. Every night we had to get new card keys because of the transition. Which was slightly annoying. But the breakfast was still the same and tasty. Customer service was still nice. Maria was a friendly face at breakfast. The theming is the new resort is so weird because it's not near Huntington Beach| or any water for that matter. But I'll embrace the new change. I just hope breakfast and parking is included in the price after this change!,1
The property| staff| and amenities are excellent. We were able to check in early| which was super convenient with having a toddler and going to Disney. The complimentary buffet breakfast had all of the essentials: cereal| oatmeal| waffles| toast| eggs| sausage| fruit| yogurt| juices| coffee| & tea. The only small downside is that breakfast ends pretty early at 9:30am. The entire hotel including the room were upgraded and clean. Parking was free and lot was large. The main reason we booked here was the close walking proximity to Disneyland| which was a less than a fifteen minute walk. I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend to anyone considering a hotel near Disney or in the Anaheim area. House of blues and many other eateries are right across the street. The convenience store at the hotel has items in case you forget toiletries or want a snack. Also| Mish the front desk manager was excellent and friendly both during check in and check out. She mentioned they are transitioning to a Hilton at this time.A  for this establishment.,1
The property was undergoing renovation at the time of our visit| but it was not very distracting. The staff were fantastic| we were very happy.,1
Hotel is undergoing some remodeling and it is coming out very nice. Food available at the hot breakfast was great and a good start to the day.,1
Wonderful| friendly hotel in a great location. Rooms were very clean. Will definitely be back.,1
Good for families. Close to Disneyland. Good buffet breakfast,1
location is near from disney land.(if u plan to visit DL it will be superb )the hotel is so spacious and clean.i loved the pillows...indeed‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°so comfy!!stayed only for 1 night but was fabulous!!highly recommended^^,1
This was a great place to stay. Everything was clean and new and the staff was so friendly we almost stayed at the hotel for the day instead of going to Disneyland.,1
Staff was very friendly. Room comfortable. Breakfast yummy but not very hot.,1
Free parking| free breakfast| amazing breakfast| nice| new| modern| clean. Walking distance to Disneyland.,1
There was road construction going on next to the hotel| so getting TO and INTO the hotel was challenging and very frustrating as there was no signage to direct us nor was there any notification from the hotel to alert us prior to checking in. Once inside the hotel| we were pleasantly surprised by how nice it was. The room itself was really nice| spacious & super clean| but the noise level from the freeway made it an uncomfortable and restless night. I really do believe that the rooms facing the freeway should have better noise insulation. The breakfast was okay and with the exception of scrambled eggs and yogurt| offered the usual carb and sugar laden items most children crave. The breakfast area was kept clean and the staff was very nice. The proximity to Disneyland and not paying Disneyland hotel prices was the reason for choosing this hotel and we would stay here again for that reason| but would request a room away from the freeway. We walked to and from Disneyland and loved that we didn't have to pay extra for parking!,1
"This is a clean and recently updated hotel. The hot breakfast was great with a variety for picky eaters and the dining staff was very pleasant. The theme park shuttle was convenient| but it is also close enough to walk. My only complaint would be that they advertised (and I booked) a room with 2 QUEEN sized beds. They were more the size of DOUBLE beds. Upon check out| when I was asked how my stay was| I mentioned this to the gal and expressed how disappointing this was since we did not get the rest we needed having 2 adults in such a small bed. She responded that they are not the ""California Queen"" beds that I may be used to| but that they are a ""Standard Queen"" that most hotels have. I travel seven months out of the year| and have NEVER heard of such a thing. This left a bad taste in my mouth for an otherwise nice stay.",1
great hotel with great location,1
Good breakfast to fuel up for Disney or whatever the days adventures. Friendly and helpful staff. Rooms are decent sized. Walking distance to Disney.,1
The staff was friendly and attentive. The room was very clean and nicely decorated. The pool was great for the kids and the breakfast was good| but not great. I would stay here again for our next Disneyland vacation.,1
The room was huge and very clean.  There was a microwave| mini fridge and coffeemaker.  It was a short walk to Disney but we used Lufthansa| because after walking all day that short walk was not fun.  The hotel doesn't offer a shuttle but there is one you can buy tickets for that stops at the hotel.  The breakfast was fantastic lots of choices| cereal| oatmeal| waffles| eggs| sausage| biscuits and gravel| etc.,1
We had to stay in a different (backup) hotel they had for us on our first night because of a plumbing issue| but that was free so we were okay with it. They were very accommodating and kind. The hotel had electric charging lots for us to charge our Tesla| the room they upgraded us to because of the plumbing thing was very nice| the breakfast was awesome| the pool is nice and the staff are great. 15 minutes to walk to Disneyland,1
Our family stay at the Country inn & Suites was very enjoyable. A 15 minute walk to the Parks made it easy to return during the day and rest. The breakfast was excellent and plentiful. Play room next to the breakfast area is a great idea for the kids! Free parking| breakfast| and WiFi made it the best choice for our family.,1
Friendly staff and a great continental breakfast! Pool and bar hours were awesome,1
Great breakfast| short walk to Disneyland-friendly staff and clean facility,1
Very nice hotel| super clean and near new. Great pool for after Disney relax. Staff were terrific| short walk to Disney or Angels stadium. Definitely would stay here again.,1
Top property that's super modern and is basically a new property so feels clean and fresh and is only 10-15 min walk to Disneyland with a cheap $7 taxi ride home if your feeling tied :) highly recommended,1
When I booked this hotel I never thought I would be saying this but my stay here was nothing but disappointment. Staff ignored my request for a specific room upon check in. Hotel was undergoing construction that was never mentioned. Noise started before 8am so it was impossible to rest. Room was on the side of freeway and was very noisy also. Would not recommend this hotel and will never stay here again.,0
It was close enough to Disneyland that we could easily walk to the park but also had transit available. The rooms were very comfortable and spacious. The Bistro did not provide room service and unfortunately we had to wait about 50 mins for the only person working to return from break so we could order a meal. Then we had to return later to pick it up.Bre Evans at the front desk was super helpful and friendly and made our  stay pleasant from the onset!,1
"Disappointing.   Upon check in the sliding barn door for the bathroom was broken.  Screws were missing form the top. The door would barely budge.  We booked this room because they listed cribs in their description.  We asked for a crib| a pack n play showed up. Which our 1 year old can't sleep in.  After a very long night of no sleep| I checked with the front desk again| they said they would send crib. After 2 pm I checked again| which they said they can't give me one.   On leaving to the park on the second day I took our do not disturb off.  Seeing the cleaning lady in the hallway and hearing her ask another guest if she would like service I assumed she was going to clean our room.  As she was directly across the hallway.   We came back 6 hours and it wasn't cleaned. Leaving dirty dishes| diapers and trash in our room all day made for a smelly return.  I went back to desk again and asked for service.  2 hours went by|  I took all the dishes out myself| ran into front desk in the hallway with hand full of dishes and they just kept walking..   At this point expecting another sleepless night we decided to go back home.  When I approached the front again I said we wanted to check out.  She asked about our stay and I said it was TERRIBLE|  she looked at my account and said oh you prepaid.  I guess that's it.   After having so many problems and not once did they say ""sorry"" I felt disgusted about my families experience staying here.  My recourse is to leave this response..",0
Had a great stay here. Everyone we encountered was amazing but especially Hallie at the front desk. She made check-in and check-out easy and was amazing to work with.,1
The property is beautiful. I have loved coming here for more than 20 years. Comfy bed!!!,1
Loved the pool!!! My only complaint is the beds were to hard for my comfort. Besides that| the staff was exceptional| the property was immaculate| there was a great grab and go store. Loved that the safe was larger than the customary hotel safe!  Would definitely recommend this resort although I'm not sure if I'd stay here again because of the hard beds. That's probably a personal preference,1
Great location for a family trip to Disneyland!  Highly recommend!,1
Love this property always stays here when I go to LA,1
Updated hotel. Clean bathroom| clean bed sheets.  Liked the little store they had downstairs very convenient.  Breakfast ended at 10:30 which was very convenient.  Staff is super friendly and they try to provide recommendations of things/stuff to do.,1
Well managed hotel. Looked new. Very clean. The sofa bed was terrible though. Had backaches after sleeping on it for 2 nights. The breakfast was average with limited selection.,1
Excellent staff and amenities!  There wasn't one request that was denied.  Highly recommend!,1
Great location! Very close to disneyland and feels like home!,1
This hotel was clean| staff was extremely nice and welcoming.  Breakfast was good. Homeade cookies in the lobby is a nice touch. The saltwater infinity pool was amazing. The ART bus stops right in front of the hotel and runs every 30 min. I will definitely be staying here again!,1
Great hotel. Clean nice large rooms. Friendly staff. Big pool hot breakfast. Would recommend and would stay again,1
Awesome hotel| incredibly kind staff!! The king suite was soo spacious and perfect for our family of 4. The only things we did not like were how hard the beds are| the bathroom not having an actual locking door or air vent| no air circulation within the room. Otherwise the whole over all stay was the best| I believe they're  remodeling their already modern hotel so can only imagine how much more incredible it'll be :),1
Newer| very clean| awesome staff & very helpful! Not a bad walk to Disneyland and lots of places to eat near by.,1
Clean| centrally located and modern. A great option for families going to Disneyland. Highly recommended!,1
Best hotel ever! Pool beautiful and is open for when you get back from disney till late and uou can watch the fireworks at Disney. We are at the bar and it was lovely food| well presented and lots of it. The room was always cleaned promptly and one day we got back and they had wrapped towels to make a bed for my sons teddies and did some other clever things to make it special. Free laundry and dryer ( just buy powder and conditioner from onsite shop only ¬£4. Great way to ensd holiday..100 recomend and will return!,1
Newer remodelled hotel| with large rooms and great breakfast. The kids enjoyed the pool.  I loved the walkability to Disneyland!  About 10-15 mins got us to the Disneyland gates| no bus to wait for or parking lot to deal with.,1
The hotel location is great! The staff is super friendly. And love the free parking and the free hot breakfast  place. This is simple what we need before the Disneyland,1
Staff| rooms and the pool were great! We had a nice stay.,1
We enjoyed our stay at this hotel| and would definitely stay here again and refer our friends & family here. The property is modern| clean and family-friendly. The staff was great| and each staff member we engaged with throughout our stay was friendly| helpful and service-oriented. Great pool and amenities| and we enjoyed the complimentary breakfast each morning| in addition to fresh baked cookies in the lobby. Although the location is close enough to walk to the Disneyland| we elected to use the shuttle which was super convenient with a little one. Layout of lobby entrance| dining area and hotel room is modern and spacious. Great place to stay while visiting Disneyland!,1
Very Clean and excellent customer service Breakfast is perfect,1
An absolute fantastic hotel. Great big rooms| huge breakfast| awesome pool and the staff were amazing!!!! Highly recommend!,1
Excellent location| great amenities| complimentary breakfast was delicious and staff greeted ya at the entrance every time we came back.,1
Great staff! Great location! Great price!!!It was so convenient in getting to Disneyland and easy access to the freeway. The staff were so courteous| welcoming| and helpful. It's in a safe area and the Garden Walk with restaurants| entertainment| and shops is also just a quick walk to get to. Love that it has free parking| free freshly cooked breakfast (not the packaged stuff...) and a pool| gym| and laundry facility! The rooms are big and it's very family oriented! I thoroughly enjoyed my vacation thanks to this hotel!!,1
the pool was great| good maid service. dont like the limited parking.,1
Clean| great free breakfast| didn't have the smoke smell. It was a great stay. The only thing was the pool it had too much Clorox.,1
Perfect stopover for few days on our family toad trip.,1
Great stay! Clean| modern & room was amazing.  Customer service was on point,1
Location| cleanliness| and extremely friendly staff made this trip top notch!  Easy walk to Disney!  Highly recommended.  Will be my new Disney hotel location.,1
Fabulous. The staff are helpful| courteous and friendly and really care that you have a wonderful stay. The hotel is clean|  bright| with spacious rooms and breakfast is provided. Great location for the Parks and would not hesitate to return.,1
Nice rooms| customer service was fantastic. The complimentary breakfast was awesome,1
Breakfast| convenience| pool hours| fireworks view| etc.,1
Very accommodating and friendly staff at front desk. Room exceptionally clean and very spacious. Good locatuon| safe| quiet| and walking distance to Disneyland (10-15 minutes depending on your pace). Would stay again without hesitation!,1
Great location short walk to Disneyland. The room was great| comfortable| and clean. Staff were very friendly and great costumer service.,1
I liked everything very clean and the staff was amazing,1
We were happy. Better than expected.....Oren,1
Amazing hotel ! Great pool clean rooms and a 5 min walk to Disney so perfectly located.  A shopping mall is 5mins away also with lots of dining options.Would stay again !!!,1
Pool and hot tub were really nice| the proximity to Disneyland (only a fifteen minute walk) was also great. Staff were consistently friendly and helpful.,1
Clean| modern good pool and location. Hearty breakfast and big roon,1
Let down by not cleaning room on one day! Was mentioned to the manager.,1
Great stay! Loved the free breakfast and parking and very close to Disney.  Only downside was a little noisy when we were trying to sleep being so close to busy highway.,1
Really liked the staff and facilities. Hotel is in a great location and kids enjoyed watching the Disneyland fireworks from the pool!,1
Great stay away from the Disney busyness. Super clean hotel and pool and quiet even though it's close to the highway. Pool was big and perfect for kids. Couldn't beat the free breakfast before the 10 minute walk to Disney!,1
Nice location convenient to Disney. Nice pool| free breakfast and free parking.,1
Clean quiet hotel that's close to Disneyland with a great pool for the kids.,1
This hotel room is huge and clean! We really loved it. The front manager is really helpful. easy to walk to Disneyland maybe 10 minutes. But you want to get on the bus the way come back in the dark. Hotel has a shuttle every 20-30 min with $ 4 adult one day pass. Oh  Landry room is at basement which is nice too! Breakfast is nice as well. We will be back to this hotel!,1
Hotel location is near to Disneyland| hotel staff| facilities services are good.,1
Liked: The property common areas are very clean and inviting. Gym was small but had good equipment options.Disliked: The shower head was covered in calcium so the water barely came out. It got worse when someone else turned on their shower.,1
All of the staff were very pleasant and accommodating. The pool and jacuzzi was clean| not overcrowded and the jacuzzi was actually hot. It was wonderful. Most impressive was the ability of the staff to maintain an outstanding well stocked breakfast buffet with good food quality for the number of guest coming through a 31/2 hour timeframe. You couldn't ask for more for an all inclusive complimentary buffet. I will definitely return on my next visit to Disneyland.,1
My stay at Country Inn Anaheim was amazing! Bre and Mish helped me and now remember on the Japanese Panda!,1
Good and clean hotel with affordable price the breakfast was not the best but for the price it was good,1
Loved the property| super clean| nice staff| walking distance to disney,1
Pool area is great though they need to limit people bringing their own sound system.  That same group got a little out of hand.  The room is extraordinary| huge! Stroll to Disneyland.  We went to American Sports Center| a short 13 min walk.  Close to all.  Would definitely come again.  Check in was a bit of a challenge when people are buying Disney passes.  There is not a dedicated front desk person so you have to wait and the group before us had an excessive amount of questions.,1
Great from location| breakfast| cleanliness,1
They could do with more than 10 pool recliners considering the size of the complex. Also they leave you cardboard cups no glasses for use in the room. Not environmentally friendly or nice to use. Adequate breakfast and only a 10 min walk to Disneyland. We didn't hear the motorway which was great.,1
Cleanness| easy checking/out| room size| free breakfast| free parking,1
It was fine.  Pool was nice and close to Disney park. .,1
everything was great keep the good prices| good staff | we will be back,1
The staff was incredibly friendly.  The facilities were clean| and the location was an easy walk to Disneyland.  The kids loved the pool.  The food was good| and free guest parking was a plus.  We plan to stay at this hotel again on our next trip to Disneyland.  A+++++++,1
"Only complaints are: our room AC made quite loud whirling sound & the ""kids room"" was just 4 oversize pillows & a TV| that was disappointing since our grandchildren were not going Disneyland that left little to do for them.",1
Breakfast was awesome.staff was friendly. Pool was great.really enjoyed staying there,1
Everyone is amazing .. you could open the restaurant/bar a little earlier perhaps for lunch.,1
very serious traffic noise at night| I could not deep sleep.,0
The  staff was very friendly and helpful.  The room was convenient and served us well.  Breakfast was good.  Our only problem was they had the wrong room for us at check in  but they remedied it quickly.  I would stay there again.,1
The location was perfect.  Walking distance to Disneyland| easy access to highway| 20 minute drive to beaches.  Wonderful staff and great hot breakfast,1
Pool was amazing| great free breakfast. Bar for drinks. Free cookies at front desk. Clean rooms| friendly staff.,1
Everything was great except not enough towels or pillows for a family of 4.,1
We had a spacious room| kids where able to play and run around. Walking distance to disneyland and restaurants. Good breakfast buffet. Pleasant staff.,1
Great friendly staff and walking distance to Disney land,1
The pool stays open till midnight. That is awesome!!!! There's literally nothing i didn't like about this place,1
Great stay overall| but would not recommend the sofa bed for adults. VERY uncomfortable!  Also| was surprised there wasn't an exhaust fan in the bathroom.  Staff was very nice and accommodating. Breakfast was excellent| and the staff weighed very hard to replenish the food and clean tables.  10- 15 minute walk to Disneyland.,1
Really good breakfast included and the property has a nice pool as well,1
My stay was absolutely amazing and the room was very spacious. Normally I look for hotels that offer free breakfast and this is one hotel that I highly recommend if you're traveling with children. The location is great and our room facing the Disneyland fire works made our vacation much more enjoyable. Thanks for the great customer service Country Inn!,1
Super friendly staff. Short walk to Disney- far enough to get a break from the noise.Perfect hotel!,1
Spacious room. Friendly staff. Good breakfast.  The chef accommodated gluten allergy. Facilities were clean and seemed new.,1
Although I had pre-paid| they did not save my room So when I got there at 11pm and tired from driving 7 hours| I had to be sent to their 'sister' hotel. It was a nice stay but didn't have the Continental breakfast I needed for my busy morning. Manager offered for me to come back for it but no one's got time for that! They know how to take the reservation| but they don't know how to HOLD the reservation - Jerry Seinfeld,0
There was NOTHING not to like. We were extremely happy with it all.,1
Location is great. Breakfast was great. Rooms are clean. They can improve a little on furnishings but the king size bedroom served us well for a group of four. Overall a great stay,1
Wonderful stay. Close to Disney. Great breakfast. Lobby pretty. Nice pool. Courteous staff.,1
Always clean and beds are comfortable. Parking may be tough sometimes. We usually get the last few spots| especially when we come home late from Disneylnd.,1
My stay was absolutely AMAZING and the hotel staff made sure we were comfortable and happy at all times. They need to fire the housekeeping staff.,1
Place has gone downhill in last year since previous stay.  Hairs and stains on towels and sheets.  Left over hard bits of food on silverware in buffet.,0
We enjoyed our 6 nights in the hotel. It's very new and fresh. We only had breakfast 2-3 mornings & found it to be average. The nice part is there's plenty of seating. The pool and hot tub were well kept. You can see DL fireworks from the pool| but not the hot tub. We ordered pizza from the Bistro one night and it was good| just wish it was open before 5:00. Market had good options for munchies. Parking spaces are in short supply| but we always managed to find the last spot. Based on the number of times we shared the elevator with employees| I'd guess there's no service elevator or employee parking. Prior to our stay| I remember reading a review calling the rooms ‚Äúspacious|‚Äù but I don't agree. They were nice| clean| and beds were comfy. It was great having a fridge| microwave| and coffee maker in the room. The one thing they were desperately missing is towel racks or hooks to put towels on. We had to get creative and hang towels over the hard furniture. We left around 1:00 pm one day and never got a cleaning so we definitely had to figure out how to dry all of the towels. The area is super close to DL| but we chose to drive each day to avoid the end-of-night exhaustion. It's across the street from the Garden Walk| which is kind of a downtown Disney knockoff. The one thing I hated was the freeway noise while trying to sleep| especially because I'd asked for a quiet room. We couldn't hear other guests though!,1
This place has the biggest pool at a hotel that I have seen in the LA-Long Beach-Anaheim area. One end is fairly shallow| so if you are swimming laps at 6:00am (yes| the pool is open then)| you may have to swim on your back at that end. May not be able to swim laps at other times of the day. The rooms and bed are nice and comfortable. Shower was fine. Breakfast has both a 4-small waffle maker and a 1-large waffle maker. They seem to alternate between sausage and bacon. The had hash browns like diced potatoes| and like McD's. Wasn't keen on the canned fruit for yogurt. The desk has cookies. You can watch the Disney fireworks at night from the end of the hallways. The food from the bar area is pretty good| too.,1
Super Convenient to Disney. We walked there. Nice rooms| nice breakfast. The onsite Bistro was perfect for easy food and a glass of wine.,1
Clean and new; breakfast; swimming pool; staff; parking,1
We loved this hotel. We will return for sure. The hotel is really clean and relaxing. It's family friendly and the staff was really supportive and nice.,1
Property is new.I did not like the freeway noise that I could hear at night.I did not like the location of my suite facing the freeway.,1
I cancel my reservation in a different hotel because I read great reviews about this hotel and I don't regretted at all. This hotel is very close to Disneyland (about 15 min walking with kids)| rooms are huge and everything looks new| free breakfast with a lot of options| the coffee is great!!! And they have free cookies| a variety of teas and hot chocolate also for free after 3pm. You can relax in the swimming and jacuzzi which open until 12am. Or you can just watch the fireworks from there every night at 9.30pm. We stay 7 days and we really had great experience. I don't think you can get free parking| free breakfast| free WiFi in any other brand knew hotel for the same price. Price is great for all you can get here. They have a bar with a kids corner so you can drink and have fun while your kids are watching a movie next to you. They also have a restaurant but they close at 10pm. I just tried the pesto chicken pizza and my kids love it. My only suggestion is to put locks in the bathrooms| usually I hide from my kids there :) but bathrooms have only a slide door without locks and everytime I was using the bathroom kids open the door. Special shoutout for Maria| last day at the hotel I woke up late and missed the breakfast| Maria was so nice and made me a coffee since I can't start my day without coffee. You made my day Maria!!! I highly recommend this hotel!!! And for sure I'll be back soon.,1
Would not hesitate to book again,1
The room set up was great-separate sleeping & living areas. Also| the staff was super attentive. Finally| the pool & hot tub are opened from 6am - midnight...that was nice!,1
Beautiful| clean rooms. Close distance to the park. Great breakfast spread and you can watch fireworks by the pool. Will definitely be back!,1
It was walking distance from Disney What I didn't like was the pressure in the shower,1
Walking distance to Disney and food places. Free parking,1
Our favorite hotel when we visit Disneyland! Free parking and breakfast is a huge plus.,1
Good location| plenty parking| can see the disney fireworks,1
Was great!  Beds are not the best but location was great for the price. Pool was really nice.,1
Housekeeping staff was amazing. As well as front desk personnel. Breakfast could have more variety but all in all| an excellent experience. Would come back or recommend without hesitation.,1
Great stay| comfortable beds| delicious/vast breakfast| 15 minute walk to Disney! Would stay again!,1
Great location to walk to Disney!,1
This hotel is awesome| super close to Disney but more than that super good service all the employees were super friendly and helpful. Loved the experience üòç,1
Excellent hotel extremely clean & comfortable ...¬†Would definetely recommend this hotel to everybody!,1
Ever staff member greeted us as we passed them in the halls! It was such a positive environment. The room was very clean and the breakfast was really good!,1
I was very happy with everything and would stay her again. Great staff,1
Clean and close to Disney!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
Very pleased staying at Country Inn! Very friendly staff| every morning fresh hot continental breakfast| clean and comfortable room. Able to do laundry free downstairs and location is close to alot of places.,1
Great breakfast| free parking| near Disneyland. Clean rooms,1
Nina at check in was outstanding!!! I must say| I'm one of those crazy ‚Äúgermaphobes‚Äù if you will and this hotel definitely made the cut! I was so surprised at how clean the beds were... they even have bed bug protectors on their mattresses! Enough about that... breakfast was a great start with healthy options and a great start to our day! I was able to drink my wine and also take some to the room without having to find a convenience store!The walk to Disney is about 10 minutes and super convenient! Overall| I'm a pretty tough critic and this place has a great staff| it's classy and affordable! Do yourself a favor and stay here!,1
I love that is very cleanAlso the breakfast is deliciousCustomer service is amazing,1
Free parking and free warm breakfast! Yes there is a resort fee but the two freebies cost more then the fee! Great room!,1
Great hotel and very friendly staff! They accommodated me when I asked for early check in and my room preferences. Very large and clean rooms with new contemporary decor. Very short walk to Disneyland and we would definitely stay here.,1
New hotel| so it's very nice and clean. Rooms are spacious. Pool was nice and big and temperature was quite warm. Good selection at breakfast| and we did utilize the bar a couple of evenings while the kids swam or watched a movie in the movie room next door. Only issue we had was the (free) washing machine stopped working in the middle of a load which was kind of an inconvenience.Very walkable to Disneyland (about 10 min)| or there is a shuttle that comes by every 20 minutes.  Lots of restaurant selection very close by also.  Would definitely recommend this hotel.,1
Loved the swimming pool. Close to Disneyland.  Staff was very helpful and pleasant.,1
Very close to Disneyland. Staff was very welcoming and polite and answered every question we had. Would definitely stay here again,1
Close by restraurants and close to Disney. This property was very clean an dstaff was excellent,1
Very close to Disneyland and a very nice hotel.  Staff are friendly and accommodating,1
Clean| friendly staff helpful at check-in| great breakfast options,1
This location is a stone throw away from Disney Land. More than once we just watched the fireworks from our hallway window. The facilities are new and clean| absolutely worth it. Only things I wish would improve:- Hot tub jets are nearly useless in pressure.- Shower water pressure was absolutely terrible. It has been by far the worst shower experience I've had.,1
everything about this hotel is outstanding! great breakfast rooms were clean you can walk to Disney or they have a shuttle.outstanding staff.,1
It was a great stay for our family vacation to Disneyland. It's walking distance to the park| the breakfast was amazing and the staff were so friendly and welcoming. The hotel is top notch for cleanliness. A great stay. Would recommend to anyone travelling to Disneyland.,1
I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights with my 2 kids as we were visiting Disneyland. What we really liked: very clean premises| modern style| friendly staff| very comfortable king bed (the sofa bed didn't look as comfortable but my kid still slept like a log in it)| spacious and quiet room (all rooms may not be as quiet as some may be facing the highway)| free breakfast with plenty of options and pleasant dining room| free parking right in front of hotel (not in a remote lot| you can access your car at all times without asking a valet)| nice swimming pool (half of it is shallow enough for a 5 year old to walk so non swimmers can still have plenty of fun| water was clean and warm)| perfect location (13 minute walk to Disney security gate at a 5 year old pace| including 2 light crossings!)| convenient bistro in the evening offering pizzas to the kids' delight and with friendly server who poured me a very generous glass of wine :-) The only thing I would improve: add racks and hooks to hang towels in the bathroom! Our room only had 1 hook and it was above the bathtub... So we ended up drying our towels on the chairs and housekeeping replaced them every day| which was a waste. Overall| this is our fourth Disney trip| we booked different hotels on each trip and this is my favorite so far!,1
Hotel was nicely done and location is 10-15 min walk to Disneyland.  Pool area & Lobby also really nice.  Breakfast was decent. Would definitely stay again.,1
Easy walking distance to Disney.  Also the breakfast was very good,1
Great pool. Loved the variety for breakfast in the am. Cookies at night are a nice touch. 10min walk to Disney| or can take the Art shuttle bus.,1
Every time we go to Disneyland we stay here. The hotel has a great location| rooms are clean and spacious. The staff is WONDERFUL| and their breakfast buffet has a lot of variety.,1
Great people and a brilliant hotel! Would come back again in the future! Staff were very helpful,1
Room| breakfast and amenities were all excellent. Great location| walking distance from Disneyland.,1
Very friendly staff| great breakfast| clean| nice pool and easy walking to Disney,1
Great property! Loved our stay it was clean and new with good food st the bar.The breakfast had good options but unfortunately I quickly learned the eggs didn't sit well with my tummy! But there was many more options. The pool was nice and refreshing after a day of Disney! Highly recommend watching the fireworks from there!They let us have a later check out which was lovely as their was ability to do this that day. We just had to call down that morning to make sure it was okay. The accessibility to the parks was good not across the street about a 1km walk to and from the park or a bus ride.Great stay,1
Check in was super easy and fast| they let us check in at 1 instead of the check in time at 3. We got the king suite it was super spacious and loved having the couch that turned into a bed for the kids. The pool was heated so it was nice when it was a windy day. And the free breakfast was amazing! They had so many choices to choose from. They keep it super clean! Disneyland was super close they do have a shuttle service provided by the city you just have to pay a small amount to use it| they give you all that info at the desk. You could also walk their| we just drove it was no more than a 5 min drive. I would definitely stay here again it was close enough to Disney but not so close that it was crowded with a bunch of people.,1
I like everything. The room was clean and large| swimming pool is good.,1
Property is very nice and clean. Great breakfast and no problems walking to Disney. Pool is nice and the staff was great. Nina was a big help for us on this trip.,1
Very nice stay. Great location.,1
I   liked everything about this hotel and so did the other 11 people I   travelled with. Walking distance to Disney and some great restaurants. (Cheesecake Factory and PF Changs) Swimming pool and jacuzzi open until midnight. Complimentary cookies| coffee and tea in the lobby area in the evening. Free washer and dryers bring your own soap or buy it in the gift shop. Great variety of fruit and food to eat in their complimentary breakfast. Very friendly and helpful staff and clean and comfortable rooms. You can see the fireworks from outside their hotel| inside at the large windows at the end of the hallways or inside the pool!,1
AMAZING experience from check in to checkout! Great location| great service a short walk to Garden Walk restaurants and Disneyland| honestly cannot say enough good things about this hotel! We will be back üòä,1
This hotel is only a 14 minute walk to Disneyland. Along the way| there are many other great restaurants which makes it very convenient for kids. Breakfast selection was great! Staff was amazingly friendly and accommodating. The hotel was very open| modern and clean. The pool hours were great; and even better that you can see fireworks on the pool deck. I would recommend this for any family travelling to Disney.,1
Staff is very friendly. Entire hotel very clean! They also allowed my family to come spend time with me at the swimming pool.,1
Our family of four stayed here for our trip to Disneyland (5 nights) over spring break.  All staff was always friendly and more than willing to accommodate.  From front desk to maids/maintenance| all were friendly.Rooms were very spacious| clean and up to date.  Little to no noise from hallways/neighboring rooms as well.  Beds were comfy.  Bathroom was large.Free breakfast was key for the trip.  Plenty of options (also 3 waffle makers).  Didn't make it to lobby bar| but looked fully stocked with the essentials and a happy hour.Pool and hot tub were amazing.  Both very big and pool was heated.  During our afternoon breaks from Disney| often had entire pool to ourselves.About 10 minute walk to front gates at Disneyland.  We also elected to get a bus pass for the ART (Anaheim Resorts Transportation) which comes into parking lot.  Simple 5-10 minute ride which was nice when we were already walking 8-10 miles a day in the parks with young kids.Would definitely stay here again if in the area.,1
Great location for Disneyland| 10 minute walk.  Hotel has 2 chargers using the SemaConnect but one is in a handicapped spot?....the other is accessible via 2 stalls which is nice.   Charging is free but slow.  Pool is heated and the restaurant has good eats and drinks.  Room cleaning was just ok.,1
10-15 minute walk to Disneyland.  Quiet building| clean room| friendly staff.  I wish we had known we were getting an ADA room prior to our visit.  Because it was an ADA room water got on a good portion of the bathroom floor and I had to wipe floor every time we took a shower.  Other than that it is a great place to stay and would do so again.,1
Clean comfortable bed. Courteous staff food was good an breakfast was good.,1
Walking distance to Disneyland and free breakfast and laundry.,1
We stayed here to go to Disneyland. It was a very nice hotel. My kids loved playing in the pool. Breakfast wasn't too bad,1
Clean| safe| and very attentive staff. Nice breakfast buffet.,1
Super cleaned! Close to Disneyland. Excellent service!,1
The bartender Joshua was amazing.  It was late| we were hungry so he went to the kitchen and put together an amazing Hummus platter.,1
The hotel was clean and quit and the room had plenty of space for our family of four. I was disappointed in the breakfast| but it was as expected from a free hotel breakfast.,1
Great location that was close to Disney. Wonderful breakfast and pool area.,1
Good location that is close to airport and beaches.,1
The friendliest desk clerk welcomed us| answered my LAX questions| chatted about colleges with me| and promised fresh cookies soon.  After we settled in for the night| we were treated to Disney fireworks from the window at our third floor hallway.  Although our room was close to the road| we heard none of the traffic.  I am a light sleeper and was thrilled with our stay.  Kudos to the staff!,1
Comfortable accommodations within walking distance to Magic Kingdom and other malls.,1
Everything was wonderful. Beautiful| gracious staff. Clean rooms and common area. Continue with the great work! I'll definitely come back when visiting this area.,1
My only complaint was the eggs for the breakfast and there was no bacon. Haha! Other than that the hotel staff was amazing. Our room was just as clean when we checked in as it was when we came back from a long day at Disneyland. We loved the fact that we were able to catch the ART bus right in front of the hotel. When we travel again we will definitely look for another Country Inn.,1
It was close to Disneyland. It had a pretty good variety for breakfast as well. The only thing that was frustrating was the water pressure. I have thick hair and it was very hard to take a shower when the water wasn't coming out with any pressure.,1
Staff were great....allowed us to leave our baggage before we checked in....great pool and yummy breakfast- yummy....great hotel.,1
The hotel was very nice| room and very clean.   I really appreciated how well the room was cleaned....not just a hurried job but really cleaned very  well.  Staff was very friendly and helpful,1
The Place is very Neat | The Breakfast is ok | friendly staff and parking is free | walking distance to Disney,1
So many nice reviews and they didnt disappoint.  We showed up before check-in and were able to get a room| the breakfast was nice and they kept stocking it. At somepoint a transient got in the building  attempted to go into the breakfast area and security/management came out of nowhere and removed him quick without a commotion in less than a minute| out of the 40 people there I think only 5 of us noticed what transpired. Will definitely stay there again,1
Perfect place to stay when visiting Disneyland. Disney is a short easy walk. We walked late at night with no problems. Yummy breakfast with lots of choices. The room was updated and they did a really good job. We live local but wanted to stay close to Disneyland. We were pleased with our choice. And the pool looks great even though we didn't use it.,1
We arrived for check in and everything went really smooth and fast. They explained everything to us quick and thorough.   The rooms were specious and clean. Bkfst buffet clean and the food was delicious(variety).  The ENTIRE staff were very friendly and helpful. Walking distance to Disneyland. We walked to park and back both days.,1
We had a perfect stay at the country inn!! They allowed us to check in early because there was a room available. They brought a crib up to the room right away| at no charge. So nice! The breakfast was delicious. Loved the brownie brittle in the gift shop. :),1
I love the property. It was clean and the staff was very friendly,1
The complimentary breakfast was a big plus for our stay. The room & staff are amazing!,1
This hotel is awesome for family's| great breakfast| rooms are nice size plus very clean..10 min walk to disney so didnt have to pay for disney parking which is ridiculous..overall would recommend to my family n friends..,1
Good hotel| free breakfast was very nice with a good selection. 10-15 minute walk to Disney which is shorter than waiting in the bus queues.,1
Good location| pool| big rooms| kids had fun. Breakfast was ok,1
Liked when we walked in and gas log fire was on .Front desk were friendly and had fixed up my booking,1
I booked this property based on reviews of other customers and we were not disappointed. The room was new| clean and quiet.  The walk from our room to the Disneyland gates was right at 15 minutes.   As others have stated| the free breakfast is second to none. I was astonished| hot eggs| bacon| sausage| fresh fruit| biscuits and gravy| granola and yogurt| cottage cheese| and a waffle station and more.  I would not hesitate to stay here again .,1
Excellent customer service!  PERFECT location for Disneyland.  Hot| fresh breakfast buffet... WINS ALL AROUND!,1
If I had to pick a ‚Äúnegative‚Äù... and this is a stretch... the cookies that are ‚Äúavailable‚Äù in the lobby 24/7 seemed to run out very quickly and a few times the younger ones were a little disappointed that there were none.,1
I really like this hotel. You can use Disney land shuttle  bus if you pay $5 (1day pass). Also hotel has a swimming pool. I like this hotel's lobby. If I come disney land one more time| I will stay here. I ate hotel restaurant pizza| it was good üòÑüòÑüòÑ.,1
Great hotel within walking distance to Disneyland. Great breakfast! Very clean rooms.,1
A nice hotel within walking distance to Disney. Our stay was great| we would for sure go back.,1
We took a Lyft ride to Disneyland in the morning| but were fine walking back at the end of the day.,1
really close to Disney land| had a great breakfast.,1
We had a disneyland trip planned and this location was great! Very nice hotel.,1
Wonderful stay at this hotel,1
Cons: close to I-5 so a bit of noise from the freeway comes through but it's not bad it just adds a bit of white noise. While this can be seen as a con| it can also be seen as a pro as it has very quick access to the freeway if you need it (which I did for my business trip). Also the breakfast was not very good; runny/soggy liquid eggs| soggy sausages| greasy bacon| the only items I ended up eating were the waffles (fresh self-serve waffle maker) and yogurt but there are other items like cereal| toast| other baked goods and juice.,1
Staff was friendly. Hotel was very nice and clean. Block away from Disneyland,1
The hotel staff was friendly and helpful and the room was large and comfortable. The breakfast was delicious and there was plenty of seating throughout the dining and bar areas.,1
Staff was great!,1
Overall great stay.,1
I do feel this is a better option than some of the older hotels in the area and much better value than the Disney hotels. Uber trips to Disneyland can be had for $6-8 plus tips| and arrive at the hotel within minutes of booking| so for a few more dollars| it is worth the additional cost.,1
Great property. Clean| modern looking. Free breakfast was good. They said it would be a 15 minute walk to Disney front gate. I would say it was closer to a ten minute walk. Only negative is that you can hear traffic on I-5| but that's typical for all the hotels in the area.,1
Great hotel - clean| comfortable| really quiet (I was worried being right by the freeway| but it was surprisingly soundproof and we were just 2 rooms in from the freeway)| nice hot breakfast| good size pool| 15-20-min walk for family from hotel to Disney gates.,1
Great Breakfast.  Friendly Bistro on site. Very convenient for you if you don't feel like going out for dinner after a busy day at Disneyland. Nice and relaxing too.,1
The staff was  great. We felt like they were our friends. I observed Them being kind and patient with other people no matter how difficul the situation.,1
Wonderful| clean centrally located hotel with good food and excellent service.  Had a terrific stay!,1
Friendly staff clean room close to Disneyland which was very handy,1
Very clean. Great idea to have a kids room. Very comfortable and inviting lobby with various seating areas.,1
Nice| contemporary| clean. Comfortable rooms| friendly staff. Great location for both Convention Center and Disneyland. Only negative is the evening restaurant experience| but that can be avoided by going to one of the restaurants on nearby Katella for example.,1
I love how clean and how everything seems to be fairly new.,1
Really enjoyed this hotel. Lovely great rooms| will stay again!!,1
Our second stay here! Clean room| beautiful hotel. All our requests were met. Recommend for families that want to stay off of the busy streets| with an easy traffic free walk to Disneyland! Free breakfast and parking- worth the $17 resort fee!,1
We loved this hotel for going to Disneyland. It was only a 15 min walk to the park. Our room was nice and spacious| very clean| staff were friendly and breakfast was good. I would definitely stay here again.,1
Friendly staff. Property is really close to Disneyland. Room was very comfortable and clean.,1
Lovely pool area and breakfast area.,1
It was a great place to stay; staff is friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good.  Walking distance to the entrance of Disneyland made it very convenient.,1
We liked the big low sinks| the breakfast| the comfy beds and the pool and hottub were a good size.  We liked the fireplace and the lobby area.,1
The hotel was higly rated according to trip advisor and lived up to its expectations,1
Everything was great except the mattress was hard.,1
It was a great experience. Check in was a breeze. Room was super clean and very nice. We enjoyed the view from the 4th floor. Staff was very helpful. Any question we had they were all answered.,1
Big space for a family of three and the breakfast was plentiful and had options for everyone.,1
Very realized to come to this hotel after a poor experience at a neighboring hotel.,1
Walking distance to Disneyland and can you buy tickets at hotel to avoid queues.,1
Really nice hotel for what you pay - staff nice| breakfasts are good and great location for Disneyland with it being a max 10-15min walk to the parks and a great view from our room of the fireworks!,1
Big windows at the end of the hallways| you can see the fireworks from Disneyland. Nice heated pool and great continental breakfast!,1
Close to Disneyland. Good breakfast,1
Great location. Very clean and friendly staff. Good breakfast. I'd return with my family without a doubt.,1
Great hotel. Highly recommend. Staff were friendly and helpful. Easy walk to Disneyland and restaurants.,1
Service was great. Everyone from front desk to breakfast area servers were helpful. It's a close walk to the Garden walk and Disneyland. We will be staying here again. It's clean and the breakfast was amazing. It was an amazing deal for the price.,1
Within walking distance to Disneyland and shopping| near the freeway but couldn't hear it. Nice breakfast and free parking.,1
Love this hotel. Always have the best experience,1
We loved our stay here! The hotel is a newer hotel and you can tell once you enter the lobby. The staff was very friendly. The rooms were clean and spacious. I was concerned about noise because it was by the freeway| but we heard absolutely nothing. The breakfast was great!! Many options for everyone. Although they do not have a shuttle to the park| its only about a 10 minute walk. We loved our stay here! will definitely be back!,1
I asked the staffs why room 541 is easy to hear the noise from the pool and the front desk guy in the morning told me his first words are| you are the first to complain!  Is it how the expensive charge hotel cost me over $1|000 for 4 nights to give me that kind the answer?I didn't stay at 1-2 stars hotel rating did I?  So I'm not allowed to say what is not going well for me.  I said it after I checked out meaning I paid all the price already so what lame do the staffs have to face up with the customer!,1
The hotel was GREAT! it was very clean and comfortable. Breakfast was delicious ! close to Disneyland,1
The location to Disneyland was great| a comfortable walk to the park.,1
Had a great stay| really enjoyed Joey and Tabby. They made our stay really enjoyable.,1
Love the Country Inn and Suites! Great service| very friendly staff| spacious rooms| really good continental breakfast! Also a great Bistro and Bar.,1
Amazing and awesome!,1
Limited parking was the only problem.  Had to park far from  The hotel and it's cameras and signs telling me owner is responsible for car and items inside.,1
Love the hotel! This is our third time staying| but we were put on the 5th floor this time around and for whatever reason the beds were uncomfortably hard| the water pressure wasn't good| and the water took a long time to get warm. Not like the other visits we've had here. üòî,1
"Very nice| even thought the weather was cool.""................................",1
Weekend trip to DL with kids. Room was a suite with 1 king and full sleeper sofa. Bed was comfortable| but sleeper sofa was horrible. Mattress was very thin with spring poking and noisy if you moved at all. If I knew that before hand would have hot 2 queens to be more comfortable. Room was clean and spacious with a nice size fridge & microwave. Was able to grab mac n cheese and drinks in small shop on main floor. Did not get breakfast do it it being crowded both mornings at 7 am. Walk to park is 15-20 minutes but after a long day| we took bus back. You have to wait 20 minutes| but our feet didn't care they weren't walking another step. Staff was friendly and was easy to get towels| etc when needed. Noise level was not over whelming except when complete silent in room. You then could hear EVERYTHING from rooms above and next door. Parking was easy and plenty of spaces. They charge a resort fee which is not included in your payments to Hotels.com. The food places are all on Harbor so if you will need to eat on way in or out of DL or grab a snack in shop downstairs. One thing that bothered us and almost ruined our day at DL is the power saving. If you plug your phone in on a wall controlled by power saving outlet it WILL NOT charge. Made that mistake first night and luckily my daughter's phone did charge and we could use for DL app and tickets. Overall nice| clean hotel but I would say we won't stay again for DL trip| maybe a trip for a game at ball field.,1
I asked the reception staff to bring up a bag of presents I had for my daughter after we got to our room so that it appeared Santa had brought them to her. Not only did they oblige they added an adorable Mickey and card from Santa!! Above and beyond!!,1
It was clean and well prepared during Christmas season however seats are limited during breakfast. Location are within walking distance 10 mins from Disneyland gate. CVS| 711| some food chains like chinese food| pizza and subway chains are within 7 mins walk.,1
Comfort| location. Kid friendly.,1
The property was nicely decorated and very clean.And everyone was very nice and helpful.Would definitely stay here again.,1
Hotel was good. Great location to disney. Uber was about 5 bucks but you can definately walk.  Eggs could have been cooked a little longer though. Bed was not comfy| felt like sleeping on cement. Roman is a great bartender!,1
Staff are very friendly and approachable. The establishment is walking distance from Disneyland. My son and I are very pleased with our stay and will be coming back whenever we are in town again.,1
Free ev charging for our plug-in hybrid. So all our in town driving was essentially free. Free laundry service on site and a great little convenience shop.,1
Great location for Disney| just a 10 minute walk. ART shuttle stops directly in front of property. Rooms were spacious and clean. The free breakfast was great| waffles were delicious. Will definitely stay here again.,1
This property is quite new and within easy and safe walking distance of Disneyland. It also has (paid) bus service to and from the park. The suites are spacious and good for families. The water pressure in the bathroom is lacking a bit and| despite the encouragement to reuse towels| there are no towel bars available to dry things in the bathroom. The daily breakfast is really lovely. We had variation for the first two days and then a very similar spread for the latter four days. The pool is very nice and has long hours. The service staff addressed some deficiencies in our room quickly (e.g.| dirty towels when we arrived and fridge not working). The staff were also very friendly. We would likely stay here again. The value for the price is very good.,1
Great stay. Frequent shuttle to get to Disneyland was available for low cost or we were also able to take a quick 10 minute walk. Great breakfast with lots of healthy options! Hotel was roomy and staff friendly and helpful. Definitely stay again!,1
Easy to walk to Disneyland| clean| comfortable| decent breakfast.,1
Staff was very very friendly and helpful.  Check in and check out was smooth.,1
Hotel was a five minute walk to Disneyland. We got a very private room (top floor in the corner suite) minimizing the noise from little ones. Breakfast was great and hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. We will be coming back here on our next Disney vacation!,1
I rarely like to stay a hotel twice but I'm really starting to only want to stay here for future trips because I don't have to worry at all about anything going wrong when we stay here. We love he breakfast| free parking| pool| and service. The girls love the movie room and I love having the gym accessible. Definitely one of my favorite hotels ever!,1
It was ok the room was not as big as expected the breakfast not as good I usually stay at Embassy Suite but want to give this a try| and the deposited was too much | hotel fee charged already even though not check in yet and once check in charge deposit fee $100 and when check out still don't get the deposit back yet don't know how long will they reimburse it| first try n last,0
Very close to Disneyland| only a 15 minute walk. Lots of nearby restaurants and shopping options. Lots of parking spaces available. The complementary breakfast has very limited selections| could use more items to choose from.,1
The room was clean and spacious. Breakfast was good.  Easy access to disneyland.,1
Great location for Disneyland! The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was clean. The breakfast was big with a lot of good variety of options.,1
10 minute walk to DisneylandStaff was very kind and helpfulBreakfast OKRooms great,1
The hotel was clean and service was great.  It is within walking distance to all the Disney attractions. I highly recommend the hotel!,1
The hotel was new and beautiful. The staff was very friendly| the breakfast was good| everything smelled fresh. The pool area was nice. The complimentary laundry was nice| the bar and staff was nice| happy to have late nice dinner option| little store was useful and nice| warm cookies in the evening. Walking distance to Disneyland resort. Just overall wonderful. Will definitely stay here again.,1
Excellent hotel. Staff more than helpful and were happy to provide the little things. Large rooms that were super comfortable. An excellent buffet breakfast too!,1
The whole staff was so friendly. They have excellent customer service all around from the front desk| cleaning staff and even the guys who works the continental breakfast lobby. It's really nice and clean. The king size suite we had was nice and spacious. Our kids loved the sofa bed and loved that they had their own tv too. The breakfast in the morning was actually pretty good. A lot better then all the other continental breakfast. They actually had hot food like eggs| sausage| bacon and potatoes. Along with the usual waffles| toast| English muffins| oatmeal| cereal| fruit| yogurt| and different juices. They even had free cookies at the check in counter. And always had a selection of coffee| tea and hot coco in the lobby. The salt water heated pool was a plus for my boys. The fact that they got to swim at night after we got back from the park made them excited. It was a really big pool| heated and it opened til midnight. Overall I would highly recommend this place to others who don't mind walking 10-12 mins or ride the ART to the park. I will definitely be back...,1
Didn't like the traffic noise from freeway other than that was a great stay.,1
Great breakfast. Spacious room and very friendly staff.,1
Hotel is on the newer side. Very nice. Rooms are comfortable| beds are a little hard. The morning buffet is nice. Food is fine.  Yes| you can walk to Disneyland. It's about fifteen minutes. But we Ubered for $8.OO. There's a city shuttle that comes on the hotel grounds too. Cost is about the same for three people.,1
It is a nice hotel| clean| big rooms| nice breakfast. 15mins walk to Disneyland. My daughter was so happy to arrive at the hotel. I wish we had spent some time at the pool too.,1
The hotel is walking distance to Disneyland| the hotel staff is always helpful| clean pool and spa. They have free breakfast which is great. They do have a $17 resort fee per day that you learn about at check out.,1
It is great hotel. Clean and new. Good breakfast with many choices,1
We loved our stay.  Staff was so friendly. Definitely would stay againüòä,1
You can see Disneyland Park Fireworks on the pool bar late night. Very good location to Disneyland and shuttle is available.,1
Very nice and clean hotel with great amenities. Close walking distance to Disney.,1
It was a perfect room for the four of us....spacious| very clean| comfy mattresses and nice bedding. The hotel accommodated our request to have a view of the Disneyland fireworks and the shuttle bus to and from Disneyland picked us up right in the hotel parking lot and returned us to the same spot. It was very convenient...much better than the parking and tram situation at Disneyland! We will definitely stay here again. Thank you Hotels.com,1
Clean| comfortable| close to Disneyland.,1
A great choice for visiting Disneyland.  You can walk to the parks in about 10 mins or take a bus that drops off/picks up in the hotel parking lot. Bus passes available to purchase at the hotel desk. Complementary tea| coffee| and hot chocolate all day was a nice bonus.  Parking| WiFi| and breakfast are all included. Breakfast is quite basic| but good enough to get something before you are off and running.  Food menu in the bar was limited| but did the trick when we took a brief break from the parks to eat and change to warmer clothes for the evening.   We didn't use the pool| but were surprised how large and nice it was.  Staff was friendly and helpful and the room was a decent size| modern| and clean. We would absolutely stay here again when visiting Disney.,1
Everything was great. We went to Disneyland waking! The breakfast has a lot of things to eat.,1
Clean| new hotel | very close to Disneyland.  In addition| the free parking was great too.,1
Great pool |fantastic included breakfast |highly recommended,1
Great hotel| great service.,1
We had a good time at Disneyland.  CLEAN| good breakfast| nice people.   Not a fan of the card for lights key. Like new property. walk to Disneyland.,1
Our room was clean and relatively quiet. Noise from neighbors was minimal| though freeway traffic nearby provided white noise at night. Bath amenities were on the skimpy side| considering the price of the room. Only one set of shampoo/conditioner for a two-night stay for three people. Guest bar soaps were tiny and towels were small and scratchy. Overall| it was decent enough for our needs. Complimentary breakfast was good. No room service. Just glad it was clean.,1
The hotel was amazing. Everything is always great at the hotel only minor setback would be the parking and the staff. Staff seems a little ‚Äúoccupied‚Äù with other things than attend to the guests needs. I waited at the counter for about 10 minutes before they helped me while they were seemingly putting stuff away. Not cool. But other than that the hotel is always great,1
Very clean and quiet. Pool is great. Breakfast area was crowded. Staff was very friendly and helpful.,1
Staff was friendly| it was very clean| and the pool/hot tub were fabulous.,1
The room itself was very good. Spacious| with a bar fridge and microwave.  We were very happy with our stay.,1
Hotel amenities are great and this is now our go-to Disneyland hotel. Loved the free parking and breakfast. Only downside was that the beds weren't super comfortable.,1
Good breakfast.  Clean and short walk to Disney.,1
"Our first time to disneyland and we wanted a nice hotel that wouldnt break our budget| we were not disappointed. First of all the location is great. 3 blocks away from the front gate of disney. House of blues a block away| delicious pizza at ""the pizza press"" 2 blocks down. The breakfast buffet was the best I've ever had at a hotel...waffles|sausage|bacon|eggs|hashbrowns etc. The pool and hot tub are open till midnight and there is a nice little bar downstairs as well. We will not hesitate to stay here again. Loved it!",1
Polite staff. Clean room. Walking distance to Disneyland. Good value. Would stay again,1
Nice hotel  Close to Disney and house of blues.also right off the freeway,1
Amazing experience of fun for our family of 8.  Wonderful hot breakfast| staff so courteous and conscientious to make guests have luxury.  Quick to help| quick to clean up a breakfast table| friendly housekeepers.  We highly recommend this stay.  You truly CAN walk to Disneyland with little ones from here! (.5 mile)  Did not expect such a wonderful experience this close to the theme park. Nice color scheme| quiet at night| efficient large hot breakfast room. Oh and the pool is amazing too.  Kids had such fun as did adults.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND it.,1
Great location| easy access to Disneyland. Plenty of free parking. The stay was great. Definitely would stay there again.,1
Very clean| friendly staff service. Breakfast was not so good.,1
The area was great close proximity to Disneyland. The only issue was the shower the knob to pull up was stuck and we could not shower. While having breakfast Federico the chief engineer asked how was the room and we informed of shower situation when we got back to room it was fixed. Too late for our stay but great customer service,1
Great Hotel!  Great Location!! Close to Disney and Restaurants,1
Our stay was excellent. Read the reviews and decided to try this hotel. We will be staying here for future Disneyland trips. It's a short 2 blocks away. The hotel itself it very modern and new. My kids 1 and 3 loved the pool which is only a couple feet deep. The morning breakfast is also very good w everything you'd want to start your long day at Disneyland. Our room was very spacious amd the bed was very comfy.,1
The staff was outstanding!,1
Hot breakfast buffet is a bonus. You can make mini waffles| and toast| and each morning had eggs| fruit| and a meat (bacon one day| sausage another)| along with a selection of cereals| hot oatmeal| and hashbrowns/tater tots. If you're there for Disney| then having a big breakfast like this is a GREAT way to start off your day and keep you full. Disney eats are expensive. The hot tub was also just very warm| though I suspect that it has to do with the blistering heat of the day (but the nights were cool). Good| friendly service. No complaints there. Shuttle comes to the hotel| but it is every 1/2 hour.,1
All in all| with a family of four| this was a great stay. If it was an adult trip| i would choose another hotel with a little more amenities.,1
My family and I love the Country Inn and Suites. Mish and house keeping are amazing. We asked for extra towels and the crib for my 1-year old and not only they came| but they set it up and added a hypoallergenic sheet. Only criticism was when we checked out my son needed his diaper changed and only the women's restroom had the changing pad. The men's restroom should have one to| but nonetheless this won't deter us from staying there again.,1
Walking distance to Disneyland| clean| great breakfast.,1
Everything was very new| clean and updated.  The free breakfast made the day much easier.,1
Wveryone was very nice. The property clean and beautiful!,1
The property was nice| clean and well kept.  The room was odd in that it had a sleeper sofa and desk in the front of the space| bathroom and king bed and huge empty space in the back of the room.  It was nice to have the sofa for our kids separated by the bathroom.  The room was laid out strangely.  We did have some issues with house keeping not cleaning the room but they fixed it and gave us some credit for the mistake.  Overall a great experience.,1
A wonderful place to stay| fun pool| clean rooms| friendly staff & yummy breakfasts. Walking distance to Disney & Convenient to freeways. We plan to return here.,1
Good relaxing safe base from which to enjoy Disneyland and surroundings,1
Nice new hotel but poor breakfast selection,1
Very clean and convenient location.  Breakfast was good too.,1
We have a great time. Close to Disney. Close to restaurants. Great pool. Clean. Nice staff. Rooms clean.,1
Me and my family (1 baby girl + 1 toddler) had a great time at the hotel. Specially because it's at walking distance of Disneyland. Also have to mention a plus for spacious room (bedroom plus living room with sofa-bed) made it comfortable to accomodate our needs.,1
Super friendly staff| amazing breakfast| room was beautiful| clean and very cozy. staff helped with every question i had. location is great if going to Disneyland-about 5 min walk. 100% will stay here again,1
very accommodating to our needs.  Fresh cookies| swimming pool and spa very nice and it's open late.  The only bad thing I have to say is they were out of shower caps.  It would be great if they had the in the room,1
It was great|  very close from Disneyland which work perfect for us| very clean| employees were very nice| breakfast was great| they had plenty selection| I love our room but my son loved the outside pool| thank you for everything|  we will decently come back.,1
AC was a bit noisy. Mattresses aren't the best| but not a deal breaker. 5 minute stroll to Gardenwalk and Cheescake Factory.,1
Very nice new hotel in walking distance from Disneyland. Perfect for our family we were traveling with a 2month old. The only bad thing I can say is that our shower was hard to use. It was stuck in the tub mode and my husband was able to use dental floss to finally fix it. Don't stay in room 204 you will have difficulty using the shower. The breakfast was amazing and the staff was very friendly. Will definitely be staying there again.,1
We were able to get early check-in and even though our room was next to the elevators we didn't hear them. The only thing I'd say we don't enjoy is the food at happy hour.,1
Dec√≤r is a little old looking but rooms spacious and clean. Comfortable beds| WiFi has been patchy though. Other than that everything else is fine. 20min Uber to Universal & Warner Bros which was perfect.,1
All things considered though| we will definitely consider staying here again if the price is right!,1
Pool is big and great| fitness center ok and they also have complimentary laundry room!,1
This Hotel is in a perfect location for visiting Disneyland.,1
Great location from Disneyland and very reasonable price. Rooms are very spacious| up to date| and very clean. Must stay if you are going to be visiting for a couple of days.,1
Super friendly staff!!! Overall| a great experience!,1
My family has stayed in this hotel many times in the last few years since it opened.  Our experience is always positive with the staff.  The facility is very close to Disneyland which is very convenient.  Breakfast is average with little variety| it is satisfactory in filling the belly before a day at Disneyland.  Only negative comments I can say about the property is that the bathrooms were not quite as clean this trip as compared to previous stays and the beds are very hard.  The pool is amazing and it is a very quiet place to get your rest.  I really hope they address the uncomfortable beds before our next stay and other than that we cannot wait to return.,1
We loved our stay during our family trip to Disneyland. It was wonderful to come back after a exhausting day and relax at the bar while our kids swam in the pool. We ordered dinner from the bar a few of the nights and it was surprisingly delicious. It was so nice to not have to drove anywhere and fight any more crowds for dinner| we could eat and head straight up to bed. The breakfast was pretty good and they had plenty of space for all the kids and parents to get their food and not feel like we were climbing over each other. The beds were to hard for me and not very comfortable but that is my only complaint. We were able to relax on the beanbags and wait for our delayed plane in their cute little kids room located close to the bar. It really was a great hotel and a quick walk to Disneyland I would recommend it to any one looking for a close hotel to Disneyland.,1
Overall| we really enjoyed this hotel! The people were friendly (even when we checked in late)| breakfast was included| and their little market was open when we got back late from the parks. The parking was a little limited| many people were using the parking lot for the hotel next door that is currently under construction. I can imagine parking will be more difficult when that is complete. Otherwise| great stay!,1
We were able to get an early check in and the process was quick. It was an easy walk to Disneyland and at the end of the day it was nice to discover that the pool stayed open late| allowed for a good wind down.,1
Very nice hotel for the price.  Friendly people and a good breakfast.,1
Great stay| I highly recommend this hotel to any family that will be visiting Disneyland. Clean| great service and great breakfast.,1
I'll start by saying I love country inn and will continue to stay (this location included) but there were a few issues with our room. When we first got there| our lock didn't work| which is just personal preference. The chair had a couple stains on it| and the bed was rock hard. You could hear the busy highway outside crystal clear (as well as the construction. The pros| this place is very clean| has free breakfast| and is walking distance to Disneyland. The staff is also very friendly and try to help any way possible. I would stay here again| although it will not be my first choice,1
Very friendly and helpful staff| answered all of our questions and easily purchased Disney tickets which was extremely convenient.,1
This hotel is a gem. Clean| fresh rooms. Great breakfast. Swimming pool and spa open until midnight. We parked our car each day with ease. Sure there is a whirl of traffic in the am but it didn't bother us. We have always stayed across the street from dl in those busy| tired hotels. Never again.,1
Great location| clean| helpful staff| great breakfast. Would stay here again!,1
Really close to Disney. Really helpful and kind staff (receptionist| waiters|cooks| cleaning crews). Stayed for five days and each day there was a slight variety in breakfast. Have stayed at many hotels in Anaheim before and I can say I will definitely book this hotel again for my next Disney trip.,1
Hotel staff was helpful. Room was right next to cleaning staff storage area. There was loud banging in the morning around 630am. Cleaning staff on weekdays were very good| weekend staff did not do well and missed a lot of cleaning. Overall pleasing| but would make sure I was not next to hotel cleaning staff storage on each level. Don't expect a great cleaning on the weekends.,1
Be aware there is a resort fee that runs about $20 a day which adds up over a long stay. Overall the hotel was very good| with a few minor tweaks I think it could be great as most hotels in the area are quite old. Also there was works right next door but we had no noise issues.,1
Hotel and staff very  nice! So close to the Disney parks after a long day of walking with kids! Breakfast in the morning was good with lots of options. Would stay here again!,1
One of the best hotels in Anaheim.   Super clean| great amenities - would recommend again to anyone!!!,1
Thank you to all the staff and especially the house keeping staff| our room attendant was the best. I think Irna was her name 4th floor west end of the hotel| THANK YOU.,1
This is a great little hotel. It's newer compared to other hotels close to Disney. It's about a 10 minute walk. It has free parking and free breakfast. A win/ win. It was clean and comfortable for me and my three preteen / teens. They swam in the pool / hot tub when we got back from Disney and I had a drink a drink at the bar. Perfect respite after a long day walking the park.,1
Great hotel near Disneyland. It is within walking distance| about a 15 min walk. Uber or Lyft is about a $6 drive| each way. Still worth it. Plus I love that the hotel has a good hot breakfast variety I highly recommend this for couples and families.,1
We had a blast. The room was clean| pool was amazing and breakfast was delicious! I definitely recommend over any hotel!,1
Friendly staff| clean room| comfortable beds.,1
Clean Hotel| friendly staff.,1
Super clean and kinda close to the park. Beds were a little harder than expected but tolerable,1
Lots of potential but lacking attention to detail. The room was a great size for our family but furniture was minimal and no frills like luggage racks. Bathroom has a sliding door but no lock. Pool and hot tub area was fantastic but pool towels were tiny and threadbare. Best breakfast I've had in a budget hotel - clean and well designed flow so you are not waiting in line all morning. Carpets are in desperate need of a deep clean and when we asked for extra linens for the rollaway the blankets had stains on them. The service guy was kind. They do have multiple EV chargers which is great.,1
Very Clean and quiet| good breakfast friendly staff,1
Very pleased! Everything was great and it's a very nice hotel. You'll love the lobby| and movie room for kids. Good breakfast| great pool| and wonderful service. A few blocks to walk to Disney but well worth the extra steps. It's next to the freeway but outside noise was very minimal.,1
New hotel. Great location. Breakfast was great and perfect location. Not too far from Disneyland. Easy walking and not as crowded. Very accommodating to guests for travel arrangements,1
The room was clean and the staff was extremely friendly. I would stay here again with no doubt.,1
Nice property| good breakfast.  Booked accessible room  - very spacious room.  :)  Requested room with roll-in shower - unfortunately not available with 2 Queen beds that we needed.,1
The hotel is recently renovated and clean| and within easy walking distance to Disneyland.,1
The room was spacious and clean. The towels were a little scratchy| but they were very clean. The lobby was very nice and the staff was nice. The breakfast was better than expected and the attendee was very helpful. Overall a nice stay and plenty of parking.,1
Definitely staying here again! The staff there are so nice. We were able to able to check in at 10:00am since there was a room available. The hotel is a 10minute walk to Disneyland. Couldn't be a better place to stay at!,1
Hotel is brand new. Clean. Easy check in. Busy place close to Disneyland. Good location.,1
Friendly staff|rooms were very nice & clean and breakfast was delicious! We will definitely book again!,1
Stayed here before| enjoyed their customer service| cleanliness and good breakfast. It's a new hotel so it's a nice place to stay. Things that were a little annoying; first stay toilet kept overflowing| second stay lights did not work in the bathroom.,1
Close to Disneyland and handy location. Rooms were big and comfy. Pool is big and lovely but not very child friendly. No real shallow end or children's play area anywhere.,1
Room was spacious and clean. Was helpful to have free laundry room available.  Pool was nice and fairly large.,1
hotel and poool was beautiful location great close to disney and restaurants,1
The outside waterpark is fun for kids| but the pool itself is not overly large for adults. There is not an indoor pool. Breakfast was great| with lots of extras. Staff is attentive to small details. We had an accessible room| and we could have held a barn dance in it.,1
This was the second time staying at this hotel. The rooms are very clean|beds are comfortable| breakfast is good and the staff are very friendly. It is a short walk to Disneyland. we will stay here again.,1
The Hotel is in a great location with great service and decent size pool.,1
Fabulous hotel| great size suite for our family of 4!  Amazing location| about 15 min walk to the Disneyland parks and plenty of restaurants!  Pool lovely| facilities lovely| breakfast ideal to fill up on each morning and very useful free parking!,1
Very clean and comfortable rooms. Staffs are all very friendly. The breakfast area is spacious so you won't have any problem finding a table for breakfast. We are very happy with our stay.,1
Pleasantly surprised by this property! Appears to be brand new| with all the amenities you could ask for including| free parking| full breakfast| salt water pool| full bar with happy hour| clean| great location and free chocolate chip cookies!,1
Great place to stay. Close to Disneyland and Angels Stadium. Great staff| super clean and breakfast was great.,1
Was perfect for what we needed! It was clean| convenient and offered everything we needed for our quick trip to Anaheim.,1
great hotel within distance to Disneyland.,1
The beds were very firm-the worst bed I have ever slept on in my life. Everything else was fine - except the food - do not plan to eat here. No room service either. If you don't mind firm beds then you will probably like it!,0
It was amazing. Beautiful hotel| great breakfast| gorgeous pool| nice rooms,1
Great location! Close enough to Disney| yet far enough to aboid all the disney traffic. The hotel was easy to find and very pleasing to the eye. Only down side is the construction site next door| however there was no construction being done at night. The staff was very friendly and answered all my questions (: the room itself was much bigger than expected and very clean! I would absolutely recommend this hotel for couples| families| etc! Very modern and newly decorated. Loved it!,1
Our stay at the country inn was great! Everyone is very friendly and professional and the hotel is perfect. The continental breakfast was a nice perk with a variety of food. The hotel is a short walk from Disneyland which was great!,1
As I commented in an earlier review of our stay this past weekend the staff at check In was ‚Äúokay‚Äù meaning it was perfunctory and for me not friendly but business like. I don't expect more than a friendly| welcoming check in. We were the only people checking in so they were not busy with other people. Also I was not aware of the $100 charge added to the rate for incidentals and the $19 resort fee we would not be using. The staff called me that night after seeing my rating and took off the $19 fee as a gesture of goodwill which was nice. But then most of the chargers did not work in the room so when we got up only one phone was charged. We had to share one that worked the am before we left. I told staff at check out and he said he would have maintenance check the room before considering my request for a slightly reduced rate for our inconvenience. He didn't call me back about it. On the way to the university to attend family orientation for our son I realized my phone charger was missing. I called the hotel and the staff personally went to see if it was in the one place where a charger worked. He said it wasn't there. I later had time to go through my bag and there was no phone charger. Perhaps the cleaning staff took it. I don't know. My husband and I shared his charger for the 10 hour family orientation at the university. I can afford a new charger but It was an inconvenience for sure.,0
We arrived early after a red eye flight. The hotel staff enabled us to check in to our room right away,1
within walking distance to DisneylandFree parking| free breakfastnew hotel| spacious room,1
This hotel had everything you'd need during your stay and more! Even if you forgot something they had a small store that had tons of stuff at great prices! Tip: buy a poncho at the hotel for $3 instead of at Disney for $9 if you need one! Also the staff was so friendly. There's a little hang out room for kids to watch movies| get popcorn and chill on comfy pillow chairs. There's also some good Quiet spots for couples to lounge at which is what my husband and I did| we got drinks at the bar and sat in front of the fire place. It's about a 12-15 minute walk to Disney but you can take the bus too bc there's a stop at the hotel. But get your day pass at the front desk first| bc they don't sell day passes on the bus. Also I ended up needing to do laundry and it's free to use| they sell laundry detergents at the little store too which was only $1.00! Parking was simple bc they have outdoor as well as garage parking available| we chose to park in the garage to keep our care out of the sun. It was just PERFECT! Rooms are spacious too and you can see the fireworks from the pool area or your room if you're lucky.,1
Hotel is walking distance to Disneyland| clean| quite| staff was helpful and courteous. We will definitely be back..,1
The breakfast was great| hotel was new and clean. Staff is always glad to help and friendly.,1
It's was a great experience! Comfortable beds| friendly staff| and the pool was clean and nice! Over all we had a good stay.,1
Worth every penny! Breakfast was delicious| the beds were comfy| lovely bathroom| and long swim hours| which the kids loved! I highly recommend this hotel.,1
Impeccable service fast and friendly.  Clean modern rooms| great breakfast with spacious room for guests| free laundry| pool is spacious| liked the extra blanket availability| great location. Highly recommend.,1
Close to Disneyland| clean nice pool comfortable beds friendly staff,1
Perfect distance from Disneyland| The room was very spacious and nicely decorated. Would definite stay here again and recommend to friends and family.,1
The hotel is nice| clean I liked!!!,1
It was a great experience. Spacey and comfortable room. Free parking. Nice easy walking distance to Disney land.,1
Great place| close to the parks| clean and great service| the place is quiet with the exception of the noise of the freeway.,1
Very Nice hotel and great pool,1
The room is clean and the bed is comfortable. The breakfast is very delicious that I would come back just for it. However| I didn't find it particularly ‚Äúfamily-friendly‚Äù. The furniture/interior of the room can be sometimes dangerous to little kids.,1
Overall| we loved our stay! The only thing we didn't like was the fact we paid for the parking| thinking it would be secure| but every single time we went in or out the barrier bar was always open. We were told our room key would open the gate| but we never even had to use it. Seems kinda pointless to pay a parking fee| while already paying for our stay| when it was really accessible to anyone.,1
The room and bathroom was clean. The bed was very comfortable and the room very spacious. Overall a pleasant stay.,1
It was really good we had a lot of fun really clean really lovely place I would love to go back there again,1
Not enough luggage carriers. When we arrived we waited half hour-45 mins. The door man said no ones has brought them down. Asked at the front they said if there was any available they would be right by the main entrance. When we checked out there was none for another 45 mins. To big of a hotel to only 4!,1
Perfect stay,1
Overall the experience was nice| unfortunately the AC in our room wasn't working to the fullest| but the room wasn't unbearable. Huge shout out to the maintenance men they were the most helpful and informative| many unique thing the hotel has to offer that would have been missed if they had not shared. Overall we would most likely come back again.,1
Overall it was fine| and quiet despite being close to the fwy. We really didn't spend much time there except to sleep which was comfortable. However as we were checking to room to make sure we got all our things we noticed what looked like food skewers behind the chair| a bottle of vitamins under the bed| and a contact behind the sick facet. A bit unnerving.,1
Very old not updated! Dirty| staff are not helpful| parking is not free||| not worth the price they charge!!! Definitely not coming back on this hotel!!!!,0
The rooms were very clean and the staff was very friendly.  No problem with reservations and very quiet rooms.  I reserved 2 rooms and the staff was able to get me rooms that were connected.,1
Great location. Right across the street from UCI. ust wish there was a refrigerator in room.  hut overall very good,1
Basic Doubletree| comfortable| and convenient. Fairly standard rooms with small-ish bathrooms. As is the case everywhere these days| they could use a few more employees| especially at the front desk. Parking and full breakfast are a bit of a rip-off.,1
We arrived to check in 3:34 am after long trip and we didn't find any one to help us to check in. And mad us wait one hour till they get an employee from their break time.  Witch they supposed to have some one else not leave ppl wait for hour.,0
Why wife slept on a urine stained bed!!! Please fix I don't want to report this to the health department,0
Excellent hotel! Would definitely recommend and stay again,1
At all the properties I'm getting harder,0
Had to pay for parking| then had to park around the corner in a parkade and walk back to hotel. Had to request a refridgerator and was charged extra for it. No Bell service| not enough luggage carts.,0
The check in was awful as there were only two attendants & an ULTRA long line of guests so it took a long time. Not good!Then out of the four elevators only one was working which was again not good. My elderly mother requires the elevator & there was a long wait to get to the room.,0
I had my truck broken into and all my tools stolen. Very very mad at the situation. Parked in the parking structure between the first and second floor next to the camera. Someone from the hotel told me that this is the second time in a few weeks this has happened. Figure out the problem and solve it!!!!!!!,0
I didn't like the fact that you had to pay for wifi and some people had to pay for parking as well. I've stayed at A lower rate hotel and never had a problem with having to pay for wifi,0
I call to request to clean my room and the lady name Jennifer say ok and when we came back to our room  it wasn't clean I went to the front desk and I realized that the one who answered me in the morning Jennifer is the manager,1
On the day of arrival| there was no waterI was not told that as I checked inHad to wait about an hour for the water to start upThe linen was not very niceAs it was washed and smelled cleaned the sheets had stains,1
I'm going to try and make this short and to the point. The first night we arrived and the sheets smelt awful. I mean awful. It smelt like seafood and just stunk up the whole bed that my girlfriend was uncomfortable. We requested new sheets but the smell was not gone and we had to spray perfume every night to somewhat get the smell out. I didn't know they passed out welcoming cookies when you check in so the lady must've forgot but I got them the third day when a couple received them upon check in and I asked for it. Don't think I'm going to stay at another Hilton/Doubletree hotel again.,0
Absolutely NOT what I would expect of a Hilton property!! Elevators down and had to use the service elevator which we had to navigate through the kitchen| how the fire department hasn't shut this property down is in question !! The PAID parking was a JOKE !| over packed and had to park in a handicap spot and worried all night about a violation or being towed !!!!!! Won't stay there ever again !,0
Only one elevator worked at this property out of the four they have. On average was a 20min wait for an elevator. Absolutely ridiculous. No discount in stay for the inconvenience. Highly disappointed in Double Tree Hotel.,0
The staff at the counter was great they where very attentive and fast| i choose this hotel because I have always stayed at doubletree hotels in the past and they have been great and this one was one of the worst ones first elevators where not functioning during our stay there was only 1 elevator working at the time and for about 200 plus guest is ridiculous especially with the COVID pandemic going on and you have an elevator with like 15 people crammed in also the parking structure was very detached from the hotel wich they still charged a 25 dollar fee for parking per day I think that as much as a client pays for the stay they should reimburse for the inconvenience of elevator not functioning and we stayed there for 5 days and elevator was never fixed we waited for about 30 minutes before we can get on the elevator to get tot the lobby very disappointed with  our stay there,0
Location only had 1 working elevator on the property.Would have to wait 30-45min to use elevator,0
The property clean,0
The parking fee was not disclosed at check in.  So a surprise bill of $23 charge will surprise you if you use the parking out front it the hotel.   Sneaky charges are not a good way to have repeat customer.   Just one of the four elevators was working and the room faced a hospital and all you can hear all night were sirens.,0
Very comfortable,1
Hotel has definitely been ran down. Out of the 4 elevators only 1 worked. It would take 20 minutes just to get a elevator down to the lobby or up to your room. The hotel just seemed a little dirty and the room floors where somewhat sticky. On our way to checking out we decided to use the service elevators to get down quicker and we ended up getting stuck and having to climb down 16 floors with luggage. I wouldn't stay here again,0
Elevator was broken 15 minutes wait. They do not clean room unless you asked for it.  I booked two room l requested to be next to each other | when I checked in they said you have to pay extra if you you need them next to each other so I have no choice but to pay the extra for each room for each night.,0
Staff was friendly. However there was only one working elevator| which means that we waited for at least 15-20 mins to board the elevator to our room. Not staying here again.,0
This was truest a home away from him.,1
Great check-in experience. I got my cookies & check out was good ! Was happy that they still do breakfast in the morning üëç,1
When I checked in the Hotel had NO reservation from Expedia. Luckily the Doubletree was able to check me in| but I paid for it. The clerk called Expedia but they had no record.,0
Everything was good but for the price for the parking is stupid $24 a day and they dont service the rooms until you leave they only take amenities to the room. It also sucked that rooms don't have microwave or refrigerator but we enjoyed the nice pool they let us stay till 12am,1
No complementary breakfast,1
Hotel needs a lot of repairs. Only one elevator working. Took 20 minutes to get to the lobby| couldn't take the stairs and carry luggage and kids. Hotel did not have any luggage carts available. Charged for parking and when parking was full was asked to park across the street.,0
We reserved the handicap room but it was not really handicap friendly - just the bare minimum if that.,0
People don't waste your hard earned money with this hotel!! Plumbing is terrible beds aren't comfortable there's no parking and only one elevator worked,0
I don't want to go there any more.,0
It was horrible someone tried to open the door inside the room the one that connects the rooms also no fridge in this hotel don't recommend this hotel at all specially if u are traveling with family,0
The hotel elevators were not working | parking is a walk away | the staff not very friendly | hotel wasn't vey clean and they didn't even have the double tree cookies . We had to use the stairs to get to and from the 7th floor .  Bad experience| my advice is find another hotel !,0
The only that I didn't like was I wasn't made aware of the $23.00 parking fee per day‚Ä¶ The other thing that bothered me was when I checked in I wasn't informed that I wouldn't be receiving cleaning service as I was only staying for two nights| but that I could come down and get clean towels and any other essentials.. The 3rd complaint is that I returned to the Hotel around 10:55-11:00 and I couldn't find a parking space that I was being charged $23.00 per day‚Ä¶ It took over 10 minutes before I was able to park at this hotel‚Ä¶.,1
Came into a room that had a damp floor and loud dryer being ran! Toilet backed up and sink backed up. Then while they where fixing the the plumbing was accused and charged immediately $250 for a smoking charge when I wasn't even there an hour. WiFi didn't work I will not stay here again nor recommend anyone waste there hard earned money for this hotel. Also they charge $23 per night for parking which there was none!! Why cause the gates are left open and anyone can park there for free!!,0
I was charged $200 extra,0
No refrigerator No microwave 10.00 to rent mini refrigerator bye the day 23.00 for parking bye the day No Free Continental Breakfast No view of Disneyland No heated pool No free cookies,0
Ferdinand was a great assistance at the front desk ensuring we received complimentary internet with our Hilton Honors.,1
The hotel room carpet was so sticky I had to wear my shoes the entire time. The bed sheets and bath towels felt like sand paper my husband got a rash on his face I had bug bites all over me!,0
Upon booking I requested a pack and play crib for my four month old baby to sleep in during our stay. Prior to arriving I received a confirmation email that a pack and play would be provided for my room. Upon check in I stated that I needed a pack and play brought to my room then went to my room and waited but they never showed up. I called the front desk to let them know that no pack and play had shown up to my room when they then assured me one would show up but after a significant amount of time waiting no pack and play showed up to my room. Which then forced me to make do with what I had to create a safe sleeping space for my baby since nothing showed up for her to sleep in.,0
access to everything very close by,1
I did not like that you have to pay if you staying at the hotel|  but that stupid in Los Angeles|  CA .nothing you can do ! They always try to get you from somewhere!,1
Highly disappointed. I used to love staying here for my Disney trips. I understand things have changed due to covid| however when it is advertised on the hotels website and on hotels.com that they still have a free theme park shuttle| yet when you arrive they have no shuttle service anymore. It is extremely upsetting. They are aware that it is still showing on their website that they have a free parks shuttle and have yet to change it.  Being that I was over 3 miles away from the park I was counting on the shuttle as advertised and had to spend way too much money on Uber's back and forth for 3 days| so that extra cost and inconvenience was upsetting| I would have rather put that money towards a hotel closer to the park in order to walk. Also due to covid they are doing a modified house keeping service| where they only come on one of that days of your choosing. We stayed 3 nights and asked for house keeping to come on the second day. They never came| had to ask the night manager for new towels and we never had anything in the room refreshed or replenished. If you play to stay here for your next Disney trip| don't you will be disappointed and frustrated.,0
The property was poorly staffed.  Gust rooms were not cleaned daily.  Had to get the towels and soap from the front desk because no servicing of the rooms by housekeeping.  Public bathrooms horrendous.,0
Everythinhg goood,1
There is a $23 per day parking fee that is not included in the booking price so it is a surprise when you check in. The Alo hotel across the street has free parking| stay there. Also| thermostat in room did not work.,0
My husband and I only stayed one night. Staff was nice but was not dress in uniform| that for me did not look professional. The room is a little outdated but very clean which I loved. The bed was soo comfortable. They charge $23 per day for parking. I didn't like that| but no other choice had to pay. It was nice and quiet and many stores around to shop and get food. Minutes away from downtown Disney. Great view at night| got to see the helicopter from the room view at the 12th floor. I would stay here again.,1
Clean and great,1
Staff was very helpful,1
It is a great location| very nice stay,1
Been going there for 30 years love location and lots of space to .ove around,1
Love love love double tree hotel. Super clean and friendly.,1
I like the area it was very safe. I didn't like the hotel not cleaning the room every day.,1
Bes were comfortable and the cookies are to die for.,1
They were never around to answer the phone when we called to complain our ac wasn't working both nights! And they were always under staffed on the front desk and The lines were always too long for someone to wait to talk to them. When you are there for a short time you really don't want to spend it dealing with problems at the hotel. The manager Liz still hasn't reached out to me after I complained. The towels and sheets seems not clean and the pillows were horrible,0
"Overall property is not bad| just not the greatest either. The simple fact that I have to pay $23.00 dollars a day so that I can park on your property is totally unacceptable and further more when you mention it to the front desk at the time of your check in as to why you were not made aware of this they have the nerve to say ""I GUESS YOU DIDN'T READ THE SMALL PRINT THEN DID YOU"" Really? I'm already paying to stay at your hotel and not cheap if I may add and for you to come and tell me after I have traveled for 5 hours to get there that you have some hidden fees that you don't disclose up front at the time of the reservation on the website and you need to charge me for parking is totally unacceptable.",0
My overall stay was pleasing| however for what I paid I would have expected a few more amenities in my room such as a mini fridge and/or a microwave. Then there were a few suspicious guests I had seen during my stay. The first night I had seen someone being escorted out by security and another time there was a family leaving and the parents looked to be under the influence of something. This made me wonder if I overpaid for this hotel. This hotel is in prime location. It's right next to outlet mall| movie theater| plenty of restaurants| and just up the street from Angel Stadium. Now I know all these places around the hotel made helped establish such a high price| in my opinion. But $23/per night for parking is ridiculous. This was the big negative for me. Plus the arm bar for entering the parking didn't work or got stuck half the time I was there. I should've probably asked for my money back just for parking.,1
Its really nice view and everything is close by. Also its by the freeway too,1
No usb charging ports. Bed was ridiculously hard.nothing special about this place. Its across from hospital. Lots of siren noise,1
I've stayed here on business multiple times in the past few years.  Definitely my go-to hotel when I'm in the area. Always clean and good sanitation during this COVID situation. I was scheduled to be there a week but has to leave due to an emergency and the clerk at the front desk couldn't have been nicer about everything. Her name is Kasia and she was simply one of the nicest people I've ever met.,1
Excellent service extremely caring people that help you,1
I liked the room| though I'm sure I requested a 1 bed and they gave me 2 but it was Valentine's Day so I'm sure there was a shortage. I enjoyed my stay regardless,1
So my family arrived and everything appeared to be in good condition| however when my daughter was using the restroom the toilet was backed up and the television wasn't working. We decided to leave,0
It was really good| but not happy with 23 Dollars parking fee... The rate was good till they try to get you with parking fees.!!!!!!Hotel must come with free parking...Just like going to a restaurant and they charge for using the Fork.!!!!,1
Everything was nice and clean except for the,1
Great atmosphere. Friendly service. Would definitely recommend,1
Front desk person gave me inaccurate & WRONG info about restaurants| food  availability| times| etc. Did not inform me about Internet connection! Made for a quite inconvenient evening! Otherwise - room was great.,1
Great place to stay. I would have liked a mini fridge though. My room did not have one.,1
Arrived at property and they said they had never confirmed the reservation. Expedia had sent me an email confirming reservation. Had to drive and look for a hotel at midnight!!,0
Very clean and friendly. The staff were extremely helpful.,1
Thought being on the 17th floor| it would be quiet| not so. Facing a major intersection| Chapman and City Dr.| it was like sleeping on the sidewalk right next to the traffic. Also there was a tapping noise coming from the room above us.,0
I liked the fountains outside that had ducks swimming in it. I liked the comforters on the bed| they keep you at just the right temperature.,1
This was a change from my usual visits.  I was fine with no one servicing the rooms. I picked up fresh towels at the front desk. I did object to the policy of having guests leave their dirty towels outside their doors. These towels were only picked up once a day. Extremely unsanitary and made the halls look like a low rent motel.  They could have least required guests to place towels in the  plastic bag every closet has.  Why not have guests call the front desk to send someone to pick up these bags? Few people are staying at the hotel so it is not like this would be a huge task. I will not be returning.,0
Husband and i had a great little get-away. Room had great view| and staff were all so nice. Wish parking was included. Paid 23.00 per night. We will stay again,1
The staff was rude and the mattress was horrible,0
I didn't like the parking.  $23 per night. You would think parking would be included with the room.,1
Bed was super comfy. Stayed for 5 nights| Disappointed that we had to pay full price for the room & $23/night to park there w/no house cleaning services (due to COVID). We Had to go downstairs to get fresh towels| sheets| coffee| etc. Staff was friendly,1
I liked the staff and the cleanliness they kept the entirety of the hotel.,1
I booked for tonight. But i only stayed for 1 night because of family emergency. They wont refund the 2nd night. I always book with Hilton but i guess this will be my last time with them.,0
Great location| very nice staff. Room was plain but nice and a good size,1
The staff was very welcoming and friendly. They gave us warm cookies and the drinks at the bar are amazing.,1
Friendly staff| the room was clean and the bed was comfortable,1
Awesome place to stay the only negative was hot tub wasn't working and elevators were slow but room was comfortable and very convenient to go to lots of places beaches restaraunts Disney and anahiem stadium definitely will be back good bang for the buck,1
What a great way to spend the night with your property| the location and staff are outstanding. Plus the cookies|,1
Loved itBed was uncomfortable - felt like a spring was sticking in my back No refrigerator üò¢,1
Worst place to stay at. Overly pricey! Definitely do not recommend. I payed off my room & when I went in to do my check in they had sold my room. How do you sell a room that has already been payed for? Had to sleep in a small room in which they brought twin beds| super uncomfortable.,0
We book a 2 double beds room but when we arrived| all 2 double beds room gone and they gave us one king bed room instead.  Also there is no refrigerator in the room and my son need to drink milk so we can't keep his milk cold.,0
Very close to Disneyland and freeway. The cookies were also good.,1
Amazing views close to everything! Angels stadium Disneyland etc,1
Unfortunately my personal property was taken from my room. I reported it to the front desk. It took three phone calls to find someone to come talk to me. The head of security finally came. She was very unprofessional. Didn't bother to introduce herself to me or apologize. She handed me a paper to fill out| asked if the phone number I listed was the best number to reach me and said ok and started to walk away. I had to ask what was going to happen next. She rolled her eyes at me and said someone will look in to it and get in contact with me. I was so angry that there was no communication about the process of what to expect. She didn't even look at what I wrote to understand what happened. I then asked her for a business card with her name and title. She walked away to get it. I then realized I didn't have a copy of what I filled out so when she returned I asked if I could take a picture of it. She then asked if I would like a copy. Of course I said yes. When she returned I told her I thought she was very unprofessional. She stated she just had surgery the day before on her mouth and really couldn't talk. I told her that maybe someone else should be helping me then. More than 24 hours later I have not heard from the property or the hotel chain. Very angry and extremely disappointed.,0
The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. They made check-in and check-out quick and easy. They provided complimentary water and fresh baked cookies. The view of the city was what I had expected.,1
This hotel will nickel and dime you-you pay for parking and for Wifi. I stay up here once a month and was tired of staying in cheaper| albeit noisy hotels so I booked here hoping for quiet. It's right next to UCI-so constant ambulances and helicopters. Also| you have to pay for parking and no free coffee-most hotels have free coffee/tea.  $23-not advertised when I booked. And theres no free Wifi| which is absurd in 2020. I'm headed back to the cheaper hotels with free WiFi.,0
Good experience in a clean hotel and in a good location.,1
The staff was exceptionally friendly . They accommodated my parents with a disabled room and me with a room with a view of the fireworks at Disneyland,1
Front desk people on morning shift during our stay were arrogant and not pleasing| poor service and not sincere. I was given wrong information| before we arrive I phoned the front desk I was told that the shuttle to Disney park is free | but as soon as we checked in they said it is not free and I was given the rates for the fees of the shuttle service. Was so disappointed I will not recommend this place to stay. Also just to add I thought that this place is the one close to Disney when we arrive at the wrong location the one near Anaheim convention they said they cannot do something to help me change the hotel location so we have to bear with the situation and stay to this Orange location for the rest of our vacation. So frustrating  :(,0
Very comfortable and so convenient to UCI Medical Center. Only disappointment was $23 daily parking fee,1
I asked for housekeeping and never got my room cleaned up!,1
Clean room and comfortable bed. Bathroom makes a lot weird noises.,1
Great location| easy to get to| hotel was very nice| check in staff were beyond friendly and gave me some cookies and water.  Room was very nice and great view. Thanks,1
I like the service.. also it was cleaned great job,1
Advertise free breakfast? Not so! Checked in and room was occupied? Embarrassing! Sewer smell in room.,0
Our small family of four stayed one night for Supercross. We stay here everytime and we love it. Great service and friendly staff. Also conveniently located to Angel Stadium.,1
The staff service was Fast and nice | the elevators is so fast| I stay for 3 days never have to wait for the elevator .,1
Stayed here for a family trip. Their service is very good| the room was clean and cozy (the window glass needs a bit of cleaning from outside - minor thing). Overall great experience.,1
Great customer service. The hotel is near Disneyland. And the cookies are delicious.,1
Very friendly and clean. Good experience all around,1
Customer service is great ! place is comfortable and peaceful,1
Every thing is good! Nice atention and service the ser ice in the honor floor is very confirtable and feel so good,1
My vehicle got damaged while parked on there property,0
Great location to adventure out to shop and restuarant,1
Everything was great except the steep parking charges.,1
Beautiful facility with friendly staff. The hotel is immaculate,1
Great stay! Beautiful welcoming lobby and staff. Room was clean and stay was perfectly comfortable after our long day of fun at Disneyland!,1
Best Mattress I've ever slept on. Nice bar downstairs. Relatively safe area. Recommended!,1
The property was great the problem was at check-in| they charged my one night stay three times. Be very careful not to insert your card until they have all information account on there system.,0
Second time staying here. Love this hotel| only negative is the parking price. $22 a day. Adds up when you stay for a long period,1
Awesome stay ... pleasant and friendly staff . Highly recommended . Great location,1
Very clean and great service fast check in wonderful view,1
Very spacious hotel. Cold atmosphere with an unwelcoming and lazy front desk and hotel staff.  Unfriendly and rude front desk manager.,0
One of the rooms I reserved...there was no housekeeping member to clean a guest room.,1
Location is close to Disneyland with $6 shuttle service.,1
Everything was nice and clean only thing that was a little off putting is I could hear any time someone would flush the toilet from the floors above since the drain pipes probably run along the walls.,1
We stayed for 5 nights at the end of Nov. Great location for Disneyland and the highways to L.A. and the beaches (Newport & Huntingdon).Would recommend this hotel for families like us.,1
This is a nice hotel the only problem was the up charge when I got there.,1
Greeted at the front desk by Kasia.  What a wonderful| sweet| pleasant and helpful person she is.  Bell service was fast| friendly and efficient.  The valet had my car ready before I even made it to the lobby.  Fantastic!!!  The only minor disappointment was the restaurant.  Thought it was a dinner house but more of a casual lunch type fare. Wait time for dinner from seated to dining was 40 minutes.  Service was very friendly though. Overall| wonderful experience.,1
Liked: good location| fancy hotel Dislike: You have to pay for everything even water. The bed was broken,0
I stayed in three hotels over Thanksgiving Weekend - By far my favorite!,1
Everything was as expected.  Very nice hotel. Great location.  I think the $22 charge to self park over night is excessive however.,1
We liked the location to food| shopping and Chapman University.,1
Unfortunately it was not a pleasant stay this time around. I had water coming through the ceiling and there didn't seem to be any urgency by the staff to check into it or even check on me. I subsequently checked out early as a result.,0
The hotel trip seemed so amazing until I realized that my wallet was stolen by house-keeping. When I talked to the front desk| they told me to fill out a security report so I did. After that| nothing was taken care of. I was extremely disappointed in the way they handled the situation. I'm not asking to comp my entire stay| but something should have been done. I feel the manager should have apologized to me! I would have even appreciated a complementary breakfast. I am extremely disappointed in not only the staff stealing my property and going through my boyfriend's bag while we were gone| but completely dismissing my feelings as a person who felt violated. I wish it would have been handled differently. Unfortunately I will never stay at this hotel again.,0
Nice and clean place and quiet love staying here its my 3 time coming,1
Kept the room clean everyday| city view| working ac,1
The pillows were very flat and not comfortable at all.,1
We enjoy staying here as Hilton Honors guests and being next door to our daughter and son-in-law who live at the Amli.  Very convenient. Lots of restaurants and a very safe area.,1
the elevator access pad was missing and wires were exposed the elevator status light panel was missing and wires were exposedno one at the front desk when checking out so i just left,1
They  were full and rent my room to someone else|they moved me to to a small room| and next day I had to pack again and move to a biger room|totally inconvenient.  I was expecting something else than just an apology,0
Nice room| convenient location. Nothing spectacular| The only thing I missed was a mini frig| as the booking said it had one| would of been a big help| there was no frig or microwave.,1
No mini-fridge| no microwave.  The staff was very loud in the morning speaking loudly in the hallways,0
Close to the outlet stores and close to disneyland,1
The bathroom is awful! No counter just a wire basket on the wall. Hard bed. And this constant rushing water noise. Just awful. One of the worst hotels I've ever stayed at.,0
Great place to stay. Closed to near entertainment places,1
Disneyland not far and the orange outlets is 5 minutes walk,1
I needed some alone time and decided to stay a night at the hotel! best. decision. ever. service was amazing and super accommodating! everything was very VERY clean and at very affordable price!,1
Ease of check in and out| friendly staff and clean,1
The facility was nice but my reservation was for a king bed and instead received too very small doubles. Two people are unable to fit in those beds. So we had to sleep separately. Then the parking sucks. I drove around for about 35 minutes looking for parking that I paid for.,0
I had to check out early due to a family emergency. I was charged $100 more on top of what I had already paid so it ended up costing me $500 for one night!!!! Ridiculous,0
Great hotel. First we loved the magnificent cookies. Great location| wonderful service| good gym| nics atmosphere. We will return to the hotel in the future.,1
Very nice hotel close to angel Stadium. Restaurant and bar on location. Had to pay a separate rate for parking.,1
A little to posh for us but an enjoyable stay.,1
We arrived at 10:30pm and were told that our rooms would not be ready until 12:30am possibly 1am THE NEXT DAY.  This was because they allowed a large group to check out late and did not get the rooms ready. There were many many other guests waiting for their rooms as late as 11:30 pm. We had just flown in and were tired. We ended up finding another hotel. How can they run a business that way?,0
Great location| very friendly staff| and overall beautiful hotel. Overnight guest parking is 22$,1
While I did get to see this property on the outside I never made it to my room. I called to let them know if would need to check in a few hours late and someone accidentally cancelled my reservation. Then they informed me they were booked for the night. I missed my work conference due to this error. The hotel did not offer or try to fix this error. Only Expedia did.,0
We arrived after a long sayid travel from the U.K. to be greeted by the wonderful Blake. He was so helpful at check in and even remembered our names when bumping into him around the hotel during our stay.Christopher on the hotel bar was also amazing!! So friendly| chatty & welcoming.,1
We didn't have e  refrigerator  I the room when we I asked they they said $10 for to rent one!!,0
Amazing. Convenient location and immaculate room.,1
They were so sweet! It was my wedding night and they upgraded us without charge and gave us drinks on them! So happy with our experience at this Double Tree location.,1
I like the proximity to Disneyland. Didn't like how the refrigerator was extra fee when ALL the other Double Trees I've stayed in just came with the room. There was a leak in the roof of the bathroom. Also| cookies were not always available unlike other double trees where it was available 24/7,1
Very nice hotel with convenient access to UCI Medical Center.,1
Didn't like anything AC barely worked| bed was stiff| they charge $24 for parking| you have to pay for WiFi| valet took up the entire entrance you couldn't even pull up without getting harassed. For a Hilton double tree it was very poorly ran and constructed,0
The staff was great but the coffee bar & store weren't open enough,1
Just stay at the Ayers across the street| you have to join a program for WiFi and for a room with a refrigerator and microwave it's extra.... cash grab and on top of paying 175 dollars per night there's a 22 dollar parking fee...,0
Very nice hotel in a great location.,1
Staff was very friendly and professional,1
It was in a great location| clean and had great amnenities,1
Great hotel with okay prices,1
The location was close to the Honda Center and Angels stadium which were the two places we were visiting. Fun little bar and beautiful pool!,1
Excelent customer service property is very clean nice,1
Good location close to Honda Center| convenient access to interstate. Room could have been a little nicer and parking is expensive but otherwise good room,1
Quick and easy check in and check out process. Friendly and helpful staff. Parking very close to entrance.,1
Great staff so helpful| but room had a moldy stinch,1
The bathroom door is in a awkward position. Maybe suggest a sliding door option since the bathroom is smaller.,1
Amazing staff| so comfortable| highly recommend!,1
Loved the location and how close it was to the freeway| the outdoor mall as well as the amusement parks.  The Valet gentlemen were all very attentive and the staff was incredibly friendly.  The only thing we didn't like was having to pay to park our car as the fees quickly add up.   Other than that it was perfect.,1
"Paeking lot was very messy. We didn't have a fridge in our room and I didn't know it would be an "" upgrade"" to have a fridge in a hotel room. Took us over an hour in the line to check in.",0
I liked the location and how close it was to the Disneyland park . But I did hate the fact I did purchase a tub in my room not a stand up shower ! It was very disappointing that I wasn't give the WiFi password or anything thing! Then to top it all off the the towels in the bathroom hanging on the shower glass door and a couple under the sink all had stains and crust on them like if they have been used before and never changed !,0
Great stay ..................|..........|..........,1
This hotel was a rip off.  Any changes to your reservation will cost you couple of hundreds.,0
I had a reservation and they sent me to another hotel because of a plane delay. When we got here they said| ‚Äúsorry here's some cookies‚Äù and that they were sending us to another hotel. When getting in at 2 am because you're driving down it's not convenient for you to switch hotels... I wish I was called or told when I called before we left Vegas that we wouldn't get to stay here although we should have been priority because we had a reservation!! We get to the next hotel now and then they tell us ‚Äúsorry we're not giving you your one king bed you book but not a double queen room‚Äù.... was so upset! They then told us ‚Äúoh but here you can have free breakfast (we didn't care because that's not the point. was it nice? yes but it wasn't what we asked for either) They whole thing is we didn't even get what we paid for and everything was a huge inconvenience. I'm too tired to argue at 2 am (I'm sure you'd understand this). I only stay at Hilton's and Marriotts and I'm 25. I have a long life ahead of me in which I'll be traveling more in the future to come. Never will I stay at this Hilton again| I'd rather stay at Marriott where they have nice rooms and they don't send their guests somewhere else to stay!!,0
Awesome Hotel!!! This has been an amazing experience so far| customer service is outstanding| very clean| and flat out amazing!,1
Good value| but the $22/day parking fee was a unwelcome surprise.,1
Amazing stay. Nice view of fire works from Disney.,1
I recommend this hotel| check in check out was fast and easy.With 4 elevators you get to your room real quick.Pool and jacuzzi were clean.The staff real friendly and helpful every time we arrive with baggage.The only thing is that you have to pay for parking and WiFi ü§î,1
It was wonderful service. The last morning our shower wouldn't come on.,1
Really nice rooms| plenty of electrical/charger ports| very nice and friendly staff!,1
Love hotel i would stay there get,1
The hotel was super nice and a great location from Disney.  The staff was really friendly. I would recommend,1
I stayed at the DoubleTree Hotel and it was a terrible experience. On our first night there| July 5th| there was a huge earthquake and we evacuated on our own (along with many other occupants at the hotel). There was no security measure or protocol to ensure that we got out safe. This involved many people running through the stairs on their own| without any guidance from the hotel. When we got downstairs| there was no direction or anything. The hotel did not even address this in any capacity| which is very dangerous and negligent. Secondly| the bedsheets were very odd| or maybe it was the bed. We could not sleep all night due to the constant itching from the bed/bedsheets. It was a terrible stay and the staff was not trained to be attentive to our needs and safety as they should have been. Very horrible experience.,0
Staff is very friendly| never a long line to wait for anything. Close to mall and Medical center,1
Clean rooms| nice bar and restaurant| convenient location.,1
Helpful staff| clean room and great service.,1
The hotel took me to an amount on the car park with I read in the show that you have a free parking,0
Beautiful| comfortable| very clean hotel. Easy walk or Uber to Angel's Stadium. Easy Uber to Disneyland.,1
Excellent service| everyone was very kind and the beds clean and comfortable| nice experience. Thanks,1
It was amazing! The hotel is beautiful and there are plenty of ways to stay entertained including a tennis court! The surrounding area is amazing as well; there is an outlet mall about 10 minute walking distance from the hotel.,1
had a great night stay after a long drive.,1
Stayed here one night for a work training. They let me check in early because the room was ready| which is always a big plus for me. The room was comfortable and clean. Everything worked well| though the thermostat instructions were not as clear as they could be. There was no fridge in the room| which I knew ahead of time| but I wish they had them in every room. The food for the training was prepared by the hotel and was pretty good. I didn't use the pool or eat at the other places inside. Very business-oriented hotel. Within walking distance of the outlets at Orange and UC Irvine| not really Disneyland. No free Wi-fi unless you're a rewards member.,1
Friendly and helpful staff.  Shopping and dining within walking distance. Hospital is across street so a little noisy with arriving ambulances.,1
We stayed the weekend at this hotel for a basketball tournament. When we checked| everyone was given a warm yummy cookie and check in was a breeze. The bell hop helped us to our room| super friendly and told us all about the near by attractions. We ate in the bar area restaurant| great bar tender and good food. The rooms are clean| spacious and have all the basic amenities that you would need. The hotel is with in walking distance of great restaurants and good shopping.,1
Pretty good| friendly staff| clean| quiet| no complaints except soda machine didn't work| had to seek one out on another floor,1
It was an alright property| far from Disney and you have to pay for shuttles so if you're staying at Disney I wouldn't recommend it,1
Great location friendly staff and free wark cookies,1
Very nice and clean. Great restaurant. Extremely friendly staff,1
No microwave/fridge in the room| parking was a little pricey and a small lot meant some days were harder to find parking. Good location| room was quiet and clean| staff super friendly on check in.,1
Other than the matress being a bit soft| for my liking| this hotel stay was completely enjoyable.,1
The night manager (Angelo) was extremely rude and uncooperative,0
Friendly customer service check in was quick and easy,1
Wonderful stay as always at the Doubletree. They go above and beyond to make your stay comfortable.,1
It was great staying at this hotel. Very friendly staff. Welcoming. Feel like home atmosphere. Love to stay more.,1
There was no water available in lobby. After 11 hours of travel| water would be nice.  We requested adjoining rooms.  This was not presented to us.  Our two rooms were close| but still made it difficult to manage our kids and daily activities. No one told us about renovations when we arrived.  They were in our hallway.  Furniture was blocking halls.  Noise was loud.  Could not rest after lunch. Called to ask about weekend work. They returned call and left message not answering my question.  Hotel restaurant service was awful.  Slow and unpleasant service. Our third time at this hotel and first time unhappy.,0
My reservation clearly stated WiFi and when I asked for the WiFi code| they told me it wasn't included and wanted me to pay extra for this basic service. The warm cookie at check in was a nice touch| but I would have rather had 20mb of data instead of 20 chocolate chips,0
Staff very friendly and helpful.,1
Very clean| very loud vibrating noise in room on and off,1
Overall it is a decent hotel. The down sides were the fire truck sirens and helicopter landing pad outside our window. We had a negative experience when we went for breakfast our first morning. The two of us got there about 10 minutes before the buffet was ending and were treated rudely by staff; they made it clear that they did not want to serve us. We chose not to stay and eat because of the lack of hospitality. We brought the situation up to staff at the front counter and they said sorry but no offer to follow up was made. So| we didn't eat at the restaurant. The upsides - bed was comfy| the room and surroundings were clean and the concierge was helpful with our questions about the area.,1
Check in was fast| even with a huge line. The staff was professional| friendly| and fast paced.,1
We had an excellent experience at this hotel| the staff that we dealt with were very kind and accommodating with our requests. We highly recommend this hotel.,1
Paid for this hotel a month prior| in full for 5 nights| states no additional charges....until you arrive and they inform you it's $25 parking EACH DAY. Not garaged| in an open parking lot. Had to speak with management to get fees paid and they weren't polite about it. Hotel very clean| everything in working order| very small bathroom in the room with double beds though.,0
Loved the cookies,1
Great family friendly property close to Disneyland. Easy access with ART shuttle leaving from car park. Directly opposite Outlets at Orange with good food and entertainment options.,1
Sevice was bad. Room was not clean. I found used coffe cup in the coffe meachine. Hotel towels had someone else's hair. Overall| my room was not clean.,0
The bathtub was filthy. No working ice machines on floor. Empty water dispenser in fitness room. Tv not working,0
Staff was very nice.  Did not like paying $22 a night for parking.,1
AC in the room was broken. Trying to get a early check in was frustrating to say the least. Paying that much to park overnight as a guest of the hotel is insane to me.,0
We were there for the NCAA tournament. Great location| excellent service and great price!,1
Food and service at the bar & lounge was great! All employees were awesome. Jacuzzi was broken and gym was not good. But wouldn't be a deal breaker for another stay. For the price it was worth it.,1
Hotel was clean and the people that worked there were very polite and accomadating,1
Front desk was very rude very unprofessional with Jasmin she is the worst front desk I ever had to deal with in a hotel! on top of this there was a charge on my wife's bill which I did NOT even walk into the restaurant at the hotel!,0
We were very close to UCI Orange for an appointment.,1
Definitely the worst doubletree I've ever stayed at. Outside and lobby are very nice and clean. The hotel rooms not so much. Out of date but the worst part is the cleanliness! Upon walking in. We stepped on a bunch of crumbled up oreos (so obviously they didnt vacuum). Carpet was dirty and sticky in general. The sheets smelled overwhelming of bleach but had stains. We go into the bathroom and counters are wet and sticky. But the worse part but the tub appeared to have chewed up food or something at the bottom| along with a bunch of hair and dirt. The picture here does not do justice. I couldn't bathe the kids in this. Had to have them stand on a towel and just shower| as it was late and we had to go to bed. To top it off| the tv and alarm clock also were not working. One of the hotel managers sent a text the next day asking about my stay and I told him what happened and his response was he would talk to the housekeeping manager. Yeah| sure! Definitely not the standards of a typical Doubletree and surely would not bother staying here again.,0
Decent price for a nice property.  Staff was friendly and property is well situated and good for a couple nights' stay.,1
Nice and easy as always. Friendly at check in. Valet and bell staff is always helpful and great to talk to. The cookies at checkin are always a nice touch.,1
Everything was to my satisfaction. Clean| good amenities in the room| decent desk service. Easy temperature control in the room. Comfy bed.,1
Good overall| a bit old. Cleanness dose not meet the price.,1
Close to a lot of great places. Easy check in/out.,1
They didn't clean my room one of the days.  Had to call for more towels and cleaning went home.,1
Front desk not very helpful. Gave us accessible room without letting us know.,0
I definitely enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The only thing that wasn't accurate according to the hotels.com description is the Disneyland Shuttle. They have another service instead that costs extra. I just used Lyft to and from the Park instead.,1
Dissatisfied with the Orbitz lack of disclosure prior to my accepting the assignment.,1
Great hotel| friendly staff! Wish the drinks were cheaper and wish it has a free breakfast!,1
They didn't have a double bed room for us. so I had to sleep on a roll away,0
The rooms had small double beds| that couldn't fit two people on. The fridge was broken| room service wouldn't answer the phone. We won't ever stay there again.,0
Our stay was awesome! Clean space| well lit. We lucked out and our room faced Disneyland so we got to see the fireworks show from afar.  Shuttle to Disneyland was great; although it was a mad dash by customers to get on.  The only negative I have to say is that the beds were too small to sleep comfortably next to a second person.,1
Nice hotel. Free shuttle to disney.,1
Air conditioner can not be set below 65¬∞ F| otherwise very comfortable,1
Checked in before going to Disney but no keys until after 12 which when we called no one told us. Front desk didn't add me to the reservation so I couldn't get keys without my husband. Tub dirty on entering. Front desk at night was exceptional nice when officially checked in. House keeping knocked on door day of check out at 8:46am. Not good. Noisy pipes and draines. I stay at a lot of hotels and this place is loud with early with flushing| showers etc. loved the shuttle| cookies and staff very nice. Too many options wouldn't stay again.,0
Weather  was very cold when we stayed . just a suggestion for the driving staff I think they should let people aboard  the bus instead of having them waiting until is time to leave.,1
Little noisy because helicopter landing for hospital across the street.,1
It's a perfect location and has a shuttle for Disneyland every day. The rooms are nice and big. You just need to keep in mind you pay for parking every day but the shuttle is free.,1
Super helpful valet staff. Easy check in. Quiet.,1
hotel staff were nice and friendly. Shuttle buss to Disney was a nice bonus. Room was nice and clean. Only down fall is the parking fee $20. USD. :(,1
Nice hotel| shopping right next door and tons of restaurants right next door.  You can walk to the shopping and restaurants| you will not need a car.,1
Love the shuttle bus to and from Disneyland and close walking distance to the outlets,1
Nice hotel. Lobby bar. Decorated nicely for Christmas. Near Mall and Outlet.,1
Clean room| comfortable bed| nice staff. I basically got all I expected.,1
Clean and comfortable. Would stay here again. P.s. best chocolate chip walnut cookies ever.,1
Floors in the room were so dirty my socks were black,0
Our family vacation was a great experience because of the service double tree by Hilton Anaheim provided. We used the shuttlecock Disney land every day that was provided by double tree and the drivers of the shuttle where great| made the trip back and forth between the park and hotel a blast! Thank you double tree for the great service,1
When checking in the clerk seemed very new to her job and could have provided better service but overall it was a good stay. I loved the view of our room window. I would definitely stay here again.,1
Clean and spacious rooms with comfortable beds. Proximity to Disneyland great.,1
It would be nice if there room service was until midnight at least,1
great staff who were very accommodating. comfortable rooms,1
Hotel was great. Great locafion near an outlet mall and great places to eat.   Free shuttle to Disneyland.   Staff was super friendly and they give you a complimentary cookie.  So good.  Definitely plan to stay there again in the future,1
Had feather comforter replaced but replacement was not warm enough.,1
After booking room I called Double Tree and asked for refrigerator since it is not customary and I was told for an additional $10 a day we can have one so I agreed. When I had gotten to check in she said there were no notes in my account and that they didn't have any extras and that it is really $20 a day. Neeess to say I had to dump several bottles of breast milk down the drain,0
Shuttle drivers were so nice and the check in service staff were very informative and pleasant. Did not make me feel unwelcome or dumb for not knowing certain things lol.,1
The staff was amazing and valet was inexpensive.,1
I was expecting free parking as it says parking allover their website and during booking process. Instead of that i had to pay $10 per night.,1
The hotel was nice| the staff was really friendly and the shuttle to Disneyland was great. I didn't like that they charged for parking though.,1
very nice and friendly hotel.  Excellent customer service.,1
Very accommodating staff| beautiful views from our room| and shuttle service to Disneyland was comfortable and convenient!,1
Older facility that has been updated| is clean| comfortable and has great service!,1
I stayed at the DoubleTree-Orange while my brother underwent heart surgery across The City Road at UCI Hospital. The hotel staff was very attentive and professional. They found another room in the heavily-bookend hotel when I had to extend my stay by two days. I would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone staying in the area.,1
Our sincere thanks and gratitude to everyone we came in contact with there - FOH staff| concierge| house keeping| Bar/Wait staff| shuttle drivers etc - you made the difference for us.,1
Everything was great| nice hotel| excellent location| clean and service was great. Bed was not that comfortable and did not know thier was a parking charge.,1
Overall my experience was positive but I prefer breakfast included packages. I went ahead and purchased the buffet breakfast but was not impressed. Also the shuttle service to Disneyland was a nice feature but when I went to board the 11 am departure with my watch reading 11:01 it was gone.  I would guarantee that of the people riding  the shuttle at least half of them had watches or cellphones or other devices that showed a range of 1 to 3 minutes time difference-they really need to provide some sort of grace period to allow for this difference- maybe 3 minutes or so!,1
Hotel Staff promptly attended us| we were happy and satisfy with the spacious rooms for one night.  Very convenient to the amusement parks Disneyland and California Adventure and besides that to the Outlet stores.  Food places to eat.  We Enjoy!  Kudos!!!Thank you.,1
Really helpful front desk. Angel accommodated is really well during check in and check out as we are also carrying a baby. Mary was really helpful during the night time despite having many request. Jay at the concierge was really great helping us find tours and confirm with me about the shuttle. It would be better if the Disney shuttle can run every half hr and more bus during peak hours. Only issue is the there is no bus schedule from 11-2.,1
Clean property.  Bedding and room was also clean.  Really enjoyed the free Disneyland hotel shuttle.,1
Helpful and very competent staff. Well maintained| high quality room accomodations.,1
very nice hotel will stay again if I'm in the area!,1
Not so goid gor the disney exoerience. Grest for business. Meatings  or stays,1
Staff was very friendly| fast check-in close to the the interstate| and the cookies were wonderful,1
Hotel is great| Staff is Great. Only down side| next to hospital so I didn't get much sleep.,1
Walking distance to orange outlet..we loved it!!! The breakfast was really good. There was a power cut (the whole Anaheim city) in the morning we had to check out. We had to carry our suitcases from level 17 to the lobby. The receptionist offered if we need assistance though but we knew they were probably really busy.,1
Close to st Joseph hospital. Easy coming and going free self parking helpful staff. The only thing missing in the room was a small fridge.wonderful beds.if needs be I will stay at this hotel.,1
This hotel is near the freeway| stores and Outlets. The room is spacious and mattress is firm & very comfortable.The only thing that bothered us is the rooms are not soundproof well. When someone next door takes a shower| you can hear the water running very loud.,1
It was great! I wish the room has refrigerator but overall CONCIERGE employees was friendly| knowledgeable and gave us fantastic service.,1
Parking not included. Would not want to stay again.,0
I was surprised to know that I was going to be charged for parking my vehicle as a guest. This is the first time I've ever had to pay for parking as a hotel guest,0
Everything went great overall. Friendly and helpful staff.,1
It was a relaxing fun trip. Room was great!,1
i liked everything| it was nice relaxing and the staff was courteous,1
I have to say.. the bed and pillows were very comfy. Nice view of city lights and a complimentary breakfast buffet! All in all a very nice overnight stay,1
The only thing they could improve is the noise of the AC...beside side| awesome service| excellent breakfast| perfect location for so many main location to visit in OC| plenty of dining restaurants around,1
Nice hotel with free shuttle service to Disneyland| the only downside is no refrigerator in the room.,1
The service was Terrible! The front desk staff is very unprofessional| unwelcoming and rude. Specially James who works the night shift. He for sure needs some customer service training. When we spoke to the manager regarding his rude behavior all we got is he is known to do that. What kind of answer is that coming from someone in charge?! I will never stay here again and would not recommend anyone else to do so. Not accomadating at all to families with small children.,0
Very bad experience for checking. Very slow and not dympathic,1
We had a great location in DT Chicago.  The hotel was clean and so where the rooms.  The breakfast was okay‚Ä¶waffles| sausage| potatoes| variety of breads| fruit| coffee and juices.  It felt safe because we were 3 women there for The Banksy Exhibit.,1
Friendly staff (Miles) that offered suggestions for places to go.,1
A great place to stay! It's quiet| clean| everyone was friendly. Very close to the river walk and L trains. Would stay here again!,1
Good service,1
When we checked in the room was disgusting. We mentioned something to the front desk| but they had no other similar rooms available to move us to. They had the room cleaned the next morning| and it was still dirty. We ended our stay a day early because elf the room being gross. When I called the front desk| I spoke to the manager| who was rude about our complaints. They did comp one night| but only after I had to ask for it.,0
The location is great in downtown Chicago!,1
I love the Art Deco features and the level of privacy. Staff is always accommodating and pleasant; we had a few issues and each was fixed immediately. The bed was not very comfortable| however| and the thermostat was set at 68 degrees| but the room got very warm overnight. I would definitely stay again at this Hampton Inn!,1
Didn't like the off site parking| price| location| facility.  Very inconvenience.,0
The filters of AC could be cleaned more ofen,1
Great location near tourist spots| one block to river walk.  Hotel has historic interest.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  Rooms are extremely small. The property has been remodeled but the upgrades were low quality.  Our wallpaper was buckling and dirty in places.  Very loud traffic noise.  It's a great location| the staff is great but the property hasn't been kept up well.,1
Jamal was very friendly and helpful with getting to parking. QR code for parking at hotel. Great hot breakfast. Simple gym| but has what you need for morning workout. Good central location.,1
Friendly staff. Clean and comfortable room. Great location. I'll stay here again.,1
What I liked about the property was its central location to everything. What I didn't like was the prices you have to pay for parking.,1
Everything was good Also the location was next to everything you want to go,1
Room was too small and hardly any space to move around even though we had a King bed. No valet or on-site parking but the hotel has off-site parking at a public parking which was a block away and there is a discount for hotel customers. Parking costs $43/night with ticket validation. Location was fantastic right in the heart of the city walkable distance to many restaurants| bars| shopping| river| etc.,1
The Hotel location is amazing. The room was clean and comfortable.,1
Excellent location! In the perfect spot to walk to the parks| the Riverwalk| Magnificent Mile...and close to bus stops to go to everything else! Room was great| bed was comfy...and they have even started breakfast again. Off site parking was just a block away so not a long walk. Staff was always super-helpful for this first-time Chicago visitor. Highly recommend and will stay here again for sure!,1
There was no a/c in rm#302. The desk (Ashley) had a problem understanding our names| Mr.May & Mr. Cargill| two resv. For two days| I don't know why that was difficult. Then we paid for parking and she put the wrong dates on qr code so we had to take a ticket to get in garage.when we told her the error she did NOT believe it until showed |then didn't know why she made a mistake.she told us the day mgr. would fix it .I ended up paying again to get my car out.I brought the Cargills from Houston to enjoy Chicago sites. I will never use your hotel again !Carl May (847)857-1605,0
Friendly staff. Clean rooms and good breakfast!,1
The staff needs to be a little more familiar with the off site parking garage. I asked several questions and several of the staff didn't know the answers too. If you don't have on-site or valet the staff needs to be knowledgeable.,1
GREAT value for downtown.  Excellent location.  Clean and spacious room.  Good breakfast. Don't hesitate.,1
Great walking distance to everything!,1
Comfortable room and bed| good continental breakfast. Valet wasn't available and parking was expensive. Otherwise great stay!,1
Location location location.  Good value| good service| helpful staff.  Other than typical city noises when trying to sleep and construction noise next door had a great stay.,1
The Hampton Inn Downtown was a great hotel in the perfect location.  As the former Motor Club of Chicago| the building provides a beautiful art-deco lobby from the 1920's.  The breakfast was excellent and the proximity to the CTA red line train was only about 2 to 3 blocks.  We could not have been happier with our choice in a Chicago hotel.,1
This place is exve,1
Beautiful lobby area and friendly staff.  Rooms were clean and updated.,1
Excellent service very friendly and helpful people in the front desk,1
The room is in good condition and had nice bedding| but the room (or the carpet) smelled like pee,0
The history inside the hotel is very interesting| being the Chicago Motor Club theme. I love the lobby! The continental breakfast the same every morning - a prepackaged bagel| yogurt| hardboiled eggs.  I wish they would provide more variety. We ended up eating out for breakfast one morning to get a break from it. They also did not provide cleaning service unless asked for. We had to request towels several times. The room was also extremely small| which for us was fine but maybe not for other people.  Overall| it was a pleasant stay other than the breakfast and lack of cleaning service.,1
This hotel is only a block from the River Walk area. The room was on the small side with no view| but we were rarely in the room| so that was fine. Parking is expensive and a couple of blocks away| so we never even used our car. There's a Hop On Hop Off pickup spot very close by and there's a 7-11 across the street. There are several restaurants in the area too. Staff was very friendly. Nice stay!,1
Upon checking in I was told I was in the wrong hotel. Front desk attendant told me to go next door. After returning to the hotel again and she checked us in. She gave us our room keys which did not operate because apparently the room was already occupied. She did offer an upgraded room which apparently our party of 4 cannot use given we needed double beds. She then offered a $50 refund for the inconvenience. As we got to our room we did not have any complimentary bottles of water. We tried to call front desk and it kept ringing for about 5 mins straight? Still no pickup. Ended up going down to front desk. When asking for it at the front desk a different lady told us we should have received it upon check in and we can only have 2 and she told us they were low with an unpleasant tone.,0
Our check in was chaotic. We didn't know the system and with all our luggage and a car that had to be moved quickly to a place we couldn't find| it was fairly stressful. I wish I had been sent instructions prior to my stay about what the parking was. The only clue I had were the reviews. The young man at the counter was friendly and gave good instructions but due to the stress and time crunch| I didn't remember it.,0
Excellent location near many restaurants and attractions,1
We have stayed at this property multiple times and always enjoy it. It is in an excellent location. Easy to walk to so many great places nearby or local CTA stops to get a little further out if need be. The rooms are clean as well.,1
Great location to walk around the downtown areas and close to the CTA and Metro train systems.,1
I loved the location. It was near everything we wanted to do. It was great to stay somewhere with history behind it such as the motor company. The only bad thing was that their was construction nearby. But I know Hilton has no control over that. Due to COVID breakfast wasn't served and no indoor pool. We're the only downsides. Other that that rooms and building were great.,1
The price wasn't too bad for the area.,1
Staff was amazing & very helpful. Location is amazing. Central to all the big attractions. Hotel & rooms were beautiful. Doubles are cozy| but definitely comfortable. Parking is a short hike| but there's an unloading zone in front of the hotel for checking in. Not doing a hot breakfast due to covid. Bar is also closed due to covid| which was a letdown.  The only complaint is there is construction right next to the building| & the curtains in the room don't close| so our room was illuminated at night from the lights. Otherwise| I'd definitely stay again,1
Super friendly and helpful staff| good location.,1
It's location and the parking deal they had with one of the garages,1
My little family st,1
Clean| safe and the staff was friendly,1
Location was perfect. The nice woman that checked us in was so kind and went above what I expected.  The hotel was advertising for drinks they did not have at the bar such as their draft beers| but we found other places with such great views.  My son and I had a great time large in part to the great hotel we were able to get around,1
The Staff were extremely nice and helpful. The cover on my daughters bed was stained. When we pulled off the sheets| there were crumbs of some nature on the mattress pad| which looked like it had not been changed in a long time. We found a smoking device on the floor. BEWARE the city is under construction. This hotel is right next to a major overhaul starting before day break. They are right outside your window and can see inside your room easily. The hotel parking is a block away. You have to cross over a major roadway to get to your parking. It looks scary at first but seriously| you will be fine.,0
Room was dirty and AC unit and lavatory were noisy all night long.  Also major construction project going on right next to this hotels so be advised.,0
Location is the best of all everything is near by and its close to all the main attractions.,1
It is not the Waldorf... but it is clean| the beds are comfortable good location| the staff was very nice and the rate was greatWhat else do you need?,1
I did not like that there was no option to rent movies.  There were no smart TVs| where we could log into Netflix or something to watch movies.  Also| I didn't receive the parking discount| because the app was not working properly.,1
I loved the staff. They were really really nice and helpful. The parking was a nightmare and I was disappointed that the breakfast was a sack and not hot/a big variety.,1
Everything was great! No problems at all except for a smell that I smelled a couple times but couldn't find where it was coming from!,1
Very good location| but because of a lot of construction along downtown we had a hard time looking for the hotel at first. Staff was helpful and room is clean. Satisfied with our stay.,1
Toilet kept getting stopped up| Room was cold all night Until they came & fixed it In the morning. Tv wouldn't go up past 50üòí parking was $43 for 24 hours i guess that was ok,0
Excellent service from all front-desk (interacted with three) personnel. The room was clean| and the beds were very comfortable. Having access to a printer in their business center was very helpful. All safety and hygiene practices were in place. The location is excellent. I shall stay here again.  Thank you!,1
Great location and view!!!!  Staff was awesome and the place was clean and comfortable.,1
I liked the high ceilings in my room| and the glass door shower. I did not like the location of the parking garage...being from a different state and not having clear directions on how to navigate from the garage to the hotel on foot was frustrating on our first night.,1
The location made it so convenient to get around the area everyone was soooo nice!,1
Clean nice rooms/bathrooms reasonable price workers are so sweet n understandable,1
Lobby was beautiful but rooms were so cramped up. Bathroom door didn't have a knob just sliding door. And didn't even give water bottle with breakfast. Wouldn't rent again,0
I came into town with my husband for a quick business trip and were very happy with our stay. The front desk associates were so helpful with finding restaurants after we checked in and gave great directions to the parking (one block away). The king bed did take up most of the room and it took a couple tries to figure out the thermostat| but it was very comfortable and a super convenient location! Breakfast we pretty limited due to COVID| but appreciated the effort. I have a gluten and dairy intolerance| so I wasn't able to eat it (which is normal| unfortunately). But I came prepared with my own bagels in the hopes that I'd have access to a toaster. The front desk attendant searched all over for a toaster| but couldn't track one down. Again| fully appreciate the effort! All in all| I'd happily stay here again| and plan to!,1
I was a date night with my wife of 17yrs. She enjoyed the peace and quiet of the hotel overall.,1
This Hotel  is so nice and clean.  The staff is very nice. I definitely will be back. Shawna was really great. Shes so nice.,1
Paid parking was very close by it was bit pricey $42,1
The front desk person was amazing and really helpful..,1
Beautiful Propety. Day and evening staff needs training on customer service. No nice greeting| staff seemed upset and irritated with customers. Night staff was wonderful.,1
It was nice. Everything was so close by.,1
The hotel was very clean and comfortable..the staff was wonderful,1
Great location! We had about 5 days in Chicago and only used public transportation once (to visit the Field Museum - too lazy to walk there :) but it's trully possible if you'd like - 25 mins away) - everything else we wanted to visit was 15-20 minutes walk - Sky Deck| Navy Pier| Millennium Park (Cloud Gate aka Bob)| Chicago River and so on. Room was comfortable| lobby - very beautiful. This building is old Chicago Car Club| and hotel keeps all possible sings of it - that amazing!,1
No housekeeping late check out I paid the parking never works,0
Clean hotel. Smelled clean in the room. Only thing I didn't like was no ice bucket in the room or cups. Therefore you have to request these items at front desk. Staff was friendly and accommodating.,1
The staff were very helpful with our checking in| and with getting our refund when we shortened our stay. The only disappointments were things unavoidable because of the pandemic.,1
I thought the hotel was nice and clean. The front desk was very nice and helpful. The only problem I had was with the thermostat which would work and then stop working. After a couple of hours I was offered another room but that meant packing up everything and wiping down a whole new room.,1
I loveeeeee the Hampton Inn! ALWAYS A PLEASURE! Keep up the awesome work!,1
The hotel location is so convenient| walking distance to every where downtown.,1
The room smelled HORRIBLE. I asked for toilet papers and towels and never received them. The parking situation was horrible also| the pass i paid $42 for didn't work and i had to go through hell and back to get my car back. The continental breakfast they offered was a bottle of water and an apple. She told me i could grab 1 even though i booked a room for 4 people.,0
Everything in one area it's a lot of cops down there 5 minutes from the river front.,1
The front desk was very friendly and helpful but the rooms are extremely small and the beds are not queen size as stated on the website they're full size. Also my room smelled like corn chips and I'm not sure but it was awful. The room doesn't have a microwave.,0
Staff was amazing| street noise was extremely loud| woke up multiple times every night from noise coming through the shut windows,1
All white shower.   Saw a couple black hairs.   I'm blonde.   Some small blood stains on white comforter.,1
Really nice hotel. Room was clean. smaller room than expected but other than that it was fine.,1
The decor was very cool| it has a lot of character and very cool vibe.  We received excellent customer service from the hotel manager.,1
Amazing Service| Staff is so Friendly specially Ruben| the room was amazing and spacious,1
People sleep in the hallway of the hotel refrigerator not cold and hot water not hot,0
This hotel was really clean and hotel management was perfect. Location was great to many attractions. The rooms are small but that was fine because it was only two of us. It was a great stay and I would definitely book again.,1
Given everything that is going on with the pandemic|  our stay was amazing!  Great location and easy to get to.,1
Traveling from Michigan got to Chicago early and was able to check in early.  Friendly staff| room was nice and clean. Hotel is in great location for shopping and sight seeing.,1
Great room| great price| and in a prime location.,1
The front desk employees were very nice and polite. Excellent location. The room a little small. The big problem was that the air conditioning was not working properly üôÅ,1
I didn't like after asking for towels each day i never got enough only one long body towel an one floor towel,0
I was not treated right and hotels.com didn't offer any from of accountability or accommodation.,0
Air conditioning with noise and not working in one of the two rooms I got.  They didn't fix it.  Bad breakfast.  Without sympathy and attention to reception.  I anticipated two days of reservation and left because of the lack of structure for the Coronavirus fetus.  I would like to be reimbursed for these two unused nights| indivisible as for Indianapolis (it would be next but I also had to cancel).,0
Clean bedroom. Breakfast was great. Staff weas very nice. Very close to everything.,1
Great location! This location was super close to most tourist attractions. The staff was super friendly and the rooms were clean!,1
very good hotel| nice people| good breakfast buffet| good service.Excellent customer service.,1
I like the fact this building was built in the 1928 before the great depression take place. And the person at the front desk was very helpful gentleman. I hope to book this hotel again next year.,1
"at the ""center of the bulleye"" for Illinois Place/top of The Loop/base of River North| very convenient to ""nexus"" of ""ELevated""/subway and river taxi.  architecturally interesting flourishes;  helpful front desk;  a better than expected breakfast| guest business office;  comfortable rooms;  noise of Michigan Avenue two blocks away can be muted by ""comp'd"" earplugs.  very nice place which I would term ""extraordinary value"".",1
I was really impressed with the quality of the room for the price. It was decent sized| very clean| amazing location| and very reasonable priced.,1
On day one upon entry to our room we found dirty comforters and sheets on made beds.  The cleaning staff did not clean our room on our second day until we told them to do so which was after 5:30pm.  Also| the staff was not very friendly or helpful during our stay.,0
The noise level at this hotel is beyond loud!!!! It is right next to a very busy fire station and also a bunch of night clubs. If that wasn't enough the walls are so thin that you can hear the neighbors crystal clear. When you check in they actually give you ear plugs. Also| the breakfast food items were not fresh.,0
Great location| comfortable and clean room| excellent breakfast (especially the eggs with ham! freshly cooked with real eggs),1
Very clean hotel and friendly staff. Will stay again!,1
Loved the look of elegance with the Art Deco feel| the breakfast had good variety for the week I stayed| and prepared so easily obtained| with a complimentary newspaper to read| good touchThe elevator creaked and scared me at first| I am forgetting this is building is aged at the 100 year mark| and I may be creaking too at that age.. Nice staff| and pleasurable experience,1
Great hotel in historic art deco building on Wacker and Michigan.  Really nice breakfast included and coffee available all the time in lobby.  Room was good size| extremely clean| well appointed and comfortable. Has all the standard amenities like workout room and business center.,1
Location| breakfast was excellent| like new | great hotel,1
Location| breakfast was great | clean | room like new | nice staff,1
This hotel was wonderful!  Close to many attractions within walking distance| free breakfast that was tasty| friendly staff| and comfortable room!,1
Price and rates were pretty much in my budget .front desk service was very helpful,1
There was a desk clerk named Drew and from the time we arrived he made my wife and I stay enjoyable. Our plane arrived early and naturally we wanted to get to the hotel as quick as possible to drop our luggage off and grab a bite. Knowing we were super early to the hotel we knew that check in would be slim. Upon arrival Drew greeted my wife and I asked about our flight and we explained everything went well and arrived early to drop everything off to grab a bite and explore the city. Drew said our room was ready for check in and invited us to have breakfast in the lobby. He gave recommendations to local restaurants and site tours (skydeck) which was really helpful and appreciated. Along with the other staff at night and the following days the entire stay was enjoyable and definitely recommend staying at this hotel again.,1
Close to train station and other venues.   Inexoensivd.,1
Great stay. Not fancy| not luxurious| but cozy and clean. Free coffee any time in the lobby| microwave in the lobby| waffles in the breakfast. Good localization| great staff. The air conditioner has a weird noise| we tried to change the room| but the noise was the same in both rooms. I don't think there is a better cost-benefit in the downtown area.,1
Great hotel in the historic Chicago Auto Club building. Fantastic location. Clean| comfortable. Friendly| helpful staff. Decent breakfast - hot entree| sides| waffles| pastries| fruit| yogurt.I'd definitely stay here again.,1
Great and helpful staff.  Good bargain in great location.  One improvement could be height of shower head in bathroom.  Too high to reach and previous guest had it set to blast.  Was a challenge to get it changed.,1
location location location! What a great spot in between every where we wanted to check out. Nothing was more then a 20+ min walk. Or we hopped rt on the bus or train which was also conveniently near by.,1
Room needed a deep clean but wasn't rough enough for me to complain about it. Just not up to most hotel standards. Building was secure| staff were friendly and helpful| breakfast hit the spot| and the location if perfect for someone visiting. Just blocks from Millennium Park| transit stations just a nice walk away. Overall this hotel is worth it for the price!,1
We had an ADA corner room - just enough space for us and it was quite clean. The hotel stafff we're all very nice| and the breakfast was delicious. Location is perfect in the cold weather. We would definitely stay there again.,1
Excellent value for the price. Clean and modern rooms. Only Breakaway choices and quality could be better,1
I love the location. The staff went above and beyond to fulfill a need for us.,1
Didn't like soundproofing of windows(heard each ambulance passing by). Breakfast was enjoyable. Friendly Staff. Good location.,1
Our room was up to date and clean. However| our only complaints were that it was tiny| had no view| and most of all there were loud banging noises in the pipes throughout the night. I am guessing it's due to being an old building. We didn't pay much to stay there and it was good for what we paid. It was in a great location.,1
Closer to activities.  Friendly staff| good breakfast,1
Bed are so comfortable super clean! Staff is amazing breakfast is so good ! Very quiet nice for a family,1
The location of the property was good. It was accessible to many of the popular sites and public transportation. We were surprised  to find that there weren't any dresser drawers in the room. We thought that is a standard so we had to leave out of our suitcase during our stay. You can hear street noise from our room. There are also construction right next to the hotel which of course the hotel has no control over. The staff was very courteous. The hotel kept our luggage after we checked out since our flight was later and we wanted to explore more.,1
Great location.  Rooms were clean and comfortable.  Hotel was quiet| which is great given the downtown location.,1
Historic building is actually on the acrchitecture tour.  Rooms are very small and crowded but you can beat the price and location.  In the middle of everyting!,1
Good service| Excellent food at breakfast|  clean and friendly staff,1
I liked the interior design. The bathroom was a bit small and the 2 shelves in the shower were tiny.,1
The atmosphere of the hotel in the morning would be markedly improved if the TV news was shut off| or put a small screen in a corner.  With the news blaring thru the 2-story lobby with hard acoustics is not a nice place for breakfast.  It's an art deco building| why not play 20s/30s soft swing to complete the setting.  But especially at 6am| and I was the only one| besides the desk clerk| it is a grim sounding space with the TV news in the background. More like an airport terminal.,1
I especially like the location.  Getting around the city was easy.,1
Great location.  Staff was very accommodating.  Free breakfast had hot items and was delicious.Only negative was that the lobby bar was only open from 4-10p.,1
I like the location of the property.,1
location was close to everything and good walking.,1
The room was small. Lighting was poor. there was no overhead lamp or reading lights.The fan| even at the slowest speed was too strong| making the room a little chilly.,1
Great location| great historic building (Former AAA headquarters)| and very nice renovations. Drew and his staff were amazing. When my wife and I return to Chicago| will be back.,1
Very central| reasonable rooms| average breakfast|,1
Great location and historic property.  Chicago architecture and nostalgia.,1
The property is great. There is a building being taken down beside it so sometimes some noise form that but not bad,1
Great location| service| cleanliness.  Only negative thing was room didn't have a safe.  Definitely would stay there again.,1
Great hotel in Chicago! Hotel was centrally located so we could walk to many spots. Hotel is very nice and I loved the automobile themed decor. Uber & Taxis was easy to use at this location. Enjoyed having a cocktail at hotel bar after a day of walking/touring. Breakfast in the AM helped us get an early start to our day. Definitely stay here again when I return to Chicago.,1
Perfect location. 2 min from everything. Rooms were clean and staff very friendly,1
The different breakfast options were commendable. However| waiting 2 days for extra towels was unacceptable. Also| the wait time to check out and check in was not appreciated.,0
Hotel was fully booked when we got there. We had already paid for it| they then took us to a different hotel.,0
Great front desk.  Nice clean room on 15th floor.  Close to the millennium mile| shopping and food.  Breakfast was the best I've ever had in a hotel.,1
Location near restaurants| public transport and attractions,1
Location was amazing and easy to get to everything in Chicago,1
Close to all attractions and public transit.  Bathroom was dirty when we arrived.,1
The property was located in a very good location. The breakfast buffet and coffee were great.My only complaint is there was a musky smell in my room.,1
Overall| very good but had to request the room to be made up one day as it was skipped.,1
Great location| friendly & helpful staffParking is an expensive proposition,1
Location and price was good.  Need to fully stock the concession area so guests can avoid leaving the hotel for basics like soda.,1
good place ill be back next time| good breakfast| nice people| room super clean,1
The bed was so comfortable.  The room was clean| the bath water was very hot. It was great. The employees were all friendly and engaging. They were helpful in getting us around. I would definitely stay here whenever I am in town.,1
Spent one night here to catch the train from Millenium Station in the morning. The hotel was in a great location. The highlight of our stay was the comfy bed and the continental breakfast. Never knew a hotel to offer various fresh squeezed juices and smoothies! Would recommend staying here.,1
Nice hotel. Helpful staff. Good breakfast bar. Good location. Near many attractions and public transport.,1
I hate to say I wouldn't recommend to anyone. Kind of the downer of our otherwise great trip.,0
We had a really nice stay! The breakfast was great and changed on a daily basis so they never served the same hot food. We were there for 5 days. The location was great. The only complaint I would have is that we stayed on the 14th floor| which I was absolutely fine with| but this meant they did not come to clean the room until the end of the day which was annoying. We would leave by say 9am and come back at 4-6pm and the room would still not be cleaned! Also| in the room| there was a huge pillar that took up a significant amount of the room which was irritating as well. If you do stay here and stay on one of the higher floors| call the desk when you leave for the day so they don't come around 7:45 pm to clean your room and then do a crap job because they are upset even though it was them who completely forgot (and then they accused me of leaving the sign on the door - which I did not do!).,1
Wonderful location| very friendly staff| slightly older facility in fairly good repair. Breakfast was excellent.,1
The location was perfect! Steps away from Michigan Avenue & many| many sights. I would just say the room was pretty tight. Probably better with a queen sized bed instead of a king. This would give a bit more space. The bathroom was updated & modernized| but no soap! When we asked for some| we were provided with one bar only! You need two ‚Äî- one for the sink & one for the shower! Housekeeping also threw out my shower cap I had left on the counter to dry. The desk staff was excellent. I still enjoyed my stay.,1
The staff was super friendly and helpful. The bed was great! And the breakfast was delicious!,1
Was not able to check in until 5pm| an hour after check-in time.,0
Some of the staff at the front desk just appeared lazy and didn't want to get things taken care of right away.,1
The room had a stinky aroma| the tables at the lobby  all sticky from the syrup.  With that said| the service was wonderful| the people who work there very friendly and helpful.,1
The only difficult part was getting to hotel because our GPS would lose signal went we went under the,1
For me| the location is perfect| close to most everything you want to do while in the city of Chicago- most attractions are in walking distance.,1
My stay in Chicago in this hotel is totally satisfying. Comfortable stay in a prime city location has been a key takeaway. The room was a tad smaller for my family but comfortable. Very courteous staff and a nice| filling breakfast added to my satisfaction. I would recommend this hotel to anyone on a visit to the great city| personal or on business. I would love to come back and stay with them again!,1
Excellent location| near lots of good restaurants| theater| museums.  Room had fridge| wifi| coffeemaker.  Breakfast buffet is included with the room but it's not very good| so don't get your hopes up.  Staff are super friendly and helpful.,1
It was better than the Sheraton grand.,1
Good location clean room included breakfast very nice !,1
Staff extremely friendly! Specially Drew from the front desk! Room is a bit small and parking price is very high. Overall is a great hotel and very well located.,1
Staff was great and it's in a great location.   But| parking is a bit of a headache... and pricey.,1
Our room was directly above an exit from the underground roadway. At night cars and motorcycles clearly use it as a raceway. This was very loud. We were also above the trash cans so 6am trash trucks were our wake up call. By the third night we were use to it. The hotel is very clean| the free breakfast was good and a great money saver. The beds are nice| pillows are ok and they brought us a requested extra blanket quickly. The staff was helpful and friendly. Overall decent stay for a budget.,1
The location was good. Right in the middle of downtown. It was easy to visit and see a lot from Chicago and it was close to the lake. The staff was friendly too,1
This Hotel was great|  the Staff was very nice and very accomodating.  Johnny in particular went above and beyond for us| making our dinner reservations while we were out exploring the city.  We will definite stay here again the next time we visit the Windy City!,1
Nothing special I got stuck and no help for 20 minutes,0
Great! Convenient location| great breakfast| kind staff.,1
Great hotel in a wonderful location! I would definitely stay here again!,1
This hotel has the perfect location if you want to be in the middle of the action in Chicago...only few blocks away of Millennium Park| bus stops| and the train. We stayed there for 6 nights and we were really pleased. I would've given a better review if it's not because the breakfast is not great| we had breakfast included but we ended up eating out 3 days. If you don't mind to have a very simple breakfast you will be fine. I read all the reviews before booking and some people complained  about the noise| so I requested a room in the higher floors| we were on the 7th floor and I could still hear the street noise (like garbage trucks or something). After the first night it didn't bother me that much| just be mindful of the perks to be in the middle of Chicago.,1
Everything about this hotel is great| expect| the size of the room.  We were a little disappointed with the room size| but it worked out.  The location is within walking distance of everything you would want to see in downtown Chicago.  We'd definitely stay again.,1
Great location.    Bar closed to early,1
We were traveling with a tired toddler waiting to be checked in.. We requested if early check in is possible| they said they will try. Since 4pm we kept going to the reception asking if room was ready and they said the cleaning dept hadn't reported it yet. It was almost at 4:45 that we go checked in. And even at that time I went with a sleeping toddler on my shoulder asking about it. They didn't even us call us when the room was ready. Coming to the room| it was non smoking but we clearly could smell smoke from the room door. Very disappointed| especially staying with a toddler.,0
The staff was very friendly and helpful,1
I loved staying here! Check in and check out went smoothly. The room was perfect for us.,1
We were very happy with our stay here. The room was clean and and the complimentary breakfast was excellent!,1
Beautiful building| comfortable room|   great location| staff super friendly and helpful| free breakfast,1
"This property is outstanding! Located in a historic building| within easy walking distance of Michigan Avenue| we easily walked to the American Girl Doll Store and quickly ""ubered"" everywhere else on our agenda. The staff was outstanding - especially the breakfast staff! So helpful! This is our second time at this property and I would stay again and again!",1
In Chicago to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary.   Have stayed at Hampton Inns| and feel they are very reliable and a good bargain.  A nice buffet breakfast was included which was a nice way to start the day.  All the staff was very friendly and helpful.  The hotel is located in great area close to many restaurants| shopping| theater district| and Michigan Ave.  Would stay again on our next visit to Chicago.,1
The hotel staff was very accommodating and the breakfast was very good both mornings. The cleaning staff needs to dedicate more time to each room though as our A/C unit had clearly not be cleaned in months| which is an issue for guests with allergies or asthma,1
Our room was not cleaned after first day but we did ask for clean towels and they were brought immediately,1
Great location| great staff| great breakfast| great service.,1
Drew at the front desk was exceptional!  The hotel is in a great location but the room was super small.,1
Well situated in the heart of the Loop.The main negative to this property is plastic cutlery and paper plates are used for breakfast. This is unacceptable for this level of hotel !,1
It was ok. It was a late check in and I loved that it went smoothly.,1
Room faced alley which was extremely noisy.  Had to change room at midnight due to loud noise.  Staff was accommodating.,1
Flexible staff that did a great job of accommodating me on my early arrival. I called from Blue Line and when I got the at 1000a they had a room for me.  Great extra effort that you don't always fine.  Will to stay there again,1
Everything was perfect,1
Great location! Confortable hotel in downtown Chicago!,1
Great hotel. Wonderful service| loved the area and complimentary breakfast!,1
"I had the room on the 15th (top) floor.  Ceiling was high| giving a very spacious feel.  Lobby area included a bar and small convenience ""store"".  Breakfast included omelet| waffles| cereal| fruits| etc.  Overall very nice hotel.",1
Breakfast was included and it was perfect with plenty of choices| the staff was very friendly| and the location is superb. Great for the value.,1
Location was great| lots of attractions within walking distance.  Staff was so friendly and welcoming!  Breakfast was very nice with a good variety.  Would absolutely stay again!,1
great location and breakfast was good. They had a nice waffle machine,1
Loved the Art Deco look of the room. Employees were super friendly.,1
Stayed for St. Patricks day weekend.  Clean hotel. Close to everything we needed.,1
The room was very clean with a great view of the river. We watched the river dyeing (on St. paddy's day) right from our room. The front staff was very generous| they even held our luggage after checkout while we were having fun.,1
Amazing stay for one night. Comfy bed| location was awesome...walkable distance to the Millennium park| Chicago River| and other stores I found interesting to shop.,1
Nice hotel clean and not complaints we enjoyed closer to almost all attractions and museums I will stay here again without hesitation,1
Excellent service. Beautiful facility. Expensive valet parking though.,1
Very nice and welcoming staff.,1
Nice hotel in a great location near the river. Reasonable walk to many sites on Michigan Ave. and the surrounding area. Came during college spring break with my daughter|  but will definitely return during warmer weather. Would also choose this hotel again. The staff was friendly and accommodating (held our bags before and after check-in)| the breakfast options were tasty and fresh and hotel was clean.,1
I lived that it had this boutique hotel feel. The staff was extremely helpful and courteous. The rooms were small| but very chic and clean. The only negative was that you could hear the traffic really loudly outside| even in the 14tf floor.,1
I was told that the credit card I used to reserve the room was not valid and my room was given to someone else| I was told that they called me but didn't leave a message...I got a room next door from Hampton inn and paid for it with the same credit card no problem... How do you explain that? I think they over book the rooms and then use this excuse to manage their mess ups... Not coming back..,0
No exhaust fan in bathroom| no microwave| room was tiny,1
Love the rooms|views of downtown|great breakfasts|and especially love the friendly staff.,1
Very friendly when I was in a hurry to check in| drop my bags| and run out to a business meeting.,1
Lovely historic building updated with modern comforts. The free breakfast was nice to have| and the hotel was walking distance to most places we wanted to go and just a couple blocks from the trains. I used the fitness center| which was okay. The machines aren't very sturdy| but at least there is a place to work out. Rooms are small but the layout is very functional and makes it feel larger than it looks. The front desk and valet staff were friendly and always helpful. They will hold your luggage behind the desk| which was helpful on our last day since we had a late departure. I would stay here again.,1
Excellent location| friendly staff| very clean| good breakfast| low price.,1
It seemed more like it was a business type hotel.  It was clean| reasonably comfortable| and the breakfast was pretty good (good sausage patties the first day| but blah eggs in an omlet| and the second day the scrambled eggs were good| but horrid turkey sausage links).  The location is great (in fact| probably the best thing about it) for the River-walk and Millennium park| pretty close to the L and some other downtown landmarks.  I wasn't a fan of the room layout (with the TV way over on the side| as more of an afterthought).  I also didn't like that we had a separate door to go through to get to our room door (only a few rooms seemed to have this| but mine did| and I didn't really like it).  Overall| I'd give it a 4/5.  I'd be willing to stay here again (although I'd want a different room).,1
Great location and price for the room. Only negative is upon check out and driving away| we looked at the receipt for overnight parking was charged twice. Had to call front desk to correct the problem.,1
I like the view from the fourteen floor. I did not like the setup from the bed to the tv.,1
Great hotel and staff! Would stay here again! Hotel is located in the middle of everything. Walking distance to so many places!,1
Beautiful hotel. Excellent location. Beds were extremely comfortable!,1
I loved everything about this hotel it was awesome,1
Great location| friendly staff| clean| and comfortable beds.,1
Great location| nice clean rooms| fast elevators| good breakfast that is included| will stay here again.,1
No regular coffee in the hotel room,1
Great experience| the lobby is special| rooms are comfortable and well appointed. The location is perfect for visiting the heart of Chicago!,1
Location| service and cleanliness superb! I always book this particular hotel when I am in Chicago because it's the best!,1
Location was ideal| a half block from hubbub but close to all activities and destinations.,1
The lobby is beautiful. Rooms were very clean and spacious. Beds were comfortable. I felt very safe in this hotel. My only complaint was that they required that I give my credit card for $130 incidentals charge. This charge was not explained when I booked.,1
I've never had better customer service than at the Hampton Inn| Chicago! Everyone from the front desk| to the bartender| to the housekeepers were not only helpful be super friendly and kind. Will definitely stay here again! Great atmosphere| and just a couple blocks from riverwalk and theater district.,1
Service was great. Lobby is an art deco masterpiece. An architectural tour visited the lobby. Hotel was built as the Chicago Motor Club. Riverview room was as advertised. Breakfast was better than we expected. Location was superb. Would visit again| and would recommend to anyone| and it is worth a few dollars more to get the river view rooms.,1
Very nice and quiet hotel.  Easy and quick check-in.  Normally stay at the Palmer House but tried Hampton instead this time.  It is a quieter hotel with quick elevators (something the Palmer House does NOT have).  Definitely will stay there again,1
Great location in the downtown area. I would ask to face the river.,1
Wonderful location| very helpful front desk| breakfast varies every day| very clean room.,1
Nice hotel in downtown Chicago| walking distance to a lot of tourist attractions. Room was nice but rather small. There's not enough drawer space for clothes.,1
The carpet smelled like stinky feet. The bed mattress we could feel the springs. The breakfast was ok. A little slow to add more food for the guests.,1
We were stuck in Chicago when our flight was cancelled so wanted something reasonably priced and close to orange line which goes to Midway. Breakfast was great! It was comfy. Room smelled damp and we could not figure out AC/heating. You are paying for the extremely central location. Our first night was 237US and second 350US. 350 was too much but could not be bothered moving. Staff was great.,1
My only concern was the room temperature. Several adjustments were made but the room was still too cold. Had to sleep with extra clothing and comforters.,1
Staff was friendly and helpful and I liked the continental breakfast,1
Excellent location. Good upkeep of the hotel,1
Perfect proximity to the Riverwalk| Miracle Mile and Millennium Station - all within walking distance.  Hotel has a great desk staff (Shauna!!!!) and the breakfast buffet is pretty decent.,1
Great location.  Front desk staff is very helpful with directions. Good breakfast.,1
the staff were just wonderful...The breakfast was good|   the hotel was very clean .     You can't beat the location,1
Nice hotel close to everywhere we wanted to go. Staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful.,1
Great location| wonderful staff. The breakfast was typical free breakfast hotel fare| but free and varied.,1
Great room!   Beautiful old building!  Was not expecting river view| so we were delighted.  Great breakfast.  The location is wonderful......close to Millenium Park| Michigan Avenue| Riverwalk| access to Bug Bus| water taxis and Shoreline Cruises.,1
All went well with our small group's visit and the breakfast was very good.,1
Small boutique style hotel. Breakfast was included which was great.,1
Excellent location. Beautiful building. Good price. Helpful staff. I'll be back!,1
Staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was very nutritious| with many healthy choices.,1
Everything is perfect. The room is nice and clean.,1
Great location to stay at for downtown attractions! Spacious and well kept.,1
the late checkin is at 4 and the early checkout is at 11 that only leaves you 19 hours of stay per day| some hotels are implementing this rule in detriment of customers |||,1
I had a great experience room was very clean service was very professional I would love to come back,1
Great service. Breakfast was fantastic. The variety was surprising. Thank you,1
All fine Very good and confortable hotel!Regards.,1
Good location| very kind & friendly staff. Absolutely recommen danke.,1
Comfortable hotel.,1
I was pleasantly surprised at our short stay at LondonHouse. The staff were very pleasant.  You can reach them by text any time.  The location is great for outings on the Riverwalk and still a short walk to Michigan Avenue. The rooftop bar/dining had a gorgeous view of the Riverwalk and downtown and tasty drinks and tapas. The beds were comfortable and I really like the interior design approach of the interiors and rooms.,1
Great stay! Rooftop bar provides great views of the city!,1
Great hotel| wonderful views and centrally located.,1
Amazing hotel! Service was excellent| great location and beautiful rooftop bar.Will definitely stay here again when we come back to Chicago!!,1
It was really nice experience. Esepecially the location of the hotel was perfect. I highly recommend this one to tourist and I will stay again later.,1
Really nice hotel,1
The location is great and the staff service is excellent,1
The room lacked basics like tea bags.  I was not asked at check to have the room cleaned.  Except for Mark| the bell hop captain| service was not exemplary,0
The staff was very nice and attentive to our needs. We enjoyed the rooftop bar and our room was very comfortable with nice amenities. We will certainly stay at the London House  again. It's a very good value.,1
I liked the hotel room's cleanness and everything was nearly perfect. i stayed at room with river view| it was just amazing. i do not know other rooms will be perfect like one that I stayed for three nights but overall it was the most wonderful nights at hotel in my life.,1
Former Chicago local ‚Äî stayed here for a weekend and loved everything about it. Beautifully designed and very well kept. The hotel's location is perfect| right on the Chicago river and Michigan Ave| tons of food options and a super easy walk to all the popular attractions like the bean| Navy Pier| the art museum| river walk| etc. We loved the rooftop bar| great place to grab drinks and enjoy the excellent views of the river and most iconic buildings in the skyline (check out the pic I attached). The restaurant on 21 was great too| food was delicious| but the restaurant is inside and not many tables have views. Room was pristine ‚Äî looked like it had just been renovated| very clean and contemporary. Love the modern industrial feel. Will likely stay here again when I'm back in town.,1
"My husband and i had a very unusual and terrible experience at Londonhouse Chicago Hotel late at night around 12:15am. We got back to hotel and went to the lobby to grab 4bottles of water as everything around us were closed and we ran out of water. The guy name ""RICARDO"" at the front desk just refused to give us water bottles. He said he can only give us two because that's the ‚Äúso-called‚Äù rule of Hilton!! He kept arguing with us for continuously 10mins and still didn't give us water bottles. He said he will charge $5 for each bottles or else we can leave. Yes that came from a Hilton hotel!! Is this how hilton treat their hotel guests?? He was rude as hell and was adamant to not give us 2 freaking water bottles!! I have severe urine infection and needed water badly| i was suffering as i had to take medication. This is just ridiculous and unacceptable from hilton! I stayed at Hilton in other countries too| none of them were this bad. We travel the whole world but this is first time a hotel refused giving water bottles. NOT EVEN OUT OF HUMANITY?! I don't see any reason of his refusal and aggressive behavior other than we are brown (Bangladeshi) people| and clearly he's a racist I believe.I wouldn't have written all these for 2 freaking water bottles if it didn't get this bad. Just ridiculous!He could have denied us nicely| then we would just buy them. But no! He was very very rude!Other than that| they don't always receive calls at front desk.",0
Excellent Stay! Nicole at the front desk was excellent. We had previously stayed there in June. Came back for my 55th birthday it was so nice. And I will be back.,1
The stay itself was really nice| but there were a few things that made the trip a bit unpleasant. My mother and I ordered breakfast the night before to be brought up to our room| but even after the scheduled time| the food was nowhere to be found. There was also a problem with the wifi not working constantly. The room itself was clean and a wonderful place to come back to after a long day in the city. One other thing to mention is that there should have been more hooks in the bathroom for towels| robes| and washcloths.,1
This property was amazing the staff is great the convenience of restaurants being nearby is wonderful I would recommend this place and I surely would love to come visit again soon,1
Property was clean & staff was very attentive & responsive,1
Great location - in a beautiful historic building with modern amenities.  It's right in the city| though| so you can hear some street noise in the room at night - including sirens,1
We were very happy with the location.It would be nice if there were some drawers to unpack our clothing.,1
Phenomenal views and location.  Walking distance to lots of amazing restaurants | bars and shopping.All staff very friendly and courteous.  Super clean rooms and common areas.  Great amenities in the room.  No complaints‚Ä¶they thought of everything a guest needs.,1
Full of people| very crowded. Took forever to take the evelator,1
Staff did not try to accommodate us when our flight wasn't leaving till late afternoon refused to allow us an extra couple hours in room‚Ä¶. When we went to the the lobby so many concert goers using their facilities and restrooms?? I paid over 200 dollars a night and can't stay another two hours but kids can come all through the hotel to use bathrooms and take pics on stairway??!,1
It's a great location| nice price| and well-staffed and maintained.  The staff was always friendly.  My one complaint is that the elevator system is not good for the pandemic environment.  The floor selection buttons are on the floors by the elevators| not in the elevators. This creates pressure to get into the elevator the system says to even if there are 3 or 4 people already in it.  You can spend a lot of time redoing the process to avoid getting into a crowded elevator| or you can just get in.,1
Roof top bar was fun.  If you want a table reserve well in advance.  Weekend nights bit noisy outside but did not hurt experience.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  Just need to ask.,1
Loved the hotel. Beautiful experience start to finish,1
Very nice hotel and we were able to check in early! It is an great location| right on the river and near all of the tourists destinations. The elevator was interesting and sometimes would take a long time due to the amount of guests but overall enjoyed our time!,1
It is perfectly located for restaurants| water tours| shopping| Art Institute. Nice restaurant for breakfast and lunch. Staff was wonderful.  Rooms are well appointed and up-to-date.  It would have made it perfect if there had been a pool.,1
It has an amazing location in downtown| right on the river. We had a river view room and the view was just stunning! The decor and room size were great and loved the bed and bedding! Very nice gym also,1
The elevator was nice and useful,1
Love the location and rooftop restaurant.,1
I liked the gym| the room and most things but Reception said they couldn't book me an early morning taxi and I should contact Uber which I found to be very odd.,1
I would never stay here again.  For the money you pay| the service is terrible.  There is apparently a rooftop bar| but you cannot get anywhere near it because it's always full of non-hotel guests.  They make no accomodation for hotel guests to have acess.  When you walk into the building| you have to navigate around a sea of valet who don't actually do anything besides huddle in a group and complain about their employment.  God forbid you ask them to help with anything. To top it off| upon checking out| they have refused to give me a receipt.  They charged by credit card| sure.  But to find out what the charges are| they say I need to contact Expedia| wait on hold for hours| for Expedia to get a copy of my receipt.  Absolutely atrocious.,0
Excellent hotel stay. Beautiful room and view. Great location! We will definitely be make another visit to this location.,1
We absolutely loved our stay at the London House! The location was amazing! Everything we wanted to do was within a mile from the hotel. We loved how we were just steps away from the Riverwalk and located right by the magnificent mile!,1
Rooms were a little small,1
Wonderful stay. Room was perfect. Everyone very friendly and helpful. Had to wait far too long for elevators.,1
First the hotel never answered the phone for reservations.  Secondly the staff was some of the worst. We tried getting up to the rooftop and that was a nightmare as well.  Would I stay and pay what I did again? NO,0
Fabulous location & view,1
Loved priority access to the rooftop| super clean| great walkable location!,1
Was excited to book the hotel for the first time and have lunch on the rooftop.   Very cool/unique hotel| great being across the street from the Riverwalk.   The lunch was a bummer -- waitress forgot to put our order in until 45 minutes later and was completely unapologetic about it.  Disappointing.,1
Rooftop,1
The door next to ours made so much noise that we couldn't sleep all night. We were so tired and still couldn't sleep. When you're staying in nice hotel you don't expect such treatment. But we were so disappointed and so tired. I would not recommend this place to anyone and I will not stay there again.,0
Location| Location| Location!! And when my car didn't show up for the ride to the airport the guy at the front got me a van to take my family just in time to make our flight.  Great stay!!,1
Great hotel; perfect rooftop,1
Clean| Safe| Spacious rooms| employees clean friendly well spoken and helpful when/if needed,1
Great property| great location. The hotel staff was so pleasant,1
Excellent location to things to do and see in Chicago.,1
From check in to check out| everything was 5 stars!!,1
This is our third or fourth time staying at this property and found a change in clientele and behavior.  I think we did not enjoy it as much because people are finally coming out after the pandemic and a bit boisterous.,1
Everything Was great. My only hiccup was that there was no microwave in the room. Additionally they were not able to warm up any leftovers for us in the kitchen areas.,1
One of the best hotels in Chicago for sure! Perfectly situated in the middle of everything you want to do in the city. Gorgeous views of the river from the rooftop and some rooms. Highly recommend staying here.,1
Beautiful property in a great location!,1
House keeping did not ever clean and/ or straighten our room.  We did not even get clean towels once!,1
Great location| agree with others that rooms are a bit small but the quality and river view made up for that. Loved the rooftop bar. Suggest that bathroom needs towel hooks!,1
Went for the rooftop bar| was informed they do not allow standing room due to covid.,0
It's a great location in downtown. Hotel was good but city view means back of the building. River view is another $40 a night. I was not too happy about that. Room is clean and very nice. I might check out other properties next visit. All in all it's a good hotel.,1
Great time. Great hotel. Perfect customer service. Not quite priced right since there is no room service. But the overall experience was top notch.,1
The hotel was located perfectly in the mix of everything you come to Chicago and see. The hotel was absolutely beautiful and the rooms and views were one of a kind.,1
Wonderful rooms with spacious bathroom and multiple areas to get ready. The room was sparkling clean and the bed very comfortable.,1
Love this place!  It didn't disappoint.,1
The hotel was great and the location was excellent! For the price| you cannot beat it.. My only complaint is that house-keeping never entered our room during the 4 nights we stayed there. The bed was never made and the towels were never replaced.,1
The Londonhouse is my go to place to stay in Chicago. A little disappointed there's no room service but understandable considering COVID.,1
Great hotel and location,1
I didn't like that there wasn't any room service,1
For a hotel as reputed as Londonhouse basic amenity like TV was not working inspite of me call the room service 4 times. The shower cap was of a very low quality it tore as soon as I put it on. For the amount that I paid it was not at all worth.,0
Fabulous hotel with a great location. The hotel was about a quarter mile from the State/Lake transit stop| so it is super easy to get to. (The orange line from there takes you directly to the midway airport.) On one side| the hotel overlooks the river (we paid extra for the view| but it was worth it). The hotel is near a major thoroughfare| so you can hear some traffic noise like honking even on the higher floors. The hotel was very clean| and customer service was excellent. The hotel has three restaurants| a hotel bar and a cafe all in the same building| so food was always nearby. If you want to visit the rooftop bar| you must make a reservation| so we recommend booking your reservation in advance. Unfortunately| the timeslots were all booked while we were there. Free water is not provided (there are 2 Voss bottles for $5 each in your room)| so we recommend bringing some with you. We also ate at Ocean Prime in the hotel and it was AMAZING.,1
Beautiful hotel| super clean friendly staff,1
Original room AC was broken. The front desk said someone would be right up. After an hour and 2 more phone calls they brought us keys to a new room that ended up being much nicer than the room we had. Not sure why it took so long to just give us another room or that option. Felt lied to a little since they originally said someone was on the way. Real story was someone would be on the way After they went to 3 other rooms and fixed issues there. There is a club on the roof and that makes the lobby very crowded every night. Not a huge problem but people should be prepared. Check in is actually on the second floor and there is no signage or anything letting you know. You just have to figure that out on your own. It has the worst elevator system I ever saw. Be prepared to wait 10 minutes any time you need the elevator. Room was great. Location is great.,1
I had enjoyed my stay the staff was great all tho the to get into the rooftop bar is confusing as far as the app goes. Also the Valet parking phone doesn't work it goes straight to the voice mail. All and all it was great.,1
Great location. Beautiful hotel. Clean. Great staff. If you want to go to Rooftop to eat outside MAKE A RESERVATION prior to the day you want to go. This was not explained to us. You cannot make a same day reservation. Concierge will tell you you have preference to get seated that is not entirely true| they dont even do the bookings. You will wait for ALL reservations to be seated before they will take you up. We waited 1.5 hours to go up| just like the general public.,1
Location and Views,1
Location| location| location! Front Desk & Housekeeping were excellent! However|  Rooftop personnel were snobbish. Was told by the FD I could go anytime only to have the gatekeepers @ the RT say not the case. I love Chicago|  but NYC has better Rooftop views.,1
I don't even know where to be begin! This place was one of the best stays I've had and I really think it's because you feel like you're not even in Chicago! It doesn't even seem like it's a Hilton!,1
Everything was Awesome.. Rooms or beds could be better and reasonable parking prices,1
I enjoyed staying at the London House it was great!!!!,1
Spent a weekend at London house first thing I noticed walking in was how much space there was. Everyone was kind & helpful in fact the service was really good. Although the rooftop was booked I enjoyed my stay and recommend it to anyone. I have no complaints| will come again !,1
Awesome stay! Great location,1
This property's location is awesome| the view from the rooftop is amazing.  We got upgraded to the river view for half price and they didn't charge extra for early check in..I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone| all the staff members were super friendly and housekeeping was on par.,1
This was my favorite hotel I've stayed at ever. Beds and pillows were incredible| made it hard for me to get up in the morning. We had a river view which was gorgeous and location was walkable to so much. The rooftop bar was beautiful| but closed. I will be back in the summer!,1
I liked the customer service and the cleanliness of the hotel. NO complaints!,1
Beautiful hotel. My King corner suite was very stylish and comfortable. Definitely make reservations for the rooftop bar because it very popular.,1
Beautiful hotel| the shower shut off randomly but other than that we had a very nice weekend. Disappointed rooftop bar was closed| still went up for pictures. Also| no room service is available yet due to Covid,1
Amazing views and dinner at Prime!,1
We had such a great time staff was really nice hotel was beautiful and clean We loved how convenient it was to get to areas of downtown walking and/or Uber/lift. The only drawback was the rooftop didn't realize how quickly it booked usually about a month in advance We had just went to go upstairs and check it out and at the time it was closed due to weather So I would just keep it in mind if it's something you're looking forward to doing other than that no complaints,1
London House is a great hotel overall| very clean| friendly staff| couple restaurants within the property| and a beautiful rooftop bar. Now| the cherry on top is the location| is in the center of all the action.,1
It was my first time at this hotel| but it was perfect! Love it! And thank you for everything!‚ù§Ô∏è,1
The People at the main entrance are great.....,1
Very Covid clean! Wonderful staff- friendly and helpful. Convenient location.,1
Excellent stay.  Perfectly located to everything.   Rooftop restaurant was great.  Views were fantastic.,1
It was a very pleasant stay,1
The view was great| the room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable the roof top bar and restaurant was definitely a plus.,1
This was our first stay here.  The staff in general was awesome. Every single person we came across was curteous| helpful| and polite.  My wife and I rarely have time to do fun overnights| and the staff hooked us up with a gorgeous view of the river and we really appreciated that.  Rooms were modern| clean| and stellar.  Thank you LondonHouse staff!,1
The overall stay was wonderful. Upon arrival the valet were prompt to ask if you are checking-in. The staff were very courteous and helpful. They made me aware of the Covid guidelines and which services were not available. During my stay I noticed everyone was abiding by social distancing and mask wearing. The elevator were crowded and slow during the morning hours so you may want to calculate a few extra minutes into your schedule. Plan to stay again.,1
Beautiful atmosphere . The rooftop experience. The luxurious rooms. Central location.,1
Welcoming staff| perfect location to restaurants| shopping and views!!!,1
I loved the cleanliness the location of my room (studio corner) loved that everything was close. Staff was great. What I didn't like is that we were not warned about a $100 deposit per night but it's okay other than that everything was perfect. Loved that they have nespresso machines| I love that coffee| I have a machine at home| I didn't miss my morning coffee.,1
Beautiful hotel with gorgeous rooms. Perfect location and great staff.,1
Parking was expensive. Very nice hotel. Very clean| nice views| I wish they put the tv on in the lobby| and I wish they were serving drinks at the lobby bar.,1
Amazing views| great hotel and super nice employees. Definitely coming back!,1
Really enjoyed our stay at the London House. Located in a convenient place- close to restaurants and shops.,1
I hated that there was no parking for free. I wish the spa was free.,0
Beautiful hotel!  The restaurant attached is Ocean Prime and it was outstanding.,1
Hotel was absolutely beautiful! The beds are extremely comfortable and we had a really relaxing stay. My only complaint is that the elevators are really difficult. It took forever for us to get to our 10th floor room when everyone was heading up to the rooftop bar. Regardless| I would definitely stay there again!,1
My stay was excellent! The London House met my expectations of a downtown hotel.  The check-in was easy and the staff was pleasant. I was also very impressed with the covid precautions that were in place. My room was beautiful with the views topping off the experience!,1
Nice place but only my concern that valet parking is extra expensive it's 72 dollars I have to park in self parking 2 mins walk by only 20 dollars,1
Great location| awesome restaurant prime ocean. Clean room| great view Great service from starting with the valet. Then front desk. All the aspects of a great hotel.,1
Love the Hotel and the staff! Customer service was everything!,1
The reception desk staff was very friendly and kind. Best experience I have ever had there. Would not want to stay anywhere else in Chicago.,1
The hotel itself was beautiful! It was impossible to get ahold of anyone for any type of assistance. I tried calling guest services multiple times and the phone would be left on ring for 45 mins. When I finally got in touch with someone the customer service was rude and awful.,0
Excellent Hotel and great location. We loved our stay.,1
Everything was beautiful. It was a little more open than usual but the first day the channels with the tv didn't work. But it worked itself out after the first night,1
Amazing Hotel. Room was beautiful with a nice view.,1
It was a great hotel. But 4 women in one room was tough. My bad for not getting 2rooms.,1
Great central hotel. Beautiful classyLots to do and eat nearby,1
Excellent service| my mattress was not comfortable and a few things needed fixing around the room| but it was otherwise clean and comfortable.  I wish there had been more dining options available in house.  But an AMAZING massage at the spa made up for anything lacking elsewhere!,1
Great location between millennium park and Michigan avenue. Clean and quiet,1
This hotel was spectacular from top to bottom. We absolutely loved our stay!! I must say I was a little surprised our room was not cleaned the entire stay. Outside of that| the stay was really good.,1
Great hotel and helpful staff. Spacious rooms and clean| modern property.,1
Best part about the property is the location and luxurious accommodations. Even in the pandemic. With the roof top access| we could enjoy city views safely. Cannot beat the location. Central to everything. The hotel staff were superb--so helpful and friendly. Would definitely stay here again. This was an essential travel trip| not pleasure but might as well have made it nice with LondonHouse.,1
Very friendly staff| everything was so update and cute. I loved my staycation this past weekend.,1
I loved everything| most of all the bakery downstairs. I do wish they could have provided some paper coffee cups in the bedroom so I could have made coffe..,1
Nice awesome views| quick access to great locations,1
The location of the hotel was fantastic-right in the middle of everything.The view from our room that they gave us was amazing .However because of the pandemic there was no dine in and room service and we are glad that the hotel adheres to the city's restrictions which means they are taking it seriously kudos to them...We have a little misunderstanding with the rooftop restaurant but it was easily remedied and corrected..Otherwise a very good hotel| reasonably price and very walkable to everywhere...,1
Great location| beautiful views of the river| great staff,1
It was wonderful,1
Great stay but not sure room was fully clean,1
The location is nice. Rather than that disappointed for the rest| including:- front desk from the first day check in. I paid with high price to stays in this hotel for 4 days and 3 nights. The receptionist treated me like i came in to ask for free shelter or donations. I asked to have a room with bathtub but how come my booking room does not have one. He said this entirely hotel does not have room with bathtub. And my room is the only one available now. So either i take it or just leave. When my room i already prepaid the whole stays. Thanks a lot for the receptionist guy| totally unprofessional and rudeness. - room service| i had to sleep in the same linen| blanket and pillow cases for the second night even though the room service already done the room cleaning| they did not change my linen| blanket and pillow cases and just put it back in place with dirtiness and wrinkles from the night before. Vacuum in room had not done right with all dirties around the coffee table. The third day| after cleaning the bathroom| they left my toilet rolls on the floor| next to the toilet seat. I stayed there from sunday to weds. Tototally disappointed. Thank you so much for this hotel service. My first time staying| my last time as well. Totally appreciate you guys for one of a kind of service| for an expensive stays| and for the unprofessional rudeness treatment toward customer. Wow.,0
Very elegant| and clean! Great views of the city| and a central location for so many fun sight seeing opportunities.,1
Really liked the service| staff| and beautiful rooftop restaurant! Appreciated that for the rooftop restaurant hotel guests did not need to make reservations| it was super convenient. Also loved their late check out| so kind of them to do that for free.,1
Very nice hotel with a great location to all the shopping and hangout places.,1
Great hotel;,1
The view from our room. Didnt like that they dont have any  microwaves inside the rooms,1
Just not what I expected for a luxury hotel| at all!,0
Great location. Walking distance to many Chicago sites! Beautiful river/city view from our room. Check-in and checkout were quick and can be contactless. The rooms are also very clean! Going to be staying here next time I'm in Chicago :),1
Perfect location| beautiful property!I always choose this hotel,1
It was good.,1
The Hotel was amazing| Loved our room it was cozy and very clean. The staff was friendly and courteous. The only issue was as a guest in the hotel you have to wait to get into the restaurant. The staff gave different stories about having or not needing a reservation to get into the restaurant. Paying guest should be first priority with or without a reservation. We waited more than 2 hours in a line to get in to eat. While outsiders went right up to dine. Not cool and very disrespectful to the paying guest of the hotel. Other than having to leave the property to get food this hotel is AMAZING!!!,1
Beautiful hotel amazing views| I did notice a lot of traffic going up the elevator to get to the rooftop bar| some sketchy people not so appealing when you have children with you,1
Beautiful clean room| friendly service and agreat view.,1
Clean hotel| nice staff| was given a room with a beautiful view free of charge. Beds and room overall are a bit small but other than that it was a pleasant stay.,1
The best hotel I've ever stayed at! Staff was impeccable.,1
Loved it! Very clean and sanitary. Even the remote was in a sterile bag. Bed to die for. I slept a straight 8 hours in heaven. Will stay there again.,1
Great view at the Lake Michigan. Rooms are very nice| updated!!,1
Get the river view room!! Absolutely stunning at night and gives such a beautiful overview of the city! Nice amenities| close to so many great attractions,1
Beautiful hotel and lovely staff| I'll definitely be visiting again. I had an amazing view of downtown Chicago. Only wish I was on a higher floor.,1
Great hotel and highly recommend! It's a perfect location and well maintained with friendly staff!,1
Checking in was very easy. Room was always clean and the staff was friendly,1
Dirty and service was terrible everyone was extremely rude.,0
It was perfect! Modern decor| friendly staff and prompt services. Comfortable beds| amazing location!! I would choose Londonhouse every time!!,1
Everything regarding the property is great| location is perfect| rooms are very nice (we got one with a view over the river which was awesome). The only setback is the staff| not very welcoming| and the staff at the Land & Lake restaurant (I'm not sure if this is actually part of the hotel) is the worse| really rude and impolite.,1
A vibrant hotel even during a Pandemic!  Room was perfect and had amazing views. Location could not be better.  We had a misunderstanding with the cleaning of our room but the staff went the extra mile to solve it.  The only thing we missed was visiting the rooftop| there were always huge lines to go up| and finally on our last day that we were able to get a table| we could not go outside because they started construction.  We would definitely be back soon !,1
This is a great hotel ! The location was perfect and the rooms were safe and clean. The view was awesome!,1
Top notch,1
Amazing location| near all the Chicago attractions. Great hotel,1
Our stay at The London House was amazing| I loved the feel of the hotel. Very luxurious| clean| great location and an amazing rooftop. Overall everything was great| expect for some bugs that we had in our room. I don't like bugs| and we did have some mosquitos in the room| I had to kill a spider because my husband hates spiders and as well as some other bugs in the bathroom. We did report it to the front desk| they offered to change rooms but we had already unpacked so we suggested if they could spray for at least the mosquitos but not sure if they actually did since we did keep seeing them here an there. We had an amazing view of the river| shopping| bars/restaurants| Millennium Park and many others places were just a few minutes away. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.,1
Terrible valets| slow and very expensive parking almost the price that I paid for the room,0
Great location near the river and lake. Very comfortable rooms and great staff.,1
We don't have full Customer  service..((( everything is nice,1
London House is the BEST hotel to stay in Chicago. It's so beautiful!!! The view from my room is stunning everyday| every night. My room is clean. The staff who checked me in gave me the King room with the city view that is amazing!! London house is the perfect spot| for views| it's in the heart of all the must see places| it's just so beautiful. I had an amazing stay and would use expedia again to book this hotel over and over again!!üíØüíØüíØ,1
It's decor is elegant. If you get a room with a view. It's stunning.,1
Awesome room spacious room with an awesome view! Great customer service from the concierge Ken!,1
Super nice hotel and will definitely stay again when next time going to Chicago.Also| the foods in the hotel's restaurants are very good too.,1
I had the best stay at LondonHouse. My experience went so well that my initial 3 day stay turned into a 16 day stay. Anthony & Ken at the front desk were always so helpful and professional. I can honestly say the staff was one of the reasons I continued to extend my stay. Everyone was so nice and welcoming. The room and view was exceptional. As I worked everyday at the perfectly located desk| I would look out at the Chicago River and I just felt so inspired. I loved how each room was sealed with a sticker so you knew your room was cleaned when checking in. The extra measures the hotel took to ensure safety during Covid was greatly appreciated including the signs indicating how many people are allowed in a elevator| the food delivery safety measures| and masks requirements when leaving your room. The location was perfect and I could walk everywhere and I did. The rooftop restaurant was absolutely beautiful and I had no problem getting a table even when it was super busy. For those times when I had nonstop meetings| the ability to quickly run up there and place a order to bring back to my room made life so easy for me. The Truffle Fries were delicious and I will surely miss those.  I can't say enough about the beautiful accommodations| the perfect location| and most of all the wonderful staff at LondonHouse. Thank you for everything. I'll definitely be back! ~Ericka,1
Great hotel| service and location,1
The room was small| had to pay upgrade fee for river view. We waited very long to get to roof top bar while we watched people walk up to the worker and bribe him to cut the line. Very unprofessional.,0
Staff was professional and friendly| it was well maintained. Excellent view,1
The view| amenities| and the service from the staff were awesome!,1
Location and room were excellent.  Due to COVID they offered to clean only in the morning and if you were in the room they didn't come back.,1
Beautiful property. Very friendly and helpful staff.  Rooftop bar is great.,1
Great location. Good sized and comfortable room with working desk. Glass door refrigerator. Sensor on-off lighting. Perfect for the business traveler.,1
The rooms| rooftop restaurant and customer service were all excellent!!!,1
Such a nice cozy place! Perfect location| great services and very friendly and accommodating staff. Will definitely go back....,1
Everything was perfect friendly staff & very clean hotel..,1
I loved that I was across the street from the riverwalk,1
Staff gives service to uptown people. rude to normal citizen. ive ask for room service never did get one. the positive is its location. excellent location|,0
Our stay was overall great. The room was clean. The view was amazing and the bed and sheets were so comfortable.,1
I liked everything about the property,1
I will be staying here again! Roof top bar drinks were EXTREMELY overpriced but other than that it was a perfect place! Was extremely satisfied overall,1
excellent geolocation and a gorgeous view from the room.  I like it,1
Amazing views. Great location. Great service. Roof top was beautiful. Will return again!,1
Enjoyed my overnight stay. Beds were very comfortable. The view of the Chicago River was really nice. The staff that we came in contact with were all very attentive and helpful. The ice maker on our floor was out so had to travel to another floor to simply get ice.  The room and bathroom were very clean. I used cavid wipes to clean the room once we arrived and to be honest it was not necessary. I wiped the tv stand| chairs| bed post even the window seal and no dirt or dust. Bathroom was spotless. Cudos to the Housekeeping Staff!!!!  The only downside was being a guest of this hotel and not be able to go to the rooftop bar without a reservation and of course they were completely booked.,1
Hotel was very clean and comfortable.  All the staff was great.  Would definitely stay again.,1
Beautiful view. Great service. Excellent location. And special thank you to Anthony for all your help!,1
Very nice place to stay| good customer service and convenient to all of downtown attractions.,1
Had a fantastic stay. Room was clean upon arrival and it seemed that they took appropriate measures during these times. Would 100% recommend LondonHouse to anyone looking for a place to stay in Chicago!,1
I have always wanted to stay at the London thank you so much for having it all together especially during this crazy time. Beautiful hotel beautiful location amazing views of the city,1
Was amazing staff was beyond helpful !! Hotel was perfect !! Would stay again !!,1
Hotel common areas and room were beautiful. All of the staff were friendly and accommodating. The roof top bar had amazing views and food and great service! 100% recommend!,1
The hotel location was sensational. It is a walk distance destination. A lot of bar and restaurants near by.,1
Excellent location| beautiful modern hotel.We did not like the automated elevators.,1
From check in to check out......awesome service!,1
The experience at this hotel was amazing right off the magnificent mile and surrounded by lots of shopping and restaurants. It's minutes away from the train station. The roof top was awesome to eat dinner and be amazed by the beautiful skyline,1
August 2020 - Overall the stay was good| clean room. Only issues: Due to covid - no coffee machine or complimentary water bottles| no dine in service. Nothing amazing but not bad either.I had informed the hotel that it was my wedding night but they couldn't do anything to make the stay special| not sure if this was due to covid or because they just didn't care enough to go out of their way.,1
Rooms are very small| and I'm positive that restaurant employee bus boy stole my iPhone 11 Pro Max and AirPods Pro. No cameras in restaurants to prove it. What hotel restaurant doesn't  have cameras on site? Not secure or safe.,0
Staff was very helpful and Polite. The rooms were extremely clean and comfortable. We Enjoyed our stay.,1
Everything about the visit was perfect.  We arrived a few hours early and they offered to send us a text when our room was ready.  They put us in a beautiful 9th floor room with a perfect view of the river.  It was disappointing that the rooftop restaurant was Closed for an event but the wonderful room made up for the inconvenience.,1
I went with a friend of mine and we had an amazing time. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly from arrival to the time we left. The view from our room was so beautiful (picture attached). Also| Ocean Prime is a MUST for dinner.,1
Had a great time! Really enjoy my stay| very relaxing,1
I will come back again| it was so nine it also had a great view| also Close by everything,1
Great location! Beautiful building and well-kept. Issues with the service team not going the extra mile to accommodate me when I had questions about their Rooftop seating. Reservations for the Rooftop are booked months in advance which suck for guests. Luckily| as a guest of the hotel you can stand in a separate line and wait for a table to become available. I feel staff could have expressed this more clearly. I paid A Lot of money to stay there for this particular feature| The Rooftop. Also had an issue one evening where someone in an another room was smoking weed. Kept us up at night. The room| hotel and the view was spectacular which is why I did not make such a big deal out of those stated inconveniences. Overall| I would stay again.,1
Beautiful view and excellent service .  We did feel our car was driven without our consent though,1
I had a very pleasant stay. Friendly staff greets you at the door. Hotel was clean| and covid safeüëçüëç,1
Very relaxing environment. Hotel staff was courteous and friendly. Anything that was needed was just a phone call away. Would definitely recommend.,1
The London house hotel is a amazing hotel with really good customer service .. I had a great experience there as a guest in terms of the hotel Hospitality.  But right now it's not a good time to go to Chicago we experience shooting right in front of the hotel with one men dead and a woman injured .,1
Enjoyed my stay excellent service|with a great view from my room,1
Very clean property. Located in area convenient for shopping and food options.,1
Very beautiful and clean. Front desk staff was amazing| rooftop servers was point. I will be back soon,1
I will definitely stay here next time I'm come to Chicago. It is downtown right next to everything. The staff and hotel we're on point during this pandemic with cleaning|making sure everyone wore a mask and social distancing down to the elevators. Hallway and rooms are super clean and bed is so comfortable.,1
This hotel has a very nice| welcoming reception area with friendly staff| all of whom were wearing masks. The space was cleaned and there were sanitizing stations everywhere as well as plexiglass barriers at the front desk. Covid safety was good.The room was beautiful and incredibly clean and tidy| very well-decorated and stylish. The beds were super comfortable and fresh and the bathroom was quite spacious and also very clean with good quality cosmetics and comfy bathrobes. Very nice shower too. Right in the middle of the city with a great breakfast option in the building.,1
The beautiful room and it's view were our favorite things about the hotel. The dinner at Ocean Prime was delicious.,1
Nice hotel| friendly staff for the most part.  Staff on the 2nd floor| bar area not too friendly.  Great room| excelent view.  Easy check in process.  Would stay again!,1
Very nice/chic hotel located in the heart of Chicago| across from the River!!!,1
Room smelled like smoke. Staff kept knocking even with do not disturb sign posted. Awful experience.,0
The hotel is nice and in a good location but we could not sleep most of the night. The ice maker was super loud! I got maybe 3 hours of sleep. Also| if you want to go to the Rooftop restaurant call in advance| at least 1 week in advance. We were not able to get there because we did not make reservations in advance. There is Trump hotel across the street. It is free to take an elevator to the 16th floor where the restaurant/bar with the view is located. We went there to take a picture. Walking outside by the hotel last night was anther terrible experience. Lots of homeless people literally walking after you begging for food| and lots of overdosed people.,0
Incredible hotel. Rooftop bar is unreal. Great customer service and extremely clean rooms!,1
Beautiful property and my riverfront room had a stunning and amazing view. Other than that| I was extremely disappointed in the customer service of the hotel| it felt a little run over by a younger crowd| the first floor of the hotel was always crowded with a line for folks looking to enjoy the rooftop - so there's a club line in the hotel? Am I in Las Vegas?  And finally| the wi-fi was problematic for my entire stay. Beautiful property| that's poorly managed and I would not stay again.,0
We enjoyed our stay in London House.. Feels like we're in a different country.. the rooftop was the best part! Overall experience was great!,1
I'm not so thrilled about the service. I called twice for towels and garbage to be picked up.The second time I called| Ken asked and he did his job. Thank you Ken.,0
The first room that was given to us smelled like smoke but a Manager named Bess took care of it and gave us another room. Bess was awesome and I because of him and his great attitude I would come back.,1
Terrible customer service. I requested for housekeeping as instructed and never happened. Also| the rooftop lounge doesn't give current hotel guest preference over walk-ins. Overall a terrible experience. Do not recommend. STAY AWAY!!,0
Room had a nice view| bed was very soft and it was decently clean.,1
Hotel staff wasn't the greatest. We weren't greeted as we usually are at check-in. While we were walking off from check-in there was actually someone there complaining about how this was the worst Hilton he has stayed at. We didn't pay it no mind but soon figured out what he was talking about. The hostess at the roof top bar seated us at a DIRTY table and didn't come back to clean it off. The waiter served our drinks| said he would be back to check on us and after 15mins| he never did. We had to leave because we were only able to have our table for 1 hr. The smell of POT was HORRIBLE! If I get drug tested| there might be a problem. It was all we were breathing up and down our hall. To say this was the best experience we've had at a hotel Hilton hotel would be a lie. If we ever go back| it will be to a different hotel.,0
We was really upset we didn't get room with the view as planned| but room overall was spacious and nice. Accept there was none cups at all and after I asked guest service to bring few| nobody shows up| so I had to go to hotel bar to get it myself.,1
Great stay overall,1
It was close to many places downtown very convenient,1
Clean| quiet and wonderful staff that greet you upon arrival. The best bell hops I have ever seen. Room was wonderful and extra quiet with a gorgeous view!,1
I love London house very nice luxury hotel. Would Recommend,1
That hotel was nice but remote didn't work and req new batteries but never was delivered,1
Hotel has a great view and it's right at the center so everything it's around and within a walking distance . But the room service not so good o stayed 3 nights and didn't got my sheets changed and only got room service once . But other than that great place to stay comfortable room and very nice view ! 9/10,1
Very professional and friendly staff..The rooms were clean and luxurious...The view from the 15th floor was amazing...,1
Room itself had cobwebs in a ceiling corner and food debris on the desk.  They advertise that they have a COVID cleaning protocol but we saw no evidence that they followed it.  The fellow outside the hotel refused to put his mask on when we asked him and did not social distance (we're 61 and 66 yo so in a risk group)  Of their 8 elevators only 1 or 2seemed to be actually working at any given time so social distancing was impossible.  They have a few signs reminding guests to wear masks but zero enforcement.  We've been isolated for 14 weeks at home but now| 4 days after leaving I have a temp of 102.5 and am coughing.  I don't know that it is COVID or that I caught it there but if it is| at a minimum| I've shed virus all over the hotel.,0
No valet or housekeeping. Good luck finding a place to park!,0
I love the property but due to COVID guest  wasn't allowed without reservations so I was disappointed. But I did ENJOY my view.,1
Great location| service| comfort| staff| and entertainment.,1
The BEST location!! The property is amazing| my only wish is that there was a pool. Otherwise| this is the perfect hotel. Beautiful blend of old and new| rooms were gorgeous. The rooftop bar area at night is spectacular.,1
Great stylish hotel in the heart of the city! The rooftop bar at night is a must!,1
A comfortable room and beautiful decor with a great scenic view of the chicago river. The food service here is great also!,1
Amazing stay...beautiful hotel sophistacted modernized rooms...super comfortable bed...only thing is the food was overpriced mediocre at best otherwise great stay great view..ill be back!,1
The view from our room was beautiful; The Roof Top was amazing!,1
We went a way for two nights for our anniversary amid the pandemic when things are starting to open up a little. The hotel was nice. I wish they would give those who are staying at the hotel first come to the rooftop. We never got a chance to go up because it was booked.,1
Amazing view of the Chicago River. We were on the 7th floor,1
The hotel was lovely to go to after being stuck in the house for 3 months. We stayed in our room mostly| because we're still in the middle of a pandemic. The staff was great about always having face masks on.,1
Great location.  Beautiful views. Awesome rooftop.,1
The best thing about this hotel is its location. If you are looking to be in downtown Chicago| then its a great spot. But the rooms are pretty basic| very small| but nice sized bathroom. Decor is very nice| gltizy and gothic| which is beautiful. Its a place to be if you plan to spend no time in the room.,1
The Hotel was very clean and the location was perfect for our stay.  The front desk check in was smooth and the employee was friendly.  The room was facing to the Wacker Drive and the canal.  The view was beautiful!!!We would love to stay there again.  I only wished that the public areas were open at the hotel. They were closed due to pandemic.,1
The front desk was Very rude. There were zero security measures at the front entrance during the riots.  Our key stopped working and they had to jimmy the door open. Doesn't leave you with a secure feeling. We had to sit in the hall and wait for the person to break into the room.,0
Really enjoyed my stay at London House.... I have not one complaint!!,1
Under normal circumstances it would have been a great stay| I visited the hotel during the COVID lockdown and normal amenities were not working. The staff was nice and even upgraded me.,1
Location and hospitality above and beyond any place in Chicago,1
Staff was very friendly & helpful & the food next door was great so we didn't have to leave the hotel the elevators system went out but they helped their guest by manually working the elevators from the inside with there keys which was great for us Because we had a stroller & our room was on the 10th floor ! So thankful for that it was very clean & had amazing set up all through the hotel.,1
Hotel receptionist was very helpful. Literally ‚ÄúEverything‚Äù was great| during this pandemic. Actually my stay here was the most memorable with my sons| only wish they had their ‚Äúown‚Äù parking. I wish I could have stayed another two days.,1
I've stayed at this before and it was great- this time though it was very understaffed. Also the elevator broke and was unusable the day I left. Very disappointing on the 8th floor Also no coffee maker in the room. Had to ask 3 times for one- then no coffee took another 3 times-to get it. Very unfortunate experience,0
Great Hotel! Clean & Quiet room. Right off Michigan Av. Will definitely stay here again!,1
Outstanding view but you have to pay $40 a night additional| it is totally worth it though..I wake up early and just look out the window and appreciate the beauty of the city..Room is very nice and cozy..Lobby is instagram ready..Highly recommend this place..,1
The hotel is beautiful and is kept to a high standard. It's in a prime location and every park of Chicago is walkable. It's on the doorstep of the river walk and there's a train station (State/Lake) about a 2 minute walk. The hotel looks and feels plush and the views from the room and especially the rooftop bar are absolutely stunning! The staff are polite and helpful. The rooms are modern| high end and super comfy and cosy. Highly recommended.,1
Excellent location| boutique hotel with quality service & amenities!,1
Location is amazing and the rooftop is lovely. Of course better in the summer,1
The room was extremely up to date. Staff was excellent & pleasant. Building cold n had propane heaters in lobby. I didn't like the the walls were thin n could hear others & my keys didn't seem to work next day.,1
Great Location right by the main thoroughfare of Wacker and Michigan Avenue.  The river view is Amazing and it is a great spot for picture taking and just enjoying what Chicago has to offer.,1
Loved this hotel.  Great location. Directly across from trump building.  Upgrade to river view well worth it. Can see all the bustle of the city and famous buildings| water taxi| all the bridges...  famous Lou malnatis (deep dish pizza) a short walk and worth it (make a reservation).  We stayed on  20th floor which was excellent. Had an additional room on the 6th floor (kids room).  The higher the floor the better the view in my opinion.  Rooms were clean and very comfortable.  Only valet parking avail (around $80 per night) but convenient.   No pool or hot tub.  Rooftop bar and area to view city on 22nd floor was worth viewing at night.  Room stocked w nespresso| small fridge- no microwave.  Robe and slippers provided.  From hotel we walked to magnificent mile (shopping)| Hancock Building| millennium Park (the bean).  Hop on/ hop off stop 1 directly across street from hotel.   Would recommend This hotel for a trip to Chicago (and I'm picky!).   Traveled with husband and 3 kids (14|17|18).,1
Great stay clean great view walking distance to restaurants üòÅ,1
The hotel is beautiful.  The bar upstairs is a great place to take clients for a pre or post dinner drink.  I love the overall style of the rooms and hotel along with the location.  My only complaint would be the automatic lighting in the room.  There were not enough lights in trying to work at night and the auto/ motion light switches were highly annoying in that they would shut off unless there was movement.  I felt like I was working in a dungeon at times.,1
A beautiful| iconic hotel that masterfully blends its historic charm and elegance with modern touches and amenities. Staff was spot-on. Great lobby bar| gym| and the location is primo. The rooftop deck is a must for a drink and the incredible views of the city.,1
Excellent location| views|| service| quality!Love this hotel!!!,1
The property is centrally located for visitors - easy walk to many of the cities landmarks. Beautiful hotel| very clean| great staff. Hotel room is a good size and great value. Only negatives we experienced on our visit were the cleaning staff knocking on the door at 8:30 in the morning to clean and when we left| no one could locate the valet to get our car (it was also 4:00 am when requested - so this is understandable). Would recommend the hotel for sure and would stay there again.,1
Plus:- Incredible service - The building is in a really nice location- Unbeatable rooftop view - Decent room sizeNegative:- No kettle or free water for room guests - Fitness center is not always clean,1
Great central location within blocks of the L and buses.All the downtown museums are close.We had a suite and it was very large.,1
Staying here is a must while visiting Chicago. Outstanding hospitality and great service! They went above and beyond to make my stay exceptional.Some of the best views with the largest rooftop in the city.I would highly recommend staying.,1
Great service. Friendly. Beautiful and clean. Spacious room and great views. Rooftop is fantastic as well.,1
Without a doubt it's an amazing place to stay. You're close to all the shopping on Michigan Ave and the river. We will definitely be back!,1
The staffs are very friendly and helpful.,1
Great property| excellent location and very nice people! Will stay again!,1
Excellent stay insofar as hotel was concerned| but the parking experience was disorganized on check-out. Had to wait 45 minutes to have car brought around after the attendant lost our ticket. For $73/night| the service needed to be better.,1
Great stay! Everyone is incredibly friendly| and if there are any issues| staff go out of their way to extend extra services to make up for it.,1
Great Hotel in the Center of Chicago.  Walking distance to Magnificent Mile. Amazing roof top bar with views of the river and architecture.,1
Excelent facilities| clean but took a long time to get a room.,1
Best hotel I have ever stayes at!! Amazing food| service| room| and views!!  Highly recommend!!,1
This was my first time staying here| and I would definitely stay here again! The overall hotel vibe was welcoming and bustling| the hotel bar has a great selection| and the room itself was pretty good. The only downside is that the room was a little small| and despite what the description said| it's not really accommodating for 3 people. But that's something for another time. Overall| this is a really nice hotel.,1
It was good. Great location. The hotel is basic| clean and comfortable. Not particularly luxurious but the location is very convenient. Views of the river are lovely except for the Trump monstrosity right opposite!!!,1
Hotel was very accommodating at checkin. Very nice stay for the first time.,1
EverythingRoom was great everything was on point good job,1
AMAZING location! Pretty much everything is in a walkable distance. The service was great| they were so kind| and the decoration inside the hotel was so pretty. I LOVED it and would love to go back!,1
We stay here every time because of the location. We received a beautiful upgrade| and the staff is always so welcoming.,1
The location was fantastic.  The cafe next door did an excellent breakfast.,1
Goood location mice view and reasonable price. Night view,1
From the moment I walked in the door I knew it was going to be special. Polite greetings| beautiful space| welcoming. We loved it do much my granddaughter wants to live there!,1
The staff and property was very accommodating. The old and new touches to the property was very well designed. We will be returning and will be staying back at the London house. April and Bess were so funny and answered all of our questions. The staff helped me plan a surprise and really pulled it off. They went above anything expected and really made our stay the best. Thank you to the staff.,1
Super nice hotel. Room was spacious and clean.  Loved it| great value. So close to the magnificent mile and all the festivities we wanted to see.,1
It was an amazing experience staying at the London House. From the front desk to valet parking was excellent,1
Great location in the heart of downtown. A short walk to Michigan Ave and/or Millennium Park.,1
A stunning hotel| right bang in the centre of Chicago. Close to all the sites and plenty of restaurants and other amenities. The rooms are spacious and decorated beautifully. Well worth the money and would definitely recommend staying in.,1
Did not like that there was no fitted sheets on the bed,1
The view was fantastic and the roof top is incredible!!!,1
Good service. Nice amenities and location. Nice rooftop.,1
Beautiful! Best hotel in Chicago! We will be back.,1
Pretty good overall. I did the ‚Äúupgrade room‚Äù for $100 more for the weekend and it wasn't as spectacular as they made it sound. I was hoping for much more of a view. We received a corner suite and were facing the other half of the building and the river but the building blocked most of our view. Then when we returned the following day after room service had come we saw our champagne glasses we had brought with us in their cart. Had we not seen that they would have been gone for good. I get that's a simple mix up but i would have been super upset had they taken them. Also when we entered our room after they had come to clean it smelt like sewage and the smell would not go away. We were leaving in the morning so we just dealt with the stench. We ventured up to the rooftop| insanely busy. Service could have been a bit friendlier up there. We asked how to get the to outdoor bar for the views and the guy said up the stairs. Well it's our first time there and didn't see any stairs and he directed us over as if we were stupid and showed us where they were. You're kinda of wandering around in the hotel. No one really told us where to go etc we had to ask or find things ourselves. They also do hold a $100 deposit for each night you stay. That was not listed on the Expedia| I had to call and ask. I loved the robe and slippers. Nice water pressure and heat in showers. There is no lock or regular door for the bathroom. Frosted sliding glass door. And no fan. No privacy.,1
This place is very elegant| clean| well located and convenient.The room was spacious and confortable.,1
Loved the location and the cleanlineas of the hotel.,1
Wonderful experience at this amazing hotel! Amazing property located in a perfect location! Across from river walk right on Wacker which is a perfect location to walk everywhere in the downtown area. Easy 10 minute walk from Millennium park and down the street from Magnificent mile. Easy access to public transportation. The hotel itself is beautiful very modern| clean & rooms are super comfortable. Staff was wonderful| with easy & quick check in. Will definitely stay again when visiting.,1
Very beautiful hotel and great location.  Very hard to park in front of and drop off our luggage!!,1
The staff was great.The room was amazing and so comfortable.I am definitely staying there on my next trip!,1
Beautiful property in the heart of town. I'd love to stay here again,1
This hotel was absolutely perfect| and it was in a great location. I really couldn't recommend anything better. I am very unfamiliar with Chicago| but flew in to O'Hare took the Blue Line train directly downtown (about 45) minutes got off and walked 4 minutes to the front door of the London House. The view from my river view room was incredible| I highly recommend upgrading your room (although you do have a direct line of sight to the very large TRUMP letters on his building across the river| I was less then impressed but oh well| locals say its coming down soon (the sign). The rooftop bar is magic and you can literally walk anywhere| I felt extremely safe. I cannot wait to go back.,1
Shout out to the concierge who gave me the tip on getting to the United Center.,1
This hotel is in an excellent location| within 10min walk of most of the sights. I have previously stayed at the Chicago Hilton but preferred this one.,1
The coffee making facilities in the room was useless| luckily there was a nice cafe on the ground floor. The roof top bar while relatively expensive is a must see for view,1
Great location| good views (except of 45 hotel)| decent hotel dining options| good space in rooms.,1
People at front desk were truly rude. At check in he charged my credit card with $100 per day because my reservation was in Expedia. No benefits for HHonors member| because of same reason.At check out the attendant said my $400 refund could take from 3 to 5 working days. Both employees were very far from sympathetic to a client. Smiled like saying: you see why you should not book in Expedia?Property is excellent. To bad for those two guys!,0
Just little comment on the question of whether they provide daily room cleaning as stated on reservation.  We are super care of the hygiene and therefore| this is really important for us.,1
Great location. We stayed here for the Chicago Marathon and it's a short 10 min walk to the start/finish line area. Room was beautiful and clean with a nice view of the river. Staff was very friendly. Highly recommend!,1
The hotel is spotless and it is in a very good location! We stayed for the marathon and it was walking distance to the start line. The Art Institute is also within walking distance! We've enjoyed our stay!,1
We were near everything and the view was outstanding. Had to go to the bakery each morning for coffee. Not a fan of nespresso. All the staff we dealt with were very prompt and helpful.,1
The staff was very friendly and helpful and the rooms were very comfortable.,1
Amazing - would recommend!,1
The rooftop deck is amazing! The view of the river from our room was spectacular,1
Great property. Great location. Very modern. Inside bar was amazing.,1
The staff was very friendly and helpful!! We definitely will be back in the future!!,1
Everything was wonderful and the service was amazing! Location is perfect,1
I stayed 2 nights and ran out of towels and toilet paper.  The only thing I expect beyond being provided a room while staying at a hotel is that someone comes to service the room every day| checking on the needs of the customer.  For $450 per night| I don't find this an unreasonable request.  There are a lot of other options in Chicago for future needs.,0
The location of this hotel is amazing! We have stayed here twice due to its location| walking distance to magnificent mile and the bean. The hotel also has an incredible view of the river| and the rooftop is a must for anyone staying here! Overall| I highly recommend this hotel.,1
Excellent views. Close proximity to everything downtown chicago has to offer. Very nice rooms.,1
Unique location right on the Chicago River| great views from the rooms and great rooftop bar.,1
Wow the London House did not disappoint Elegant | generous rooms and gracious and friendly service. The roof top bar is a must see be prepared to juggle for space though during early evening We will be back and let everyone know at the meeting i attendrd they should hsve booked here,1
Housekeeping works are not very efficient| we have to call guest service center and ask for making up the room.,1
I liked location and view from roomI didn't like double bed size| need to have queen sized beds as standard,1
A very good run hotel That was staffed by top level staff| who provide outstanding service,1
The hotel was amazing! The staff were wonderful and so helpful. It was centrally locates and we were able to walk to everything. Our room was kept very clean and always well stocked. The view was fantastic! Highly recommend this hotel!,1
spa location wouldn't answer our call when we got transferred. then we down stairs and couldn't find anyone working,1
great location,1
Loved this property. The best that we had in the USA this trip. Cassic art deco historical building. Room was modern with unique wall art if the buildings architecture. Great rooftop bar with great views and a good vibe. Close to everything of interest for a short stay in Chicago.  We had a room with river views so that was a big bonus.,1
Everything was wonderful. Location was excellent. The room was extremely clean and updated. I would certainly come back!,1
When we checked in we offered to pay our bill and they told us know we would pay in the morning when we checked out at 7:15 we had a knock at our door wondering if we were there and then again woken up at 8:30 by another person wondering if we were there when we left at 10:15 in the morning for our brunch and return at 11:15 we were unable to get into our room our key card had been disabled they had to have a manager come up and open a room when we address this with the staff they were apologetic and did take some money off of our bill but because the man the night before would not accept our payment and told us we didn't have to pay till the next day they were afraid that we were going to leave without paying communication is everything,0
It was great. Friendly staff clean room comfortable bed A+,1
Location was great| staff was professional and attentive. Rooftop bar was always crowded with non-guests of hotel and was difficult to get in.,1
The staff there was high class all the way from the gentleman who checked me into the bellman| doorman and housekeeping. They were all very friendly and helpful with everything I needed. I would highly recommend this place it's a little pricey but you get what you pay for.. Thank you London House staff for making my Chicago experience a memorable one...,1
If yr main reason for staying here is access to ropftop prepare to be disappointed| very crowded with areas set aside for functions.,1
Best hotel I've ever stayed at in Chicago. From the valet to the bell men to Trevor at the front desk for check in| it was a great experience all around. I would highly recommend this hotel and can't wait to come back!,1
Beautiful room (though I had to change rooms when mine faced the air conditioning vents). Loved the way the lights came on automatically when you went into the bathroom| v useful to not wake your room-mate! Strangest lifts I've ever come across- if you don't put your floor into the touch-pads on the landing you can't imput it in the lift itself| bit awkward! Rooftop bar unusual| great views| BUT crowded| few seats| no area for hotel guests| only if you re paying the ridiculous bottle prices are you allowed a table| no-one told people not to hog the few chairs with bags (I asked politely if a seat was taken and was told very rudely to get lost| staff said nothing. I did feel they only wanted Beautiful People' up there.,1
Super location - we got a room with River view - excellent & advisable to book one of these,1
What a view! Close to everything. At the start of Riverwalk and the Magnificent Mile. Friendly staff. Beautiful room. I will be back,1
Really beautiful hotel. Even more amazing due to the unbeatable Expedia deal!,1
Location great| room was modern and amenities were very nice. We had to wait almost every time to catch an elevator.,1
I went during the weekend of lollapalooza. The room and service exceeded my expectations. Thank you!,1
I'm new to Hilton honors program| . When I checked in I was told that my points won't be counted because I booked with Expedia and not directly with them| seriously? So the receptionist informed me that I only booked a standard room and that I could upgrade my room for $50/ night. I declined the offer| because I am expecting to have at least a decent room. We were assigned on 6th floor. The room smelled awful| like B.O. and I noted that there was an air freshener attached to AC. I went back to the reception area| and complained  about the room| she said the only room that's available is on the 7th floor. I told her I won't be wasting my time going back and forth without having a guaranteed decent room| so I told her I will just pay extra for an upgraded room. She said the only room that's available for an upgrade is on the  10th floor. I told her if we could have a higher floor| since I am paying extra for this. She said| no room is available on a higher floor at this time. I told her that I am really disappointed with what's going here. She said if we want to wait until a higher floor is available| I said we're willing to wait until it's available| Then she said she's sorry when she checked her computer again| there's no more available room on a higher floor. I was really upset|  she said she is just an employee and she does not make the rules. She said she will talk to the manger about the room| and miraculously we got the room on 18th floor,0
Very nice hotel| located right on the river with great views (if you're in a river view room). The hotel is in the ideal location for a visit to Chicago| central for Michigan Avenue and The Loop areas. Hotel in good condition with very little sign of wear and tear.,1
The Hotel was very close to shopping| theatre district| food| restaurants and cafe's. And we had a very nice view of all the small bridges and multistoried hotels from the room| the night view was breathtaking. The big bus on and off stop was right across the hotel and so was the Riverview Walk. Interesting thing about the elevators| is that it displays the elevator Car arriving at your floor| so there is no guessing and running at the last min. Great Idea.,1
The property is great. Wonderful location| friendly staff| always there to help you and answer any questions. Very clean.,1
We loved the location of the hotel. It's very central to all the things we wanted to do.,1
Everything was great! We would stay at this property again.,1
Location was awesome.  Great view of the river and skyscrapers.,1
Great hotel| great location and incredible (but crowded) rooftop!,1
Had a great time staying here for a few days last week. Room was very spacious| quiet| clean and the bed was very comfortable. Both check in and check out process was smooth. The highlight of amenity is definitely their rooftop bar| a great view of the city. Their location also excellent| they have most of the river cruise ports at their doorstep by the bridge| and walkable distance to the shopping area| lakefront trail and parks.,1
Great hotel and location. Rooms very nice and modern. Will stay again,1
The staff was always friendly| and extremely helpful with getting us toiletries that we didn't have due to lost luggage. Very nice stay overall.,1
Perfect location and a beautiful property. Amazing view.,1
Location and amenities are perfect for seeing all the sites in downtown Chicago,1
Only negative is the elevator usage. 6 or 8 elevators but when you put your floor in| most of the time you're waiting for one elevator and so is everyone else. Very annoying.,1
Gorgeous space and view. Classic building. Excellent service by all. Super walkable location. My *only* complaint has absolutely nothing to do with the hotel| but the bagpiper who stood on the corner across the street... and played for 8 hours straight every late afternoon into evening. You'll probably be out and about in the city ‚Äì but I spent a bunch of time in the room needing to work. Wasn't very loud... just persistant. Hilariously so!,1
Such a beautiful hotel and close to everything! Rooftop bar with the best views.,1
Service was below standard.Room housekeeping was late and incomplete.Very disappointed.,0
Great Location Close to most attractions and great shopping,1
Hotel staff were excellent. Hotel location was right near the best shopping and river access. Views from hotel were better then expected. Only negative is when you want to eat or drink on the roof. We waiting 10 minutes on our floor for the elevator. Called the front desk and they said you are better off going to 20th floor and then take the stairs. There was one elevator dedicated for the roof. A simple sign at the elevator would have been ideal stating this fact. Definitely get a reservation for the 22nd floor outside dining.|,1
We were spending the day in Chicago for My Husbands Birthday.  We showed up to London House and waited in line for the Rooftop Bar.  The waiting area was air conditioned and had a small Bar where you could get refreshments while you waited.  The Line moved quickly and once we were at the Rooftop Hostess area we were politely greeted and given an accurate wait time.  I mentioned it was his Birthday to Cedric at the Host Desk.  Cedric went Above & Beyond to make sure that not only we had an Amazing Table with a View but that the Staff knew the special occasion.  Cedric was Amazing as was our Waitress ‚ÄúQ‚Äù.  He checked in on us throughout the evening and made sure My Husband had the VIP treatment.  We had such a great time we wound up getting a room with the same Amazing view from the Rooftop. We also had a delicious Brunch with a View the next Morning on the same Rooftop.  All the Staff we encountered at London House were Attentive and Courteous and we will definitely be staying there whenever we are in the City.  A special thank you to Cedric| Q and Caitlin at the front desk for turning our rooftop visit into an Amazing weekend my Husband is still talking about.,1
Everything was top of the line. They got us checked in early| and all of the staff was very nice.,1
I loved the location and I did not like there was no pool.,1
Great hotel| very comfortable room| great view| nice bathroom and shower products. A bit of a nuisance waiting for elevators when youre in a rush| plus the elevator never went up to the rooftop for some reason| so i had to climb the stairwell. Wifi in this hotel is horrific though. Made work very difficult. I'd stay here again though for the comfort of the room.,1
"The location cannot be beat!!  So close to the river walk| close to the L for inexpensive transportation.  Quick access to the ""coveted"" rooftop bar.",1
From checking to check out our stay was amazing!The property is beautiful and the employees were outstanding.,1
The hotel was awesome. Except for the valet. Not only did the valet steal money(coins). As well as scratch off ticket left in the car. Very sad for the amount you spend $73 a night,1
London House is in the middle of everything. Our room was on the small side| but it was beautiful. We had the most amazing views of the river and the Wrigley Building. If you're looking for a party| the restaurant/bar on the rooftop had good food and great music - and more amazing views.  The ONLY negative I can think of is that the elevators are really slow| but it's an historic building| so totally understandable.,1
Beautiful hotel in a great location. We were lucky to get a room that faced the river. Go to the bar on the top floor it has great views. You can walk to everything from this hotel. Good breakfast at adjoining cafe.,1
Great experience. Being from Chicago I know the area well and there's tons to do around. London House is well known for its rooftop. Beautiful view from my room and the staff was amazing. The only thing I didn't like was the elevators. It took forever to get down. So much so my uber cancelled on me because I took forever to get down.,1
We thought it was great! It was very elegant and the rooftop was stunning!,1
We had a wonderful stay at the LondonHouse! Caitlin was attentive at check-in including her follow-up texts to make sure everything was satisfactory with our room. Dinner was great at LH21 and again| our server was wonderful and attentive! I would highly recommend staying here when in the windy city. I can't wait to stay here next time I'm in town.,1
Definitely will stay here again and recommend staying here,1
Great location! Every negatives comments about staffs| delayed elevator did not happen on our stay at all. You can't expect 5* service at 4* hotel obviously but I think London House doing their best. The location is super convenience| elevator is doing fine| no waiting time at all. I was super skeptical and almost cancel my reservation after reading all the negative comments and I'm glad i didn't.,1
The view of the river and city skyline was AMAZING! The service was so good too. We loved the Rooftop Bar on the 21st floor. It was in a great location near Grant Park. We were able to walk to Navy Pier in about 23 minutes. Also lots of shops and other great food options near by.,1
Great stay| beautiful hotel,1
I had a lovely stay at the hotel until just before I checked out. I left my airpods on the side next to m bed (which my colleague even reminded me to pick up as I was grabbing some last minute bits)|I then realised within the few minutes I reached the lobby so ran back to collect them. In that time| my bed had been stripped and they were nowhere to be seen. I confronted the housekeeper who got very defensive| which I was only suggesting that maybe they got caught in the bed sheets| but he was quite rude and not very helpful. I told the staff at the front desk as I left but had to check out quite quickly for a flight. They told me to call up and explain| which I have done 3 times and been promised call backs to no such luck. I travel a lot with work and am a loyal customer to Hilton but I feel in this instant I have been given no assistance and know that those AirPods were there emergency I first left my room. Very unimpressed with the lack of service I've had since.,0
The location couldn't be better. Clean hotel. Staff is so friendly. The roof top bar amazing!,1
We really enjoyed the staff very helpful and friendly,1
Staff were very helpful and room was light and airy and always clean.,1
Location was great| views were fantastic| room was clean felt luxurious,0
Would recommend| would stay again.,1
Excellent location and price was amazing for what we got. Size of the rooms was pretty small and minibar was empty.,1
Stayed for my bday| hotel was amazing| rooftop awesome and staff very curtious!,1
Location| service| and style of the interior were excellent,1
Great location and beautiful room.  I hate that they charge $20 to watch a movie though.,1
Great location and excellent rooms. The rooftop bar was overrated.,1
Very clean and new property - Staff was friendly and the room was beautiful.  I would 100% stay here again.,1
Room was clean and generous in size. The king bed was extremely comfortable. The location was fantastic| the gym was very good. Staff were very friendly and helpful.,1
Nice property with great views from our room. Easy check in and check out. Very clean room and bathroom.,1
Great hotel..still carries some mid 20s character| awesome location| nice rooftop bar... modern rooms and very clean!,1
Loved everything about this hotel| would definitely stay here again,1
Fantastic location at Michigan avenue and the river|||wonderful views of the river from the room| and a terrific rooftop bar with amazing views.  Adjacent restaurant (Ocean Prime| not affiliated with the hotel) accessible from lobby floor was spectacular!,1
Love this hotel| stay here every time I'm in Chicago| but service this time was not up to the usual excellent standards,1
Great location. Beds comfortable. Bathroom well fitted out.,1
View was fantastic and everyone tried to be helpful,1
Overall very lovely place i loved it One of my favorite hotels in the city,1
Loved the location. Within walking distance to most attractions. And the views to the river were amazing.,1
This was a wonderful hotel that pays attention to detail. The only downfall for me.....for this price....the bed could be much better. It felt like an affordable IKEA mattress(no pun intended| I love IKEA)...just not at 217 a night.,1
Everything from the service to drinks were amazing look forward to staying there again. However think that for the price to the size of the room was steep.,1
Cool vibe. Beautiful view. Responsive staff. Great location. Loved it.,1
"The following morning I woke up to dirty pillow cases with mascara smudge and I do not wear makeup| ergo it was a dirty pillowcase.  The shower piddled with weak pressure and I felt ""taken"" for staying at a rumored nice hotel when in fact it was flawed at every turn.  The only nice thing I can say was that the bellmen were courteous and that allowed me to remain calm enough to endure the rest of our stay with the knowledge that I will never return nor would I ever recommend anyone stay there.",0
the bathroom wasn't very clean when I was there. Other than that| everything else was great.,1
Great hotel to stay in| very modernized|  clean and great customer service!,1
We found this property to be very clean| friendly and central in location to all things. Upgrades were offered and very reasonable. The staff were excellent and very helpful. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to my friends.,1
It's very clean organized nice place to live            For,1
The light switches took a little getting used to| and the phone LAN cable was not plugged in causing a bit of confusion at first (there is a dial tone but calls cannot be made out) but other than that| everything was up to expectations. LondonHouse made my stay fuss and worry-free. Everything that I needed they had| and everything I did not need they made sure i never did have to worry about.,1
I always try and stay here when in town. Incredibly walkable to just about anything.,1
The hotel was beautiful  and clean. The staff were very cuteous and helpful. My only complaint is the high price of food and drinks.,1
Under construction. Super noisy from early in the morning.,0
Overall had a great experience you only thing that I would like to address is the fact that the fruit bowl that was so generously given to me for my birthday had some pieces of fruit that were brown on the inside.,1
Loved this hotel| amazing location and great view of the city and river. The only issue I had was that our sheets weren't changed after we spilled some sauce on it the night before but when we called the front desk| they apologized and the sheets were changed right away. The staff were very friendly and helpful.,1
Modern hotel that feels fancy. Great service and ideal location.,1
My favorite place to stay in Chicago...beautiful views| friendly and attentive service| nice lounge area| great restaurant access for breakfast/lunch/dinner| and fantastic rooms/amenities.,1
they had the elite game on in the lobby bar| had a folk singer playing. was very pleasant sat night atmosphere.,1
I left my room to get a coffee| not longer than a half hour and by the time I returned they had made up the room.,1
This hotel is in a great location and the staff is always friendly and helpful. I have stayed here 3 times in the last 2 years| it is m;y first choice for hotels in Chicago,1
Very nice facility and recently remodeled.  Rooms a bit small but totally functional and well appointed.,1
Great location! Very pretty building.  Staff was super friendly.  Rooms are a comfortable size.,1
The staff was great. Hotel was beautiful and clean. Central location made getting around easy and the roof top has great views. The room was very nice! I highly recommend it.,1
Beautiful hotel. Toilet kept us up gurgling. Reported to staff. They responded in timely manner.,1
LOVED EVERYTHING about the hotel. My boyfriend and I had an AMAZING time. Definitely coming back.,1
1st class all around. Great room| great location. Clean.,1
Beautiful Chicago Style property.  Highly recommend.  Beautiful rooms and views of the river.  Amazing views of the river and Wrigley Building!,1
Perfect location in downtown Chicago| we were able to walk to many tourist attractions and restaurants.  LondonHouse is a beautiful hotel| staff was awesome!,1
Amazing Definitely would stay again,1
Very modern| classy hotel! Centrally located to blue line| shopping| restaurants. Would highly recommendüòä,1
Hilton hotel but can't get Hilton pts.  No parking options.,1
Very clean and excellent services here. One of the best hotels I've stayed at in Chicago.,1
Great location. Wonderfully appointed rooms. Friendly| caring staff.,1
Beautiful view down the river Big floor to ceiling window,1
The location is excellent as is the service. We will definitely be back!,1
Location was excellent and staff was attentive and courteous.,1
No cups or silverware in the room.,1
My first choice of hotels in Chicago.  Loved it!,1
Nice location with very nice view on the rooftop. The only thing that I don't like is the size of the window. It's too small.,1
The view was amazing.  Everyone was so nice and check in was seamless.  Also| the rooftop bar was great and the hotel is very close to great restaurants.,1
Great location at the southern end of the Magnificant Mile.  Adjacent to a number of great restaurants and about 1 mile from Union Station.,1
Loved it. I had the best room with a view of the city and Trump tower building from my window. It was a great deal for anyone looking to stay at 4 star hotel for cost effective price. Il definitely come again.,1
Great location.  Very clean and up do date and well priced room.  Only complaint is that a cosmopolitan martini at the bar was $20.  A bit ridiculous.,1
The decor was lovely| excellent location| friendly staff ‚ù§Ô∏è,1
Amazing location and amazing hotel!  We would definitely stay there again!,1
The wifi kept cutting in and out which made it difficult to connect to the chrome cast on the tv. The Nespresso in the room was an awesome amenity. Loved all the toiletries that come in each room| since i tend to be forgetful.,1
Amazing views and hotel condition. Helpful staff and great valet service.,1
It was my first time staying at LondonHouse and I was very impressed with the level of service and cleanliness of the room. We had an issue with booking massages but the staff worked to make sure they created a solution and that things were made  right.,1
Overall great experience. I would recommend it for anyone staying inside the loop,1
We enjoyed the room and location. Our only complaint was the service at the bar on the 21st floor wasn't great.,1
Loved the location and bed was super comfortable.  Service was great and we could store our luggage after checking out before our flight.  Will stay here again!,1
Great location| great value.,1
This is my fourth stay at the London House and it never disappoints. Fantastic location| exceptional service| chic public spaces ( lobby| bars) and comfortable and spacious rooms.,1
We had a wonderful stay here. We will definitely come again,1
Londonhouse is far more style than substance. My wife and I were really looking forward to staying at the hotel during our time in Chicago. Overall| we were pretty disappointed. At check-in| the staff member upsold me on a suite with ceiling-to-floor window overlooking Lake Michigan. I was excited about the view| only to find out that Trump Tower was smack in front of the hotel. Not really the hotel's fault.There were several issues with the entertainment system. While the hotel boasted that you could log in to the various streaming platforms on offer (Netflix| Hulu etc)| that feature didn't really work. Talked to reception several times but they didn't help. After we ordered room service and asked for an extra set of silverware| it took the staff close to 20-25 minutes to get it for us. Finally| on the last day of our stay| the cleaning crew was literally standing outside our suite at least an hour before check-out time| waiting for us to leave. Every time I walked out of the suite| they asked me if we were checking out. They eventually lost patience and walked in even though we hadn't left the suite. Deeply disappointed with our stay. Spend your money elsewhere.,0
View of the river from our room was very nice| good location of hotel for where we wanted to go out in evening.The drinks always good in the hotel bars.,1
A very nice hotel with incredible views. The rooms are wonderful| clean and the staff is warm and friendly.,1
Great location| luxurious room| but staff is distanced though cordial.,1
Excellent...exceptional Hotel and what an awesome location!,1
We had a lovely experience at this hotel.  Staff were friendly| very clean room| excellent location| hotel has character in a good way.,1
Top knotch service| location and amenities.,1
Perfect location to do anything in the city and the views are amazing.,1
Beautiful Hotel| service was horrible!  Cleaning service was slow and they left a used comforter that had a stained blood mark on it from a previous customer.  Will not return to this Hotel again and it's a shame because they have a great location and the rooftop area is fun in the summer time.,0
Exactly what I expected a nice hotel to be.  Friendly staff and great location as well.,1
Beautiful hotel. Amazing views of the river. Friendly staff. Key card stopped working after the second day of three night stay.,1
Great location close to everything and magnificent views from our room on floor 17.Rooms are spacious and renovated!Great experience!We will definitely stay at the Londonhouse again!,1
BEAUTIFUL HOTEL ..parking sucks though. Wish I could've stayed longer.,1
It was an awesome experience| has an amazing view from the rooftop| luxurious rooms and friendly staff.,1
just a great place wonderful location outstanding service|,1
I loved the hotel views!!!!! It was absolutely amazing! The bathroom had. No shower doors and the water came out throughout the whole floor! And the curtains wouldn't close or open in any of the three rooms I had! But everything else was fine :) we love it.,1
Beautiful and comfortable hotel right in the middle of where we wanted to be in the city.,1
In my opinion| the LondonHouse Chicago has the best view location in the entire city.  You don't have to walk more than 1 mile to get to the famous shopping center on the Magnificient Mile.  You don't have to walk more than 0.5 mile to get to the famous food street around the Northstrom Rack shopping center.(behind the Trump tower).  The interior inside the hotel has the unique modern mid-century.  If you have a passion in interior architecture| I would recommend this hotel 100%,1
The most comfortable beds I've ever slept in a hotel ever!!!,1
A truly unique property. One could hardly ask for a more convenient location| more comfortable rooms or better service. There is an abundance of excellent food| beverage and shopping options in the area and the roof top bar/restaurant is very well worth the elevator ride to the 21st floor. The rooms are impeccably decorated and remarkably clean and practical. Excellent staff members and ambiance. Highly recommended for business and leisure travellers alike.,1
Great hotel.  Great service.  Great location!,1
Perfect location| awesome staff| classy hotel.  Stayed an extra night because it was so wonderful,1
Perfect location| awesome staff| classy hotel| stayed an extra night we like it so much!,1
perfect location| right next to Magnificent Mile. Rooftop bar is amazing. the only downside is room size| good for one person but might be a little smaller for families.,1
Close to shops and river. Right next to Michigan Avenue,1
This hotel has an amazing location that is super close to shopping and other great Chicago attractions. It has a lovely smell that welcomes you when you enter the lobby and the rooms are tastefully decorated with more masculine decor. The room can be dark at times| and in my opinion could use additional lighting. Although the frosted glass barn door style bathroom door was beautifully designed| I prefer to have a door that fully closes for more privacy.,1
they basically chastised me for booking thorough thrid party and said I could not get Hilton Honors points because of that.,1
Had awonderful time at this beautiful hotel! Staff was very friendly and helpful! Our room was lovely and the views outside our window were spectacular!,1
Great Hotel in perfect location to explore the city. Hotel personnel was very helpful. Amazing view from Vista room. I would not stay anywhere else in Chicago.Thank you,1
Love the room and the view it was amazing I really enjoy my time at the London hotel,1
Would highly recommend,1
My only upset was that I had to check in twice during my two night stay. I was locked out of my room on day 2 while running between meetings because somehow my reservation booked as two separate reservations. Not sure why this happened| but would hope that moving forward a two night stay will be reserved as one reservation for two evenings.,1
London house is an outstanding hotel to spend the weekend in Chicago. Great location and outstanding customer service. I had a bit of a problem regarding an upgraded room I paid for and didn't get. The hotel quickly resolved the issue to my satisfaction. No complaints. Second weekend I've stayed there in a months time and will be back,1
Room appointments were modern and upscale.  Great location.,1
Fantastic location with great views (if you have a room with a view). Quiet on the bedroom floors.,1
Great location! Price was reasonable. We had an excellent vacation,1
Great hotel.,1
Location was perfect and the staff was very friendly,1
Views of Chicago downtown. Wonderful building. Updated rooms.,1
My recent stay at the London House Chicago was TERRIFYING. The first night of my stay was one that still causes me so much distress. At 1:00 am| I heard a few knocks on our door. I woke up to listen what the situation was and if it was a drunk person trying to prank us or find their room. NOPE! This knock also occurred to the two rooms besides us. The knocking began to become more aggressive. When I got up to quietly walk to the door| I didn't see a silhouette of the persons feet so I thought they went away. As I looked out of the peep hole| the person put a reverse peep hole viewer on my door and saw I was trying to seem. (this was by far the most scariest thing I have ever experienced). Once the person saw me| they were POUNDING on the door so hard I thought it was going to break off the hinges. At one point they even threw themselves into the wall in the hallway that was adjacent our bed. I called the Front Desk and was put on hold for 13 minutes to ask them to send Security. 13 minutes is a long time when you're heart is racing and getting ready to defend your self out of deep sleep and ensure your safety. At this point| I was never going to open the door because the person was hiding their identity. The front desk said they would check the cameras and have security walk the floor. After I hung up with the front desk| the knocking had gone away and it was now 2am. One full hour of panic and distress. The front desk never called my room back to ensure I was safe....,0
We visited the loop area of Chicago for the  first time.  Our room was upgraded at no additional cost and the staff was courteous and helpful. Not having a tub and only a shower was a minus for my wife.  The room was recently updated and the beds were comfortable.  The view... splendid.,1
Upscale hotel in central location in Chicago downtown. We were able to walk to almost everything. Lobby and restaurants in hotel were nice as well.,1
Fabulous location| staff| and onsite facilities. Rooftop dar is amazing! Check out even if you are staying elsewhere.,1
Exceptional Customer Service.,1
Beautiful hotel and room!  Very nice hotel staff!No regrets in choosing this particular hotel.TV service was overly complicated and difficult. No local parking available. Only had valet service.  I hate all valet services.,1
Concierge and check in was so smooth. They even offered to upgrade our room for a beautiful river view. Communication was great; they are able to text message you directly to ensure your stay is amazing. They also allowed me to have a late check out.,1
We loved our stay at the LondonHouse! Great view of the river| comfortable rooms| beautiful bathroom--everything was perfect. The lobby/restaurant is very nice as well as the rooftop bar. I would stay here again for sure!,1
Could not get into WiFi but did not call front desk for help.,1
Good location.  Clean and comfortable . Pkeasant staff.,1
I stayed in a king room with river view and thought it was excellent. Check in was efficient and friendly| which is what I want after a long flight.The room was very spacious and quiet| the bed comfortable| the shower hot and bathroom clean. No issues whatsoever and would definitely stay again next time I'm in Chicago if the price is still reasonable.,1
Beautiful hotel| perfect location! Staff was great! My only comment would be the lack of food offerings after 11pm. While the rooftop is open late| we were told the kitchen closes at 11pm. Understandable if room service is available later for a hotel of this quality.,1
Booked a suite weeks ago. They gave us a room next to the banquet hall. Loud music until after 11. Long check in and check out lines. Staff give you a robotic ‚ÄúI'm sorry‚Äù like they have said it 1000 times. GREAT rooftop bar.,0
Very close to the heart of city and the waterfront is very walkable.,1
Beautiful hotel. Took a long time to get our room cleaned| but otherwise really nice stay,1
This is a brilliant hotel. Fantastic staff| gorgeous rooms/lobby/bar. The bed is the best I've ever slept in. The views are incredible| make sure you ask for a high floor!,1
We had a great stay at Londonhouse Chicago. We paid for an upgrade to have a river view. We really liked the view. We liked the location of the hotel| it is in the middle of everything. Restaurants and attractions are in walking distance (if you like walkingüôÉ). The room was very modern and clean! The bed was very comfortable! Overall a 4+!,1
Hotel requires service elevator to avoid staff with carts etc using already congested guest elevator along with massive movement of people traffic to rooftop bar/ restaurant.,1
The London House is a great find! We loved the location (central to everything we wanted to do) and at the Chicago River as well! The Hotel obviously had no control over the EARLY morning Stike Protesters with their loud chanting and drumming. However| it made for way too early disturbances on two weekend mornings in a row when we would have loved to hear ONLY the sounds of the City waking up. We will be back to the London House!!,1
Great experience| will stay again! The view was nice,1
Amazing views| super clean rooms| and super amenities,1
This was our second stay at Londonhouse. Our first stay was spectacular and set high standards for us. From service at check in to the wonderful spacious room with a great view| everything was perfect. This time we had just standard customer service at check-in.Then the room was much smaller and the view was just the building next door. I guess it was because we redeemed our free night with Hotels.com and only had to pay tax. Everything was still comfortable but I guess  we were just expecting more!,1
Easy access to all attractions| on the river| shopping nearby.,1
Lovely hotel| perfect position for discovering Chicago.,1
Great hotel in the heart of Chicago. Well equipped gym and nice bar/restaurant downstairs.,1
Great llocation and lovely hotel. Staff friendly. Would recommend.,1
Nice staff although not helpful with bags.Clean and new rooms but no baths| no swimming pool| confusing entry. Amazing views and location!,1
Our room was very clean and very comfortable. The location could not be beat. Situated along the river right in the heart of Chicago. A tourist could not ask for a better location.,1
My two grown up sons had an excellent experience staying at LondonHouse Chicago by Hilton where they attended a friend's party. We asked them about how well were they treated and both confirmed our hopes. Hilton is great at providing excellence is hospitality| comfort and service.,1
The hotel is located in a very good location| and the rooms are pretty nice.  However| the customer service is beyond terrible and you will spend the majority of your time waiting for elevators in the lobby.  The hotel has a very popular roof deck bar| and the lobby is perpetually stuffed with sweaty tourists in line to get up.  The hotel staff won't treat you like a guest| rather a roof deck visitor and make you wait in line to get to your room despite showing them a room key. I won't be wasting my time here again.,0
Registration person most helpful and informative. Upgrade room comfortable and plenty spacious as well as clean. Shower and bathroom well done. Ventillation quiet and effective. Adjacent Lake restairant excellent for breakfast both food and service; aberage for lunch. Location prime. Easy to get anywhere. Quality value. If you want a top contemporary stay| we highly recomend.,1
Upon arrival| we upgraded to a king corner suite. The views of the Riverwalk and Michigan Avenue were outstanding! We were extremely pleased with the room| staff| and on-site restaurants and rooftop bar. I would definitely stay here again on my next visit to Chicago!,1
Had the Most amazing view of the river and gorgeous buildings!,1
Excellent view of the city| prompt service| comfortable room,1
Great stay.  Had a few issues with keys| however front desk was very helpful and easy to work with.  Greta location and beautiful building.  Close to eating and river walk.  Never a need to taxi or Uber.,1
The location to this hotel is key. We were in the middle of everything we wanted to do. It also has a magnificent view of the city.,1
Wonderful staff! Excellent boutique hotel. Nice river view and easy walk to everywhere.,1
Also had to report that the safe wasn't working 3 times before anyone came and fixed it,1
Just about everything was spectacular! However| we utilized the pull out couch in our suite‚Ä¶ The mattress and comfortability compared to laying down on my yoga mat!,1
The staff is fantastic.,1
Simply outstanding location   Staff is friendly as well helpful,1
Very good location| Nice room,1
AMAZING!!! Gorgeous hotel and views of the river| I falled in love with this place,1
Good position to the Wendella boat port| stayed on the riverside with lots of fun.,1
Excellent view and location.,1
Beautiful and central 5 stars!,1
Rick from the reception was great and gave us a room with an awesone view for our first stay in Chicago. Excellent location. The hotel is very good and has an amazing rooftop. Will recommend it to my friends.,1
Super good and convenient!,1
Good choice.,1
Room is very comfortable.,1
Nice hotel with spaceious room| fitness center and restaurants. Had the american breakfast and garlic flatbread at the rooftop bar - absolutely delicious üëå,1
Excellent location.  Superb service.  Reasonable price.  Certanily hope to staz here again!,1
Excellent view on the river during St. Patrick‚Äòs day.,1
Wonderful view from my room. Excellent hotel. Check-in extra fast.,1
Great hotel located at a perfekt place!,1
Great location.  We walked to most places.  Very clean.  We were a little disappointed the pool was closed but under the circumstances we absolutely understood.   On the first day we were there one of the elevators broke and since we were on the 19th floor it took a bit of time to move floors but the staff was trying to help and let us use the service elevator to cut down waits.  The staff was so friendly and helpful.  We'd stay here again.,1
A great location. Big room with a wonderful city view. The small kitchen was very good since we have a baby.,1
Pros:The staff was super friendly and helpful. The continental breakfast was great. The location was super! Close to a lot of places.Cons: The room could've been a bit cleaner (i.e. you could tell that the vacuuming wasn't very thorough| mirror was streaky| etc) and had a bit of a smell.Pool was closed for maintenance. Parking wasn't on site.,1
Wish the gym and pool were open| but because of Covid they weren't,1
We had a kitchenette unit and the full size refrigerator was a real benefit.   The bed was pleasantly comfortable.  The location was very walkable to the rail and bus and shopping.  We felt safe and avoided walking east under N Michigan Ave after dark and walked on E Ohio street instead.,1
This property was perfectly situated downtown near the river walk and navy pier. I had a corner suite with a kitchenette and a great view. The train station and grocery store were about 2 blocks. Breakfast was included which was a treat,1
The staff was very accommodating.,1
The room was really clean and nice. Staff was helpful and friendly. Slight lack of communication in where to park and it costs $50 to park overnight to stay at the hotel,1
Room needs updating but a good room for the price| great location,1
Excellent location. Nearby Starbucks| Eataly| Nordstrom's| CVS etc. Substantial hot breakfast buffet. Queen suite very good size for 3 people but sofa bed is terrible to sleep on. Cushions on the floor would be more comfortable.,1
The property was very clean and the location was excellent. Parking was convenient and easily navigated. Staff were friendly and helpful. Even assisted me with retrieving tickets to the Willis Tower. I will definitely be staying here on future trips to Chicago.,1
I highly recommend this place! Awesome location in downtown Chicago; well-maintained property|  clean room with kitchen (with small dishwasher| 2-burner stove & a full-size fridge| great for a long stay).  And the best is the excellent customer service| particularly Jeremy at the buffet breakfast. Will stay here again.,1
Room is stink| dirty. Seems like they are not ready to open. Location is good but not for who brought the car. Never stay again.,0
I arrived couple of hours before check in time. And the front desk lady did not hesitate checking me in when there was a room already available.,1
The staff was very attentive and friendly.,1
One elevator did not work so I took the stairs. My room was on the 9th floor. AC in room ask did not work well during the day,0
Mold on the bathroom ceiling... elevators not working. Bathtub drain very slow. Musty smell in the room.,0
Everything was nice. Staff were helpful,1
Location is fantastic!,1
I like how equiped with a full kitchen.  The bathroom was nice and clean..The room was good but no outlets by the bed that worked to charge your phone. The 1 elevator was down which caused a alot crowdness in the elevator because it was a long wait to catch the next one. Over all the room was good especially for longer trips. Oh and they give you a nice large bag for ice.,1
Polite helpful and super friendly staff but serious issues with many of their services. No Wi-Fi for two days|  no room cleaning or  trash pick up for one whole week . Only one working elevator for a busy hotel with 19 floors!,0
Location downtown| near Navy Pier| and excellent dining & shopping options!,1
It was close to almost everything. Spacious and clean. The full kitchen was  added bonus. It felt like home.,1
I like the location very much. The hotel was nice also despite covid precautions| I appreciated their safety measures.I did not like that our air conditioning did not work in the room| it was very uncomfortable! I called to report it the first night| they brought us a fan. The fan helped a lot but it was still pretty muggy| as it was very warm and humid outside too.,1
Not well kept. Elevators only works at time and you have to wait a long time with big crowds to use elevator. No luggage trollers available when you need them. Toilets very mediocre. Would not go again,0
The toilet leaked the carpet was soaking wet. The bathroom tub moved from what I assume was rotted wood. The room above us leaked the walls were wet. The room itself was great! Spacious| clean. I disliked how gross the walls were in the bathroom/bedroom.,0
We moved from the first room she to a smoke smell (cigarette) in the room. They were very accommodating and moved us to a new room. Then| another party on the floor was loud and smoking (marijuana). I was told I was going to be brought air fresheners and they would send someone to walk the floors. Not sure if someone walked the floor but we were never brought air fresheners. The smell came in waves as they were constantly smoking. The next morning the smell came back stronger. I let them know and they said they were a non smoking facility and they would have the managers walk the floor. Both encounters the staff was super nice but I felt like there was no follow through and the smell unfortunately occurred throughout our entire stay. This hotel used to be our #1 place to stay with our kids. We even recommended this hotel to our family and friends. We will not be doing so anymore and this wteekend was our last weekend that we will stay at this property.The pool is also still closed which I did know about prior and was told we would get bagged breakfast instead of the continental. The pound cake| nature valley bar| and yogurt was a bit of a disappointment as well. Not sure why bagels with cream cheese or something more substantial wasn't an option. The staff has always been kind and friendly but unfortunately that doesn't outweigh the cons that were experienced.,0
Location was ideal. Walkable to shopping & dining. Very close to Red Line. Uber's available immediately. Staff immediately available to bring extra towels| etc. Spacious for 2 adults & 3 kids. The kitchen was well stocked with dishes. Loved everything.,1
Everything was great| the view| clean| parking is expensive at 49.00 a night. but that's literally everywhere in the city.,1
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay!  I wish they had another elevator or two| and I wish they improved the breakfast bag a little...but I otherwise didnt have any complaints!,1
Hotel was in a central location| not too far from the Michigan Ave. Our concerns for this hotel: *Guest Services was on the 6th floor| instead of the main floor you walk in on. *Our room did not have extra toilet paper *When we checked in| we were given miss information about the parking. *The pull out couch in our room was hard| creaky - felt like we were sleeping on plywood. Not comfortable at all,1
Loved the city view of our room . Room was clean and we were satisfied. Definitely would book again.,1
It was a excellent and very clean the only downside was paying 40 dollars a night for parking that was across the street in a parking garage. Didn't know about the extra cost till I checked in.,1
I would never return again. First thing is you are not told that they ONLY offer off site parking (parking garage) that you would have to pay $45 a day to park. To make matters worse the elevators were broke in the garage which caused my self and my children to walk down stairs with 4 large luggage. From the moment I walked in I didn't feel comfortable. The small lobby entrance (which looks like a basement) has people just sitting around who didn't even have reservations. Once I finally checked in. I specially requested a 2 bed Non Smoking room and I received the opposite with an extra dose of marijuana smoke. The rooms were nasty. Stains all over the walls and it looked as if it hasn't been cleaned in a few days. They did however swap us out to another room. Which was still subpar. Our originally stay was reserved for 7 days. We just stayed the 1 night and went to another comfortable hotel for the remaining nights.,0
Very nice place to stay|great location. Well worth the price,1
easy access to the surroundings and a pleasant atmosphere in the hotel,1
It was so comfortable we wished we could of stayed longer. There was plenty to see and do because of the location of the hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The only thing is when we checked in I was told I would get the deposits back when I checked out and I have yet to get them.,1
We loved our stay. It was so comfortable we wish we could of stayed longer. It's basically the heart of downtown| so there is so much to see and do as well. However| when we checked in we was told we would receive the $400 deposit back when we checked out minus the $90 total for parking and $4 for a drink. I still have not received it.,1
Stayed 3 nights. It was a great roomFor a great rate.,1
Very spacious and clean,1
This is a great hotel. The rooms are super comfortable and quiet and it's incredibly safe. It's centrally located so you can walk to almost anything in about a mile. The staff is super friendly and very helpful. This is definitely where I'll stay again.,1
I loved the King suite and the cleanliness as well as how close it it to everything.,1
Spacious rooms with appliances great location within walking distance of many attractions and shopping,1
There are only 2 elevators in thr whole hotel.  You have to wait for ever for one.  Later on in the eveming the line to get on is ridiculous.  We were lined up outsude just to get into our hotel to use thr elevator.   The smell of Marijuana throughout the hotel hallways were strong!   The free breakfast was a joke.  I do realize because of covid they could not do a normal breakfast but we had to pay extra for our 2 kids to get the free sack breakfast| an orange|  orange juice|  a slimy muffin and a breakfast bar.   Don't waste your time!  The one good thing was the hotel had a good location.,1
My husband was very happy with the space. He was able to work on his computer in the kitchen/living room area while I slept in the early morning. The room was comfortable with a nice corner city view. I can't believe that any hotel room these days would not have a full length mirror. Also| the bed coverings were minimal and the heater was noisy. There were a few minor issues with the condition of the room| like the towel rack falling off the wall that could be fixed. It was a good price for what it is and it would certainly be a fine place to stay again. It was very busy at the end of March with a lot of families and activity.,1
the suite was great the area was perfect i would come back when COVID is over.,1
Everything was nice its just that downtown chicago parking is ruff had to buy 2 day parking pass $90 extra. This should be mentioned if its not.,1
Parking was across the street - 2 minute walk from the hotel. We stayed during Covid so there was no breakfast or evening social but we had a small kitchen (stovetop/refrigerator/and microwave/toaster w/ basic utensils/pots/pans/dishes/glassware). There was no daily housekeeping (not a problem for us) but staff willing to drop off any needs (ice/towels). Easy access to bus or train/2 blocks by foot to Michigan Ave. Staff was exceptional.  We would stay here again,1
The location is excellent for enjoying the sites of downtown Chicago| enjoying meals at restaurants and getting food to prepare in your suite. Suite was clean.  Bed was comfortable. Definitely use a parking app like Spothero to find parking bundled prices.,1
I come here all the time they have good service help u right away one of my favorite hotels,1
The suite was perfect for our family.  2 Queen beds and a pull out.,1
Hotel was VERY clean. Parking was offaite and expensive. Overall good customer service.,1
Very nice hotel I enjoyed my stay here I will be back soon,1
The check in process took longer than usual . On top of that our room was not the cleanest | still things left from the previous people that were staying .,0
Overall| the hotel is mediocre and the pictures are deceiving. When we walked into our room| we immediately had to request dish detergent because it smelled as though,0
Cold air out the living  window's behind the Couch.,1
Excellent place to stay| room with good space and nice organized,1
Overall the room was fine. Just little things that were over looked. The tub needs to be refinished in the suite. Looked like it was dirty but the material was just wearing away. I hate my sheets didn't fit the bed. It was like house keeping only had one size sheets with them and didn't feel like getting the proper size. So they forced a queen sheet on a king size bed. Which kept popping off. I don't like when my sheet expose the mattress but didn't complain because i didn't want someone to have to enter the room.,1
Hotel location is perfect right in the middle of everything walking distance.,1
Great stay.  Affordable but very nice for the price.  Would recommend getting the parking included.  Kitchen in the room was awesome!  My family of 6 stayed comfortably.,1
I never have problems in no ways everything been good cool calm & collective,1
Pull out sofa was the worst!!! My daughters slept in it & woke up sore. All springs| no cushion!!!,0
It was very clean...Loved it,1
At the last minute| my guy & I aborted my bday trip to LA (because..Covid)| and chose 2 do an extended staycation here.. The location is cool| and both| Trader Joe's and Jewel are a short walk away..  Just about everything was wonderful| from check-in to check-out.....except that we had to call the front desk multiple times for missed details| as we discovered them.. We called for dish towels| dishwashing liquid| dishwasher detergent| paper towels| additional face/bath towels| a light bulb (yes)| etc.. I believe| with the knowledge that we would be there for 5 nights| that all of those things should have been in place.. Even if they were sick of us (i.e. me) calling| however| they never expressed it with words| nor tone.. We got what we needed| and they even gave us a few pairs of latex gloves| as we'd forgotten our own.. Nice..The only other slight bummer may not matter to many; but| the TVs are not ‚ÄúSmart|‚Äù and we couldn't watch our fave shows on the ‚Äúbig screen‚Äù.. We made do| though| and used my laptop when we wanted; so....extreme crisis averted.. At any rate| this was definitely a beautiful stay for us| overall.. We'll be back again..,1
Hope covid is over soon cause i can not wait to come back when everything is available again.,1
Great location and friendly staff. Room was very spacious and clean| great views from our corner unit suite. We knew about Covid and didn't mind the lack of amenities. Would definitely stay here again once Chicago opens up again. Good luck Illinois| hope you can survive the shutdowns.,1
The service staff was excellent. Jason was super helpful for us throughout our stay.,1
its all about location. location. location. excellent.,1
Loved it! Worth the money,1
Not clean. In my two night stay| i had to change rooms because the room next door made noise till 3am| had garbage outside their room in the hallway and much more. Also| in the first I found a long hair in the bed. Then in the second room| the sofa had crumbs of food and rice| so poor cleaning| doors inside the suite are dirty as well| tub stained of dirt.  Honestly| this has been the worst hotel I've stayed in.  Front desk people were quick and nice though.,0
Everything was Great!!,1
We had a very nice two night stay. Staff was wonderful!,1
The Hotel doesn't have individualized climate control rooms. The temperature is preset thru out the entire building. The building was set on cool however its was a cold and rainy weekend. All the hotel could offer was extra blankets to keep warm,0
Everything was amazing until the very end. The lobby had rambunctious children running around screaming and the man at the front desk came and asked my group why we were still in the lobby. I found it quite odd that he didn't ask the couple with the rowdy children.,1
The hotel was very nice sn spacious and big my stay was excellant also the queen beds seem bigger than normal,1
Very nice hotel| staff was friendly and accommodating.,1
Good hotel in the heart of downtown Chicago,1
Great just had to pay for parking and we didn't get the breakfast because of covid but the room was beautiful nice view,1
Very nice place close to downtown. Very spacious,1
My room was ok. I didn't feel it was clean. I don't know if it was due to the smell of cigarettes| the two smoked cigarettes I found behind the night stand while looking for the outlet to plug my phone because the decorative lamp with USB port was not work or the dirt on the rug. The hotel advertise it's smoke free but the inconsiderate smokers want to smoke any way. There was commotion on my floor had to call the front desk. The staff was the highlight of my stay.,0
Fruit flies in the sink and they did not say there was 100 deposit,0
The location is great & the facility is clean.I would come & visit again.,1
I stayed at the Homewood Suites over the weekend for my fianc√© birthday to surprise him. From the time I got there| checked in and checked out| everything was smooth! I told the front desk it was a surprise and that I had to decorate| they were more than helpful keeping it a secret when he came to the hotel| beautiful view of the city they put us on the 10th floor| great size for the both of us| right in the heart of everything! Extremely satisfied with our stay!,1
This hotel doesn't honor what is advertising on internet. Staff was very slow and not helpful at all. I requested a nonsmoking room but it wasn't. I couldn't sleep until 4am because the smoke was coming through the AC and impossible to breath. I called the staff| she said put a towel underneath the door! I said smoke is coming from AC| she said that she couldn't do anything about it. No cleaning services| dirty towels| dirty bed sheets| no hot breakfast or breakfast at all. If you can't serve breakfast because of the current COVID situation| just don't advertise it. That's unfortunate for a hotel that is in a great area with such a nice space to have a very bad service!,0
Nice and clean| room had a kitchenette.,1
The hotel staff was very friendly| the room was clean and the location was perfect for us. The only downside if you run out of tissue after 5 you will have to wait until after 8 to get more. Best advise order everything you may need before 5. I do understand due to Covid-19 things are operating different but that's a big inconvenience Especially when each suite is stocked with 1 roll for a family of 5. Even with that small hiccup we will most definitely be visiting this hotel again.,1
Walking distance to a lot of places in Downtown Chicago got the Corner View suites with nice view of downtown Chicago,1
Great view| great price. The no on site parking is an extreme pain!! Even with spothero. Took great precautions with COVID-19. Also their card machine was down and swiped my card an unnecessary amount of times. But overall I would stay here again.,1
Very peaceful the staff is very friendly rooms are very clean and I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the whole area  very relaxing and really love that I could cook my own meals just over the top love it most definitely coming back,1
All services discontinued due to Covid. So it was just a room. Very clean room i might add. No turn down service. Not sure why my 3 day reservation was split into 2 reservstions. I had to go down to the front desk and chack in again for my third day. Very strange.,1
Pool is closed and no breakfast! Front food never answers phone.,0
It was nice and clean but there was people yelling at like 5am and woke us up but otherwise it was perfect,1
IT WAS A CONDOM ON THE FLOOR BY THE NIGHT STAND IT WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE,0
It was a relaxing experience for my family. We celebrated my daughter birthday due to Covid-19| but we still enjoyed even though the pool was closed due to safety we still enjoyed.,1
Easy access from the airport. Staff at check im was very helpful. Social evening and breakfast was a womderful treat. Food was good. Because of the time I travelled I wanted somewhere with an indoor pool. The indoor pool was nice and clean. Easy access to major attractions within walking distance. The only this that waa disappointed about my birthday was the treat of the COVID-19 I didnt get to explore the area that much. However I did walk to the Navy Pier| Macknificient Mike| The Chicago River and the Millenial Park,1
It was a great stay| would definitely stay again,1
I would like to see better bathroom plumbing| i.e. stopped up toilet| tub backed up etc. Other than that| I absolutely loved my stay and will recommended this hotel to everyone!,1
Staff was incredibly friendly. Excellent experience all the way around.,1
It's a nice| clean hotel with a nice breakfast and free wine and beer during their Monday-Thursday social hour. I like free drinks| especially when the news keeps talking about coronavirus. Wine made it easier to cope with carrying Lysol wipes everywhere while trying not to touch my face.,1
The room was clean and very welcoming. The pool area is a bit small| and floaters should be available for the little children. They were many toddlers in the pool brought down by their underage siblings.,1
Loved everything and the staff was so friendly. Came to Chicago for my daughters birthday and glad we picked this location to stay,1
The elevator situation is an absolute NIGHTMARE. My fianc√© and I found ourselves climbing 15 flights of stairs multiple times during our stay. There were times we were waiting 20  minutes just to get to and from our room. And when an elevator finally arrived it was almost always over filled. We will NEVER stay at this hotel again solely because of this. Everything else about the hotel was great.,0
Proximity to everything. Free breakfast was great! It was a true breakfast buffet and not just cereal etc. staff was really friendly!,1
The cleanliness and staff are wonderful. Breastfast was one the best I've had in a hotel,1
Property is centrally situated between great Chicago eateries and shopping stores. Take advantage of two Whole Foods| one of which has a bar. Enjoyed the warm| rooftop pool but not as much when crowds come on the weekend. The food was pretty good| better on weekdays. Valet was fast| convenient. All in all| this is where you wanna be. We felt safe| had fun| and slept like babies.,1
Room is clean and staff is very nice. Breakfast is good and the meal provided Monday-Thursday night is a very nice perk. However| rooms are showing wear and could use some mending/updating.,1
Service was excellent and they went out of their way to help me when I needed to print some legal sized documents in their lobby.  Location was really nice| short walking distance to many locations| L stops| bus stops etc.  It was nice to have breakfast there| even during the busy times| it was restocked quickly.,1
The hotel was wonderfull very clean and quiet is very well located with a lot anmenities around i loved. this hotel,1
Great location| friendly staff| nice amenities. A bit understated from the street level. But quite nice and clean and recently updated inside.,1
We really enjoyed our stay. The hotel was very clean and well maintained. The pool was nice sized and the perfect temp. The breakfast buffet had a lot of options and the staff did an amazing job keeping items stocked/refreshed even with the large amount people that were down there every morning. There was one gentleman who seemed to be in charge of the breakfast buffet and he deserves a raise! He was working so hard clearing tables| taking plates from guests| and just keeping the area running smoothly. Each morning he greeted us with a good morning and a smile. Customer service like that goes a long way! I wish I would have gotten his name!,1
AMAZING ! kids (4 &7) LOVED the view as did we on the 7th floor.. when we needed extra blankets| and services we got them almost instantly.. breakfast was delicious| staff was friendly EVERY day.. hard to find service such as this hotel| great place to stay| if ever in Chicago this WILL be our place to stay !!!,1
I like the good service as well as the location...,1
I liked the kitchen area to the hotel.  I didn't like that there wasn't any drinking water available.,1
The manager when we check in was the worst! Very unprofessional and no customer service skills at all! I would've have left but my son wanted to stay. Never again will I go back!,0
The location was near everything we wanted to do in the city - either walking distance or short bus ride.  The suite was roomy| clean and very nice with the full kitchen and good views of the city.  The breakfasts were super with lots to choose from. We've stayed at another Homewood Suite in the city and we will always go back.,1
The pool was great! The staff is nice. The heating system in the rooms was wack. It was either turn off or blast heat that couldn't be regulated to a certain degree. The heater would make the room unbearably hot and staff said it was unfortunately all or nothing during the winter and told me to crack the windows to regulate the temperature. It wasn't really helpful and created a cold breeze for my kids. It was cold at night.  It was a nice stay but I would avoid it for this reason.,1
Easy checkin and checkout. Nice breakfast Needed some si us meds and they had them at reasonable price. Luv the location.,1
Great customer service! Breakfast and managers specials were bountiful,1
The staff were extremely helpful and went out of their way!,1
Overall hotel was perfect. Room was clean and quite.  Hotel location was great.  Right downtown.  Only below grade would be the free breakfast.  Staff was friendly but the food not so.  Kinda a disappointing since i just stayed at a homewood in detroit and the breakfast was really good.,1
I liked the kitchen it makes you feel like you're home. But the rooms wasn't very clean| a certain front desk agent wasn't a pleasant to work with and the elevator literally was dirty the whole weekend. I will never come back again,0
Great hotel and location. Inside rooftop pool. Nice free breakfast. I will stay again for business. Great room set up,1
Overall good experience. The staff was extremely friendly.,1
Awesome location with great views| very clean| friendly staff.,1
stayed 3 nights over New Years| the area is central for shopping| eating and night life.Would definitely stay there again.,1
This hotel was fine. Service was decent| free breakfast was par (it was a buffet style with french toast| scrambled eggs| tots| sausages| and other options)| and room with kitchenette is very cool. Problem with some stains left on the bathroom floor| so cleanliness is questionable. Everything else looked OK from a cleaning point of view| but it does make you wonder. The pool area DO NOT HAVE A HOT TUB. So if that is important to you| stay somewhere else. That was almost a bummer for us| but we didn't have our kids with so it ended up being OK. Valet parking in Chicago is outrageously priced; that being said| this hotel's valet service was as described| and the car was in same condition and had not been noticeably driven other than being parked. Google maps says this hotel is off OHIO street but if you look carefully you enter off GRAND avenue. Overall good experience| would stay again myself| but not with kids (they like the hot tub).,1
Good location and nice hotel.,1
We stayed at 3 hotels in Chicago and this one was by far the best but surprisingly the cheapest! Great location and incredibly spacious. Had everything you would need and even offered free breakfast,1
It was great! Clean. Nice location.,1
I would definitely like to stay here again. This was an excellent property!  I enjoyed my stay.,1
The hotel is located close to many restaurants (including family friendly ones) and bars for adult time. The staff was all very pleasant and the breakfast was really good and refreshed in a timely manner. All of the bellhop staff was excellent with directions or whatever we needed. Two small complaints. The lock on the men's bathroom in the pool area was not functioning properly. And the men's bathroom on the lobby level was not clean on Sunday afternoon. Multiple stalls were in disarray. I would stay here again for all the price and staff friendliness.,1
Breakfast was great added benefit to this property. Food was good and very friedly staff.,1
Would definitely be going back to stay at this hotel !! It was amazing!,1
Great location in downtown Chicago and very cozy suites. Was a perfect place to spend my one free night in downtown Chicago. Thanks for a great stay!,1
Nothing at al nothing to write home about staff and rooms terrible,0
Close to downtown and train. Great for families with kitchenette.,1
The staff helped| celebrate my wife| Tammy's birthday by presenting her a birthday cake and sing happy biethday to her. It was the most memorable event in our lives.,1
Staff is GREAT. The breakfast had real| fresh fruit - blueberries were wonderful| and the social/snack time was a pleasant surprise as well. Highly recommend this hotel.  Sammy at the reception desk (floor 1) was fabulous!,1
The staff were extremely friendly| the room was clean and comfortable| and the location was great!,1
Room was nice| staff were nice. Breakfast was terrible.,1
The staff was very friendly and helpful. Great location!The bathroom ceiling in our room is due for scraping| filling| painting.Other than that| the place was very satisfactory.,1
Very nice place| friendly attentive staff.  Enjoyed the wine and dinner in the evening|  good breakfast took the rdge off ths crazy price for the night.   Not that this room was extremely excessive in comparison|  just that rooms in the city are ridiculous  price wise,1
This place is great! We stay here every time we come to Chicago. The location is perfect! The service is top notch and you can't go wrong with the hot breakfast and evening social. Our only complaint was the pull out couch was so loud and uncomfortable. :-/ Our daughter ended up having to sleep on the couch which was too short for her.,1
the breakfast and servers were great . the location was excellent; the pool is much smaller than the photo online.Everything was great except the price was a little high for the simpleness of the room. the remote in the king bedroom did not work. the doormen were very accomodating and helpful with suggestions. i would stay here again!,1
Perfect location| perfect for family. The staff was caring for our needs. Thanks to Erin for her personal sense of receptiveness.,1
Its in the city |so everywhere you go |its walking distance|my opinion is to save time and money |go catch the metro or.i really loves the river cruise of wendella with the guide molly|she is really an experienced guide,1
Exercise area needs better ventilation and temp adjustment.   Would be nice to have a ‚Äúreal‚Äù stationary cycle the one they have is rather pathetic. Also 2 elliptical.   Sometimes space is very crowded.,1
Excellent hotel and location. We loved the room and location very much. Also the breakfast was very good.,1
Good place.  Homewood Suites seems to be one of the hotels that tells their employees to smile and be nice to guest.  Good job.,1
"Wonderful location. We walked everywhere. The stop for the free Navy Pier trolley is steps away. We had a one-bedroom suite for a grandmother| daughter| grandson and nephew. Plenty of room for everyone. Breakfast was good. Evening social hour was ample and made for a quick dinner one night before heading out. Food was ""buffet"" quality = good! Would definitely stay at this location and chain again.",1
Very friendly staff! Excellence day!,1
Great location| great hotel| excellent staff!,1
What I found to be impressive about this hotel is how well the noise from the city did not find its way into my suite or common areas. Beautiful views of the city surround the hotel| however| you do not have to hear it. The sixth floor combines the front desk with a comfortable seating area and a dining room offering a great view. Be sure to take advantage of the evening social on the sixth floor where free food and beverages are provided.,1
I would highly recommend this place| very clean and in a major tourist location.,1
The location was great. Free trolley to the Pier right outside. Room clean| bed comfortable| staff friendly & accommodating.,1
Great location and the front desk service is wonderful. Very nice ladies.  Rooms were perfect.  The bathroom was not my favorite (sink outside of the shower/toilet area) no privacy from sleeping partner.  Also the elevator is so slow| at high time| but otherwise| loved the hotel.,1
All in all| I enjoyed my stay| and would stay here again.,1
Great location| friendly staff.  Perfect for families.,1
The staff is extremely friendly and goes out of their way for you.  I love the breakfast|gym| and indoor pool.  I will definitely stay her many times.  It is centrally located| less than two blocks from the subway.,1
Great location. Clean. Great breakfast. Friendly staff.,1
Great plc to stay and was so convenient to were I needed to be during the day. Would stay there again.,1
Great location with easy access to Navy Pier and Mag Mile. Good restaurants nearby. Breakfast with good options and evening social.,1
Loved that you could walk to everything. Great top floor pool!! Kids loved swimming with the city buildings behind them! Very clean and family friendly. Staff all very nice and approachable.,1
Great extended stay hotel in a central location for walking/access to transit.  Rooms were a little crowded if you were truly staying for an extended period of time| but totally manageable.  We enjoyed the complimentary breakfast every morning before heading out and made use of the small fitness area.,1
I stayed for 3 nights and the service was really good. However| the bathroom and bathroom sink had a strong odor of the sewer. Plus| I noticed 3 red spots on my body that were indicative of bed bugs.,1
Overall great experience - would recommmend50 char min for review is silly.,1
Suite was great! Very spacious and had everything we needed. Pool was a bit dated and could use updating. Also breakfast was typical hotel breakfast| nothing special. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. Hallways were quiet. Would recommend!,1
The hotel itself was really good but I did not take into account that it is downtown in a large city so there is honking/sirens going on throughout the entire night.,1
Great customer service. The 6th floor lobby was dope and efficient,1
The staff was very friendly.  Everything was clean.,1
I loved the amount of space. It was really nice to have a kitchen with a full refrigerator to use. When on vacation| I don't like to have to go to a restaurant for every meal| so that was a plus if I wanted to just cook a meal in my room. The free breakfast options were good. I wished I remembered the free dinner as well. Monday-Thursday they serve free dinner that includes wine and beer. There is also an on site laundry room| so I went home with clean clothes making it one less thing to do coming home from vacation. This location is around the corner from Eataly and a couple blocks from Magnificent Mile. The staff was friendly and helpful. I look forward to another stay here again. I have a feeling this place will be our go-to for future visits to Chicago or anywhere else.,1
Amazing stay. Great buffet breakfast and 5-7 Buffet on Thursday night was a perfect dinner for my 90 year old mother in law. She loved staying at the hotel and thought it was such a treat!,1
Johanna and Andrea were great!,1
3 night family trip.  Everything was great.  Jeremy and Priscilla were amazing at the complimentary Continental breakfast every day.,1
Mattress was terrible sofa bed also bathroom was making lots noise was terrible comfort f kids to sleep,0
I would have given it a 5 start except for one complaint about the furniture.  The sofa and chair were extremely uncomfortable.,1
The room was clean| VERY quiet| and well kept.  The location is also great (being two blocks west of Michigan Avenue is extremely convenient to Mag Mile| downtown| the 'L' (a Red Line station was one block away)| as well as a 7-11 and a Trader Joe's.  My only complain was that the room did NOT have a safe| so that if you brought a little extra cash and an extra credit card| you needed to carry them around with you (sort of defeating the purpose for bringing extra cash and an extra credit card).  I hope that hotel management will soon install a safe in each room.,1
Our first time at this hotel in the heart of Chicago| and we could not have been happier! Great location| smart room layout| friendly staff| superb housekeeping (16th floor). Many families stayed here during spring break| which could be felt during breakfast| dinner social| and at times at the pool. However| the dining staff moved at an amazing speed and efficiency| we never had any issues.,1
Wonderful staff and very kid friendly amenities!  Rooms comfortably fit a family of four with parents in the king bed and kiddos in the pullout couch.  Location is walking distance to tons of restaurants| shops and the Chicago river.,1
Spacious suite. Pool on 19th floor has an amazing view.,1
Loved the hotel| staff was great| food was good| very clean,1
We loved the place. Will stay again.,1
Very walkable area. Nice staff. Decent breakfast. Clean room.,1
We loved the breakfast| evening social with drinks and dinner. Staff was all extremely friendly| helpful. We will def. stay here again if we return to chicago.,1
The hotel room (a suite really) was great except for the sofa which was a sleeper bed as well.  It wasn't very comfortable to sit on| but otherwise the suite was great.  Full kitchen| separate bedroom and two TVs - which is great as I am not a morning person but my hubby is!,1
The hotel was very nice| and we can't wait to stay again.,1
This hotel had a friendly staff that was very helpful.  The location was very close to a red line stop that had an accessible entrance| which is really nice when you have small children that need to be in a stroller.,1
Amazing hotel would recommend to anyone. Great service| spotlessly clean| great breakfast and evening social| great location| great price for what you get. The only issue was that the sofa bed was very uncomfortable but apart from this it was one of the best hotels we have stayed at.,1
Absolutely loved staying at homewood suites. My boyfriend and I were able to relax and enjoy our time not just together but in a comfortable place. The customer service was so helpful and nice. The room was clean and spacious for us especially since we are some tall people. Lol. Thanks for the stay homewood!,1
The staff was extremely nice and accommodating. It was in a great location| right in downtown Chicago and didn't cost an arm and a leg.,1
We are definitely coming  back|good food a lot of choices for breakfast. They even have a complementary dinner. Good location  for shopping as well. We really enjoyed our stay.,1
Pretty clean environment| i liked it very much. The only thing I wanted to have a commend was to make sure the time that custmer check out. The housekeeping opened the door when we were still in the room.,1
Michael on the check in was greatFree breakfast was great Security Housekeeping did not restock coffee I killed  a bedbug on the sheet,0
The Bed and Bathroom were well furnished and very comfortable. Not that we spent much time sitting in the living room area but the chairs and couch were not very comfy. Cushions were stiff but yet the couch sank in the center. The hotel is close to a first responder station and we could clearly hear the sirens at all times day and night even on the 14th floor.,1
Nice hotel! Would have liked more if the heat could be more consistent.,1
Our 2-night stay went great. Location is good| walking distance to our favorite place to grocery shop & eat| Eataly! Walking distance to PF Changs and Pizzeria Uno as well. They also serve snacks from 5-7pm during weekdays. They have a heated pool which is also a plus. But I do think that the front desk person could smile a little more and that the complimentary bottled water should be given everyday| not just one time per stay.,1
Nice| roomy| quiet| and good breakfast.,1
The location is very convenient and close to a lot stores and restaurants that my daughter and her friend want to go to. The room is clean and has the basic kitchen appliances should you need to use one.,1
The hotel is in a good location| surrounded by shops and restaurants. It is close to public transport giving links to all over the city. Staff is very friendly and willing to help whenever necessary. It has everything you need for a short or a long stay.,1
Nice hotel. Close to key locations and silent rooms,1
The room cleaning staff is a disaster| entered the room using rude language and throwing things inside the room| worst experience ever in a hotel| never ever dare to choose this property| is so unclean my whole family experienced skin rashes.,0
Close to restaurants| shopping| and entertainment!  Very clean.,1
we stayed there for two nights. The staff were very friendly| and great location. Nice view! Our daughter loves the rooms| and she wanted to give 9.5 points...,1
Room was very clean and lookedRecently renovated. Staff were very courteous. Breakfast was so-so.,1
Amazing place to stay| the service provided was by far the best we have experienced in Chicago. The breakfast was a great touch. The hotel is kid friendly and close to everything. Best value hands down!,1
Awesome room as always love staying at Homesuites. It was super convenient to the magnificent mile,1
Location is excellent: many nice eateries in area and close to shopping and Michigan Ave. Staff were friendly and very accommodating.,1
The location was excellent. It was close to the subway and bus system. Lots of shops and restaurants around. The room was spotless! The view was lovely. The breakfast got boring after a few days - eggs| sausage...In all I highly recommend this hotel.,1
Everything was very nice. Nice people. Clean room. Good breakfast. Good WiFi. Only thing not up to par was the bed sheets. They seemed to have a dull smell of cigarettes. Not the room. Just the sheets. Otherwise all was good.,1
Everything was just fine. I really enjoy my stay there,1
Great location! Comfortable and spacious rooms. Breakfast was very good!,1
Great downtown location with clean and comfortable rooms.,1
Breakfast could be better!,1
Plus- Room was very spacious| gorgeous view of the city| breakfast was good| staff super friendly. Downsides- beds were a little lumpy| pulls in carpet on the edge,1
We did not have control of heat and air| so when the hotel turned ont he heat| we were sweating with no control other than to open our windows! you cant open windows when it is freezing outside and you have 2 babies staying in the room! We had to ask for our roomt o be serviced x 2 days.We had construction noise throughout our room and we were not notified ahead of time from our stay| even thought he hotel was WELL AWARE that it was going on! We would have cancelled our stay becasue our children did not sleep for 2 days in a rown becasue of the noise. UNACCEPTABLE. When I addressed it with the front desk they basically said it was out of their control with no remedy and no fix to the situation.  They also said they could not comp a day or discount becasue we had booked through expedia. Are you kidding| this is ridiculous.,0
Hotel is just a VERY short block from the GRAND/STATE red line subway station.  We will be back.,1
Check in was great!  They upgraded our room and gave us a bottle of wine for our anniversary!  The next morning they were very pleasant and conversational!,1
It was in the perfect location near everything you could possibly need. The staff was very attentive and courteous,1
Liked location| and staff was excellent.  Didn't like swimming pool.  Perhaps they should move to half chlorine and half bromine to reduce the bleach smell.,1
Perfect central location to explore Chicago| loads of bars & restaurants within walking distance,1
Staff all wonderful!,1
There were different price options. I chose the highest option for the same kind of room because I thought it would be up higher. Was put on the bottom floor. Why would you offer same rooms with higher prices? Feel like hotels.com screwed me over.,0
Great hotel and location.  The pull out coach in our room was in desperate need of replacement.  The cushions were worn and dirty.  The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful.,1
This was our first time here but will definitely be returning with my family.,1
It was seriously great! I honestly have no complaints. The hotel was wonderful.,1
Great location in the middle of downtown.  Room was also great.,1
Overall great location| room and customer service. Will stay here again next time we're in Chicago. Great value for room including free nreakfast and evening reception.,1
Central location| easy red line transportation| and a social hour Monday thru Thursday that was feeding dinner to families for free!,1
We stayed 2 nights here and it was in a great location. We got there and the valet service helped unload everything| held the doors open for us not just for us but everyone that went in and out of the building and told us where to go check in. The room was very clean and we had a great view. The free breakfast was awesome| it had a variety of everything. The staff was friendly and very helpful to get where we we going using the shuttle and trains.,1
Very expensive parking| very tight sofa bed| breakfast ran out of food,1
Loved the location (in the same building as Eataly)| walking distance to Navy Pier| Millenium Park and the amazing Maggie Daly park for kids. Staff were great| a nice treat to have breakfast included too. Also an almost-full kitchen (no oven but a big fridge with freezer) and a spacious bathroom ensuite. Well laid out to use all the space. Rooftop pool is fun too!,1
You can walk 20 mins to the Navy Pier| or take the trolley!  This hotel is a great location!  We got 2 conjoined rooms and all of the rooms are suites so the space is amazing!  easy to find everything!  pool is nice| no jacuzzi.,1
Love the fact it is located in close proximity to Michigan Ave to shop.  The only complaint was that it seemed to be very chilly in the halls and the room.  No matter how I tried to adjust the thermostat| it would not warm up.,1
Hotel staff was very friendly and kind!!! Room was clean| pool was nice| breakfast was just ok but it was free!  Location was excellent!  Very happy and I'm hard to impress!,1
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.  We arrived Thursday and was very happy with the reception.  The salad| chicken strips| snacks| beer| and wine was soooo appreciated!  The staff were very responsive to our needs.  We couldn't figure the air conditioning out and had to call for help.  An engineer was sent up right away to explain that the air hadn't been turned on yet| but that we could open the windows.  That worked fine| until the street noise got to to be too loud in the middle of the night.  Wasn't very wild about that| but it wasn't miserable.,1
Very nice hotel and great location. Price was just right. Will definitely stay there again. I only wish their bathroom vanity was larger so you could put your toiletries on it.,1
Heidi and Jillian are both wonderful with guests. Very warm and hospitable. Barbara and Elizabeth were so gracious with serving breakfast| which was an incredible value in quality of food and selection. Property really nice and location AWESOME. Right in the heart of the city. Only complaint is the sofa bed. Terribly uncomfortable. All springs and no mattress. Heidi sent multiple pillow toppers which did help some. Overall| great stay.,1
Very straight forward check-in & check-out in safe & secure building. Apartment style room was very clean| well lit| spacious and well maintained with daily housekeeping. The kitchenette is a great facility with a hob| refrigerator| coffee / tea maker| cutlery| pots & pans etc. and good storage for food etc. The hotel is well located with shops for groceries nearby and only a 5 minute walk from Michigan Avenue. Ideal location for visiting the major tourist attractions and the Big Bus Tour have a stop within a 5 minute walk. The red line metro has a stop only a minute walk from the hotel but its location makes it easy to walk anywhere in the city centre. Would highly recommend this hotel and will stay again on my next visit to Chicago.,1
We will definitely return if/when we visit Chicago again!!,1
Our family of 4 had a wonderful stay in Chicago at home wood suites. The breakfast was different each day which was so nice. It was very clean and the location was in the middle of everything we came to visit.,1
We loved our stay here!  We plan on using Homewood Duites again!  Really good location with a lot of great restaurants within walking distance.  The included breakfast was very tasty as well!  We laughed so hard playing at the pool at the end of each day!,1
Nice view| reasonable price.,1
Very nice hotel| just minutes away from shopping and attractions,1
This was the worst hotel I ever been the bathroom was so nasty smells like urine  the shower  was  full with mold  they don't clean the rooms daily you have to call and request cleaning 24 hr before BUT NO ONE TELLS YOU ANYTHING AND WHEN YOU CALL TO REQUEST CLEANING SERVICES OR CLEAN AND DRY TOWELS FRON DESK GOT UPSET AND HE TOLD ME BECAUSE OF COVID 19 THEN THE SUPERVISOR VOLUNTARILY OFFER $50 CORTESY CREDIT AND when we check out THE CREDIT WAS ONLY $20 A JOKE SO WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN THIS IS GOING TO BE SHARE IN SOCIAL MEDIA I WAS IN SAN FRANCISCO 2 WEEKS AGO AT THE HYATT AND IT WAS CLEAN AND THEY MAKe MY ROOM EVERY DAY WITH OUT ME ASKING FOR IT AND THE BATHROOM DID NOT SMELL LIKE URINE  HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!,0
I thought it was a great place to stay for the price and location!,1
Location and cleanliness,1
Hotel stay was great close to almost everything only issue was $50 self parking.,1
Not much,1
The customer service at check-in and checkout was the worst I have ever experienced in my 10 years of being a Hilton Honors member. The staff were rude and impolite for the entire stay| it was absolutely ridiculous. During checkout they tried to charge me for two parking spaces while I repeatedly said I only had one car. I had to ask three times for the copy of the invoice for my second room. Finally| the attendant threw the invoice at me| turned around and started trash talking to the other attendants directly in front of me. Would strongly recommend not booking a stay at this hotel unless you want to be bullied by the staff.,0
We had a great time.  The hotel is right in the middle of everything.  Great access to get anywhere.  The concierge at the front desk was amazing (the gentleman with salt and pepper hair and glasses).. He gave us great directions and helped us find good restaurants to eat and places to shop. When we were going out for an adventure he made sure we had water.  He always greeted us with a wonderful smile and always wished us a good day.  We will be staying here again on our next trip.  Great people all around.,1
Rooms are terrible. Definitely not clean. Tons of dust. If you have any allergies stay away. Hotel is very old. Will never stay again.,0
Great location! Close to Chinatown| North Beach| Financial district and an easy walk to the Ferry Building| and Embarcadero to walk to Pier 39| etc..,1
Great hotel but parking was crazy expensive. We paid $51 to self park!,1
The hotel was close to Chinatown and downtown. Convenient to walk around and check out local foods. Public transit is easy to get. Front of the house and customer care was wonderful. The room was upgraded. Just 2 minor things that was missing. One I wish there was a small refrigerator. 2nd I wanted housekeeping to clean the room. Even though I mentioned it durning my check in. Needless to say it never happened. All in all it was great to stay at the Hilton,1
I enjoyed my stay there.,1
"Room smelled very badly of cigarette smoke (worrying during COVID). Couldn't offer us a room with the same booking criteria (high floor with bay view - didn't offer discount for taking a room without a view of the bay). Sprayed room with room refresher. When the smoke smell persisted we asked for room to be refreshed the next morning and lobby said ""we'll have to see"" if they can do it. Made us doubt the cleanliness of the room during COVID times. Room at end of hall so we could hear elevator ding all night| as well as traffic below (despite being on 16th floor)| and couple above us having sex. Not a restful or enjoyable stay. Many other hotels in the area to choose from. Won't stay with Hilton again and would not recommend anyone else staying here.",0
Need more maintenance on the building| carpet need fix| toilet ruining water noice|,1
Hotel was ok Staff was amazing,1
Horrible stay and rude receptionist,0
Great stay. Room was very clean and had an amazing view of Coit Tower. Full amenities| and appreciate having hair dryer| iron/ironing board already in the room.  Right in the middle of Chinatown and North Beach.  Need to be patient during rush hours for the elevators. Walls are a little thin but they provide a sound machine in the room.,1
Rooms is a bit aged and it's not soundproof| but afterall it's a Hilton and has everything you expected for a hotel. The stay was pretty great and it's a great deal for the price. Really appreciate the cleaning staff for making the old rooms mostly spotless!,1
High-rise building with only 2 elevators in use in the morning rush hour| waited for more than 30 minutes and still could not get down| have to use stairs to get down carrying luggage from 9th floor.,0
The hotel is nice and clean. Parking expensive,1
This comfortable hotel is well situated on the edge of Chinatown and North Beach a few blocks from the Embarcadero.,1
The Hotel was nice| but the walls were super thin. There was loud music all night and I could hear the baby crying all night. I know the baby could not help it. The view was beautiful. Once the city went to sleep it was so peaceful.,1
Love that it's in Chinatown! Great food!,1
There was a dog barking on our floor. The line for the elevator was horrendous. An employee came and took us to the service elevator it was sooo bad. My husband tried to walk up the stairs nd got locked in on the stairway. He and two girls started banging on the door and finally someone came to get them out| he was so scared| it was horrible!|,0
We were able to drop off our luggage early and explore the town. The room was well kept and the staff were really helpful with all of our questions prior to staying.,1
customer service OK no amenities in the rooms like microwave or refrigerator. Positive was smell clean and Covid fre.,1
Our stay was great| friendly and honest staff. My son left his table in the room son we had to go back to see if we could find it| the room was already cleaned but the cleaning lady found it and returned it to me she was very nice and helpful.,1
Staff was so friendly and always helpful.,1
There were many restaurants around here It's really good,1
Beautiful room| amazing view| stellar staff & REALLY comfy beds!!! Slept like a baby.,1
Very convenient for us to go TPI our favorite places from this hotel.,1
Our stay was great! We had an AMAZING view given to us but the only problem with the view is that the windows were extremely dirty :( so you can't get the full view experience. The vending machines steal your money most of the time but the staff was nice enough to give us drinks to replace the money we missed out on. Housekeeping came every day were were there and picked up trash made the bed and replaced towels and we can confidently say the room smelled and looked amazing Everytime we would come back from a long day. Warning: when you pay the deposit you don't get CLOSE to as much as you paid. Our deposit was $200. And I received $90 on the way out. This needs to be fixed or taken care of because a deposit is supposed to be given back in full not half. Overall amazing trip and accommodating staff.,1
Very clean| updated| comfortable and nice view. No free parking| paid extra $40 for parking. No pool or hot tub. No fan in the bathroom. Location is around homeless community.,1
It was a great experience,1
It was okay. Not over the top or failing. I like that parking was included and they had a lot of lobby amenities. However| for the price you pay and room you get I've seen and experienced better. The area wasn't bad and overall we just used it to sleep which it did suit well in that case. However lighting in the bathroom sucks! Had to do my makeup outside near window. I also requested a city view and i got An alley view. Meh.,1
It was ok. Paid for premium view and didn't really get a high floor. Parking is expensive and,1
Very good service,1
Did not like that rooms are older and in need of updates.,1
Wish the bar was fully stocked and the restaurant open since the state has been fully open since 6/15/21. Other than that I had a great stay! I was even upgraded to a better room!,1
Avoid this property.,0
The staff was excellent and very friendly,1
It is overall a good hotel. I like that it is close to a BART station.,1
The location is convenient to North Beach and has considerably fewer homeless and drug users than other areas. We found it very walkable and safe.,1
I don't have any complaints about that Hilton. I just didn't like parking at the hotel for $45 at night it should be included in the price. Please make some changes.,1
I don't recommend you stay at this time until there is a mandate to wear a mask in order to get in the elevators.  We got out several times because there were more than 10 people in the elevator not wearing a mask and regardless what the government says we are still not free and out of the pandemic. This is a place we're people from all over the world come to stay of all ages. Are they all vaccinated?  NO,1
The only complaint that I had was that there were some stained up bath towels on my second night there that I had to notify them about. Other than that| the check in clerk Carlos Andre was amazing day in & day out. He was very helpful & resourceful. He also had a great attitude & provided great customer service the entire time.,1
It was great experience,1
Staff at check in was very friendly and helpful. View from our room was fantastic!,1
Excellent!!! Everything was as you would expect from a 5 star hotel. The Hilton Financial District is extraordinarily classy| fancy and even though it was post pandemic I was wowed. Feel comfortable staying at the Hilton. They wash their hands! Lol,1
It has a good location.,0
No valet parking| no restaurant| coffee shop did not open until 6:30AM| will not stay at that hotel anymore.,0
The room was decent. Elevators are horrible! Took 30 minutes to finally get down to the lobby. I would not recommend staying here for that reason.,0
Hotel was in the financial district right near north beach. Seemed a little run down. Walls were thin and heard a lot of noise. But overall fine. The parking fee is $45 a night which we didn't see online so beware of that.,1
Overall this has been a crazy / not good experience staying at the Hilton San Francisco Financial District on Kearny-,0
Beautiful hotel. Everything was nice and clean.,1
Number 1 I don't like because people stay in the hotel is like homeless people|plus number the one I hate dogs a lot of dogs stays in the hotel the room make stinky and nasty because of dogs| and very noise even people is in the other room still you hear them,0
This hotel is pretty over priced for what it offers. Parking was very expensive for a weeknight and there were little to no amenities. And the elevators were very slow and frustrating. Would reconsider staying here next time because of price.,0
I was very pleased with the overall service at the Hilton Hotel. The hotel was consistently clean and there was always help available. Additionally| i appreciated their food service down in the lobby. The views were spectacular as well.,1
Was not given all the information about amenities and our room was not cleaned daily.,1
This hotel is located in a great spot to see many things in San Francisco.  Parking is on site but $51.30 daily.  Everything was clean and updated| good views| but no housekeeping.  However we were able to get anything we needed and it was delivered to our room in a timely manner.  We would definitely return to this hotel.,1
Is so crowded when people is checking out and the elevator it was so busy| we had to wait almost 20 minutes.,0
Hotel was In great location. We walked all over Chinatown one night and to pier 39 the next day. The room was adequate. I paid for a bay view| but the window was so dirty and the bay was on the far right so it wasn't worth the extra money. We needed extra towels and coffee and they were very prompt.,1
Its very well kept good pricing,1
Overnight stay. Staff were helpful and nice. Near Chinatown.  Actually went bakery hopping. Comfy bed. City view. Will stay again.,1
I didn't have enough towels in the room. I twice asked for towels to be provided and I didn't get any in my room. I waited to take my shower and no one brought them. I went to the reception to ask again and they informed me that they would deliver it to my room| but unfortunately nobody brought my towels. I had to dry my body with my own clothes because there was no towels!! Also| there was no possibility to park the car anywhere. I was not informed on the website that I would have to pay for parking. I was surprised when I had to pay a huge extra amount to park my car without having another parking option. Also when I came back to the hotel the entrance to the garage was blocked with a lot of people watching the fireworks and there was no one to tell the people they can not be there because the cars has to go to the garage. I spent 2 HOURS waiting to go inside to the hotel that I paid for! So frustrating! So disappointed! Worst experience! Ruined my trip!,0
It was in the best location for fireworks,1
The room and the hotel was good but there was no room cleaning service during the 8 days we stayed.  Not sure if it was COVID related but it did not felt right to not have room or bathroom cleaned  during this long stay. I received just 1 change of towels,1
The Hilton was perfect! We stayed in a great location| walking distance to Chinatown| great restaurants| and got to see awesome architectural designs in the cityscape.,1
I like this property was very clean,1
We had a two queen bedroom with no clean towel and a tiny room| and when we asked the cleaning lady to have a towel| she ignored us and finally talked to the front desk about that. They charge us over 50 dollars for parking for each night which did not mention on hotel's website. The area around was not a good area too. I do not recommend it to anybody.,0
No room service| no house keeping| no anything. You might as well stay at a motel 6. You'll probably be treated better. I wasn't informed anywhere that the hotel is running at a bare minimum. It was sad because I love this hotel. It's lack of communication on purpose or otherwise is destroying its reputation,0
Hotel is conveniently located near the waterfront and lots of Chinese restaurants.  Rooms could use some updating.  Restaurant is closed on site which can be an issue with breakfast.  All in all| no major complaints.,1
I like that they are safe to park your car but $45 for every night is a bit expensive for my liking,1
Good location -- very close to Chinatown. If you need to be somewhere at a certain time| plan accordingly their elevator is SLOW!! We waited 10 minutes for the elevator to actually get to us.,1
Was close to where we needed to go,1
The front desk associate| Jeffrey was very pleasant. Although our room door failed to open because of the door battery (we learned later) and maintenance fixed it eventually| we waited too long for the maintenance guy to get up. I suggest maintenance should check the door battery regularly and not wait for guests to report it. The inconvenience of waiting for the repair was not good. I appreciate that the front desk associate gave us a credit for the inconvenience without my asking upon out.,1
The location was so convenient to areas we wanted to see. It was perfect.,1
Hotel was nice. Only problem coffee maker in room didn't work and there wasn't a microwave in the room. Continental breakfast would be a plus to have.,1
It was great! Will come back here again,1
It was cheaper than others hotels in the area  two month earlier we stayed at the park central hotel which we liked a lot more but overall it was nice towe just used it to sleep and shower anyway,1
Great hotel location and awesome city stay.,1
Water machines were down| so the hotel provided water bottles throughout our stay. Staff was also friendly and accommodating. I have never stayed in a hotel that did not switch out towels and make the beds daily| so that was a surprise. Also| for a hotel with the name Hilton| I would i expected it to be more cleanly; carpets and walls are stained.,1
The property is definitely on the old side| which explains why the rate was reasonable compared to very high rates around the rest of the city during this weekend. The walls are paper thin and I heard every noise and conversation in the next room. However| the central location served me and my family well during our stay. The rooms were very clean and nicely appointed. There are white noise machines in the rooms which helps a lot for sleeping. The staff was also very nice and helpful. Using lobby computers to print things I needed was also easy and helpful.,1
Great location! If you don't mind walking a little it's walking distance to mostly everything. Would highly recommend,1
The room and price is good just the parking i thing is expensive,1
Very nice and right across the street from Chinatown! Room on the 12th floor had a great city view.,1
Our stay in this hotel was great!! Very good location.. Friendly staff and everything clean. We would stay again and we fully recommend thus hotel,1
Staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Hotel room was clean and had a great view of the city. I will definitely be staying here when ever i come to San Francisco,1
Ice machine on my floor brokenNo laundry facilitiesParking for the guests is 45.00 per night| while 29.00 for non guests,0
I arrived very late due to airport delay| but was able to do online check-in with no problem. The room was clean and bed was very comfortable.We had a bay view and were pleased with the location. Obviously not all restaurants were open in the area| due to Covid so we had to walk a bit but I enjoyed the location. Would stay again and recommend to friends.,1
The hotel rooms walls are to thin!!!  There was no in house restaurant available.. which was not advertised on your website Expedia!,0
Hidden fees and price-hiking everywhere. A room at the Hilton is significantly more expensive than air bnbs in the area| so when you book a room you'd expect some luxury. First hidden fees is parking. It's expected when you book a room at a hotel parking is included| nope| they slapped on a 45$ per night charge. The vending machines show one price and then add tax once paid for. There are bottles of water in the room| in Air bnbs these are almost always free| at the Hilton a single bottle of water will run you $8. Just a blatant scam.The room had no mini-fridge or microwave. The TV was a smart tv with only Netflix and showtime| didn't let us even buy a show on Amazon. This place is a scam| don't waste your time or money.,0
The staff was very clear about the accommodations and restrictions due to COVID protocols and were very friendly and professional. Checking in and out was very easy and we had a wonderful weekend in the city.,1
The overall theme and friendliness of the place and staff was hospitable. The only complain would be not having a microwave accessible and the area but for the most part it's a lovely hotel.,1
the view from the room was amazing,1
Property's location is excellent and great service. I stayed 8-9 days no house keeping was provided. Not many restaurants were open due to covid.,1
Elevator issues| poor location.,0
I had a not very pleasant experience| they put me in a tiny room next to the elevator| every time the elevator was used ie all the time| horrible sound and the walls vibrating| impossible to sleep| in the reception ( front desk) a horrible old dirty carpet,0
The view from the 24th floor was amazing! One of the best views of Alcatraz| Coit tower| and the pier. The room itself is outdated| definitely needed a window that opens up to let in some fresh air.,1
the staff were very rude|I mean they seemed that are not willing to help. I understand restrictions about covid19 but there are ways to treat and make guests understand them.you can tell in their faces that they are not even trying.so dissaponting for a HILTON visitors like meand carpet had stains everywhere|very diry for a Hilton,0
the staff were very rude|I mean they seemed that are not willing to help. I understand restrictions about covid19 but there are ways to treat and make guests understand them.you can tell in their faces that they are not even trying.so dissaponting for a HILTON visitors like me,0
Comfortable| Safe and easy access  for all important places.,1
The room was dusty and had a very strong smell of dirtiness.,1
Great location. In walking distance to tons of restaurants and bars. Easily accessible. Our room was clean and neat. Desk staff was very friendly and helpful. Will definitely stay again.,1
My stay was good. Costumer service was amazing. It was clean and comfortable. The elevators though !!!! Takes forrrreverrrr to get somewhere. Every time I would take the elevator I would have to wait like 10+ minutes to get somewhere! But overall I enjoyed my stay :),1
Very nice over there,1
Our room view was disappointing but the room was clean and beds were comfortable. The bathroom floor was in need of repair and needs a deep cleaning of the tile grout in the shower. No ventilation in the bathroom for the shower steam but great water pressure and temperature. The staff were all friendly. The location was in the heart of Chinatown which turned out to be very nice. The locals were kind and the homeless in that area didn't bother us like they did in some of the other areas.,1
Parking was a little confusing| very small right space and Maps brought us in at a strange entrance. Lobby and Front Desk was nice| however I only reserved for a 1 night| 1 Room - Double/ two bed for $187 (roughly). The man gave me cards for two separate rooms for $193 each! which got fixed up quickly| but don't know why 2 rooms were reserved. Elevator| hallways and bedrooms were great and clean! Got a fantastic view of Coit Tower. Bathroom smelt a little of cleaning supplies but everything else was good besides a broken fixture. It was me and my friends first time booking a hotel in the city so it's all learning experience. Elevators recquired key card| alongside lobby restrooms. Parking is additional $42 for us that night. Overall a pretty good/decent stay!,0
Really love the view. Although| the building is older it was well kept. Fast and great service.,1
This Hilton hotel property has great rooms with great views and it also has rooms that are average| i have stayed at this hilton property 3 times and this stay for memorial day werkend was not so pleasant|  the room had a foul smell| and the couch set was stained real bad| no bath robes| carpet was stained and smelled foul. The linens on the beds were dingy and the comforters definently need to be replaced| shower curtain was just ok. As i said at the beginning of this comment some rooms are great and some are well ok| i guess Good Luck on the room lottery.,1
Stay was great! I highly recommend this hotel to anyone!,1
Clean| friendly| real nice rooms with a view. We stayed in room 2623,1
I found sticky goo- almost like old jam- around,0
Shower curtain smelled like a wet dog| walls were very thin| people threw parties in the room early morning| people smoked weed| and cleaning staff were rude.,0
I liked how the staff was very friendly and ready to assist us. Getting to parking| taking our luggage| checking in| and checking out was a breeze.,1
Very clean safe hotel. We stay here often| quick check in great affordable parking.  Wish that the fitness center were open but I know it eventually will be.,1
The location is great!If you rent a car - parking is expensive w/ very little spaces and turns. Rent a small car.,1
It's was a good and pleasing stay!,1
Great location. Very clean and respectful of COVID-19 concerns.,1
It was nice to stay here,1
It was ok but there was no hot breakfast and parking was outrageous,1
Quick check-in| efficient and friendly staff. Room was very clean and comfortable. Would highly recommend!,1
Nice hotel with lots of great restaurants and bars within walking distance,1
"Hotel was very clean and staff was really friendly. We stayed right next to the elevator and could hear when ""loud"" people would come and go but it was no big deal. The stay was great!",1
This is a run down hotel. Hilton should take their name off of it. It's beat down. Dirty sofa in room. Carpets not clean| Windows dirty. It seems like an ill maintained aging hotel. I didn't expect that from Hilton brand. The whole vibe was like a former nice hotel that is falling into disrepair.,0
The location is good but was disappointed that there was no refrigerator and microwave. What i hated most was the noise| i can hear the laughter of the other room. Worst was we were waken up at 6 am because the wall on our head board was shaking and we can hear a lady moaning!that was,0
it was a crowded hotel.  the room has no service and no breakfast- parking expensive rooms smelled bad no one come to clean,0
the room they give the carpet old and dirty | bath room no air extractor | the bed sheet with blood stain | no cable tv .I understand is the pandemic and the reception told to ask for some things for seven days they didn't fix the beds |and them   you have to ask for towels | toilet paper | soap and shampoo Don't think so,0
No room service. Plugs broken- fried by hair styler| yogurt with mold!!!,0
Service,1
It was a nice and clean hotel they were under covid guidelines where they didn't clean the room everyday so you would have to call for new towels everyday but thats minor issues. Great place to stay!,1
Overall nice price and location.,1
No pool| no hot tub| no daily house keeping. The room is not 100% clean or turned over by the house keeping prior to our stay|  because we found other guest shirt on the floor| next to a chair.,1
This hotel is awful. The Hilton had gone down totally in quality. There were stains on the chairs in the room. The hallway carpets are awful. I will never stay at Hilton again.,0
The hotel itself was very pleasing overall. The only minor drawbacks was the slow elevator and thin walls. I would still come back here again!,1
Diana at the front desk was awesome with that early check in.,1
While this was a comfortable and uneventful stay| there wasn't anything special about this hotel.,1
I was a little hesitant on booking this hotel because of being in the financial district and being a solo female traveler. I'm so happy I stayed here! The staff was super friendly| rooms were clean and big and super comfy| it's right on the cusp of north beach and China town (all walking distance) which was perfect for me! Also| there was street parking at night outside the hotel. Will definitely stay here for my next visit. There's a beautiful bar in the hotel and a cool hang out room with a big screen.,1
Water pressure was very low for one an just the way the room smelled. No fridge or microwave FYI,0
Awesome place to stay. We right across the street from China town and 3 blocks away from north beach. Lots of options to see and do. Room was amazing! Beautiful views of the bay front|  coit tower and Alcatraz. Would definitely stay here again.,1
Friendly staff| reasonable price| convenient location for touring around San Francisco.  Our room on the 21st floor offered stunning views of Coit Tower and the bay.Some amenities were not available due to covid but overall| the hotel was excellent.,1
Great location / safe area.  Room was small but had an incredible view.  Staff was very friendly.  We had a great stay and would recommend it for anyone visiting SF.,1
It was a good stay this time around. At least there was a bell boy this time and the bar was actually opened. It does suck tjay housekeeping can't clean your room until you actually check out. Also parking is just ridiculous honestly $36 extra a night.,1
There was beer cans all over the hall way. Used face masks on the elevator floor. The 7th floor corridor| where the vending machines were| was leaking water so there was wet towels on the floor all the time. The room was extremely noisy.,0
Very beautiful view nice location,1
I was not happy with how terrible the water pressure in the shower was. The sink had better water pressure which was very odd. Also did not like how expensive the parking was and was a little upset the parking was not included in the price.,0
The view I loved!  Didn't like noisey  guests next door to me!,1
Everything was good except the wall are thin and you can hear the other room other than that I will be back,1
We stayed for 4 nights and it was a great stay. Clean| friendly staff| and great location.,1
The air conditioning system would not work sometimes|,0
Good location but old dirty hotel.,0
We could even get our room cleaned I really don't like the fact that we had to use a dirty bathroom and sleep on dirty sheets,0
Location is convenient,1
Stayed for one night and enjoyed our time there. Room was clean and comfortable. If we ever need to head back that way we will definitely book there again. Location was about a 10 min walk from Bart.,1
You rip offs I cancelled on the 26 the an hour after I made it | what the hell is going on? Where's my refund?üò£,0
Anthony was so friendly and he assisted me during checked in. The place is very clean. From the lobby to the room it smells so good. Will probably stay there again when I come back.,1
Love the area! Wish parking was a little cheaper| around $35 for parking. The staff were friendly and helpful.,1
Location and surrounding restaurants. Nice staff,1
Bathroom was terrible| shower water was flowing out. Every-time we took a bath| the bathroom floor was all wet. No refrigerator in room| bathroom door kept dislocating| less number of power sockets. Overall property condition was not on par. For parking charges| we ended up paying double the amount than promised over call. Huge miscommunication on their part. I have used multiple hilton properties| this is the first time I would not recommend anyone. Location was great. Everything is walkable. And I like the TV screen.,0
I was very pleased with our stay. Great rate| good location| friendly staff and a clean and comfortable room.,1
This has got to be the worst stay in a hotel ever.  When booking in Expedia| it is described that there is concierge and luggage storage service.  Infact| there is not.  When I complained to the manager| he kicked us out.  I told him it was not 11am| so we would stay until our checkout time.  Staff are not only unhelpful| but are outright rude.  We will never frequent this hotel chain again.,0
We stayed for 2 nights and it was a very pleasant experience. The hotel was clean and took all the precautions. This was our first time staying on this side of the city and it was conveniently located next to Chinatown and the Financial District. Would stay here again.,1
Very nice staff| front desk persons was very polite and helpful. Overall a really nice stay.,1
The area that the hotel is located was very nice and had a really nice view.,1
Due to Covid| the elevators were limited to 4 people per elevator.  After waiting on the 12th floor for 20 minutes| we were still unable to get a elevator.  Walked down 12 floors of stairs.  Staff should have opened staff elevators to decrease the congestion.,1
Loved the location.,1
The views at night are amazing from this location. The staff was really good at making the most of our stay,1
Expedia was careless in how you made my reservation at the Hilton| such that you got my name wrong| and it took 10 minutes when I was checking in to sort this out.,0
The staff was outstanding our entire stay. The policy of no longer storing baggage for guests resulted in ruining our entire last day if our trip. We checked out at noon but our flight wasn't departing until 7PM| so having to keep our bags with us for the entire day made it to where we had to sit in the lounge with no services at the hotel. The room with 16 screens on the wall wasn't even tuned to any TV channel so sitting there fir hours without even a drink available is very poor service. While it is not the staff's fault| it is management making these decisions that should create an alternative or at minimum notify guests of this lack of service upon checkin.,1
The customer service of this place was amazing! Everyone was so helpful and friendly and the views were exquisite! Would book this place again!,1
Staying here with our 4 kids in a few rooms proved to be very nice as the staff was very helpful and connected two of our rooms and provided us feedback on Chinatown. The rooms are very clean and the hotel is got a great location,1
Sheets were dirty| thin walls| really loud| & front desk was rude.,0
I did not like staying at this property,0
I only wish we could have checked our luggage for a few extra hours since our flight was much later. But|i understand because of covid- not putting all the luggage together. Its the perfect stay for people  to go to the VFS appointments. All of the employees were the best. The cleaning staff was amazing too!,1
Old buildingsNo hot water Dirty bathtubs| toilets I've machines barely had ice,0
Great and friendly staff really helped out. The room was clean and organized| very nice.,1
Very nice and comfortable stay.,1
Covid free & Clean hotel and great location! Our room faced the city and although the windows were due for a cleaning| we got amazing views.We rented bikes for two days and the hotel let us bring them into our room overnight. So nice of them. The facilities were closed| bummer. However| the bar downstairs was opened.,1
The elevators are limited so the wait time on them is super long had to use the stairs couple of times.,1
Property was in a great location and the staff was very helpful. Check in was quick and easy. Expect to pay for parking when your anywhere in San Francisco.,1
Everything was great| definitely recommend!,1
Dirty hotel and room | no daily service| no fridge in room in a 5 star hotel | no tooth brush | no tooth paste .,0
Love that the hotel was close to everything and walking distance.,1
Beautiful room overlooking the bay. Comfortable beds. Great bathroom. Fast elevators. Beautiful lobby,1
Overall our stay was good.  The only issue was that the bathtub looked dirty.,1
Shout out to awesome Dani! The only person w a great attitude. All other folks at front desk were on Their cell phones. Not motivated to help. Horrible elevators- 20 minutes in line waiting. Wonderful housekeeping. Parking and elevators plus lack of service mean I won't be back,0
The staff was very friendly and the rooms were very comfy and clean,1
All excellent considering the circumstances. Maybe the only unfortunate event was the time the elevators took for 4 person maximum. Our room had a view of coot tower. It was quiet and a great location in my opinion.,1
My stay was great. Hotel was clean and the location was the best ever for the price.,1
The place is run down inside and out. Very loud at night. Parties,0
No amenities at this time due to Covid.,1
Before you book| think twice!!I thought the Hilton name guaranteed a certain standard when it comes to hotels| I was wrong.-Rude Staff at check in- No ability to pay with Apple Pay/ contactless- Facilities are dated and in need of renovations- Elevators crowded and take forever- Bathtub easily overflows and spills water everywhere- On a positive note| the location is acceptable| but there are other hotels in the area. Avoid this one.,0
Hard to find options for stairs when theres a bunch of people waiting for elevator with limited capacity. Room smells like someone smoke on it (maybe I accidentally booked a smoking room even if I tried to make sure I did not). No fridge and microwave in room unfortunately. Room does not get cool enough even if  I lowered temperature as low as we can (might get fix if I complain but only stayed 2 nights that we did not want to be too demanding) Staff were nice though. Overall - its ok. Close to everything I which is great,0
I really liked taking the elevator to the 3rd floor and walking across the bridge to the park,1
Stay was good until we accidentally left multiple xbox games in the room and when we called house keeping they told us they weren't there . I'm 100% sure that house keeping stole my stuff which is very sad considering how much i paid to stay here .,1
Was not the experience I was expecting. The outdated rooms was a NO for me.,0
Some of the pillow cases weren't that clean. Water in the room was 8$ for a bottle. The elevators took at least 18min one of the Parking garage entrances was closed and staff didn't let people know.,0
I really liked where it's located. It's not too far from fisherman wharf and China town. I didn't like how crowded it was. The rooms are good but they need to be updated. I didn't have room service the 2 days I stayed. I did saw other having room service so I'm not sure why they told me since I checked in that I wasn't going to have. Overall I like it.,1
Ice machine didn't work at 19 floor and we have to going to another's floors to get it,1
I didn't like that the parking was an additional $30 a night. Also the elevator system was ridiculous. 2 Elevators for 27 floors and only able to have 4 people in at a time was a nightmare,1
Way over priced parking Staff was rude Staff tried to get into room while we were changing and it wasnt even our check out time,0
Place is very nice well located in middle of China Town easily waking distance to Italian  town and ferry dock,1
The noise from the next room reached me.But. it is very satisfying to pay attention to disinfection.,1
The Hilton did not meet my expectations at all first the parking wasn't free for guests which I think should be after payin for this hotel then there was no frigid in the room the WiFi cost money ridiculous after the 2nd nite out of a 3 nite stay the tv stopped working bad hotel overall won't stay again,0
The hotel was in a nice area. What I didn't like was when we arrived they started by telling us what was not available. No house keeping or cleaning of the room. if we needed new towels we could get them from the front desk. No room service| restaurant  or bar service the gym was closed. The day before leaving i was informed they did not have a shuttle service to the airport| this cost me another 50.00. with all the changes we did not get a reduced rate.,0
Hotel had no microwave that was not a good look...,1
Great stay. Clean| friendly service| easy check in. Room was as advertised and location of hotel was great,1
The Hilton was close to historic Chinatown but the hotel site was run down.  They had to move my room because it had severe black mold and I'm worried i will end up sick because of it.,0
Close to Chinatown and Union Square was only about 10 minute walk and Fishermen's Wharf was about a 30 minute walk,1
Very clean and friendly staff! In a great location,1
Room has no microwave and fridge. I didn't get room service or anything besides free WiFi. Never got my room cleaned or sheets swapped out.Hotel meeting spots are full/closed/overbooked,0
Great experience very organize clean and sanitized,1
I liked the garage but I wish it were made clearer where the elevators were located!,1
The stay was wonderful| overall there were very little services due to Covid.  Otherwise I would have rated it higher.  There was no note of the cost of parking or I missed it.,1
Due to covid| all onsite food and beverage outlets are closed.  Room attendant service by request only.  Lots of hand sanitizer stations.  Social distancing marked.  Staff very friendly accommodating| offered upgrade and late checkout.  Room was spacious with gorgeous bay view.  Location perfect walking distance to Chinatown and North Beach.  Lots of restaurants offer outdoor seating dining.,1
Amazing staff| very friendly and welcoming!! Great location!!,1
Good location| beautifully updated rooms| and we even got a free upgrade!,1
Great hotel i will definitely recommend it. The view is excellent| location is great.,1
Friendly staff and good location. We enjoyed our stay.,1
I really hate when staff thinks they are better / higher class than us customers I will never go back to this place,0
The hotel was noisy| not well cleaned and the mattress was very old.,1
The only thing I feel the rooms are missing is a microwave and mini fridge. Other than that everything is great.,1
Bay view more like roofs view| overpriced water| no refrigerator| parking was nit included $35| wifi was not included $15| filthy.,0
Great location with lots of food choices and shopping within walking distance.,1
Ivan at the front desk was amazing. Very kind and helpful.,1
Location was good | hotel was clean ..| overall a great stay,1
Nothing was unique worst place ever won't be staying here never again,0
Overall| a very decent quality room hotel with a bay view reasonably price,1
Perfect location| clean and tasteful decor| and the staff is friendly and helpful,1
Parking no good because I have to paid 30 dlls for 2 day,1
Great stay visiting San Francisco. A little different than we'd like but overall nice,1
The property was nice. Due to covid there were no amenities available. Parking had a height limit| so we parked in front of location bu the curb.,1
Nice people| and most importantly the bed was comfy| nice tv| pretty clean. However the room was definitely dated. The bathroom floor wasn't clean| and the electronic curtains were pretty messed up.,1
Nice room but no amenities like a fridge or microwave. No fan in bathroom either| so the steam from the shower has no place to go. Lovely view. Elevators| lobby and guest services 5 stars. Rooms 4 stars.,1
This was the most disgusting hotel I have ever stayed in. I booked a 'hilton' because it's reputation is that of a certain level of standard but I might as well have stayed in a motel down the road. The rooms and hallways were dirty with stains everywhere and smells of cigarettes| the people in the room next to me were throwing a party during covid lockdown - I had to change rooms 3 times in 2 days and ultimately left before my stay was over because anything else was better than this hotel. I will NEVER stay in a hilton again and will make sure anyone I know coming to the bay area avoids this hotel at any cost.,0
Great room and excellent staff! Will book again in the future,1
Desk agents  were very blunt and rude| there were no refrigerator or micro wave in the room although other hotels are allowed to have them even during covid,0
Very nice staff and excellent service. Clean room. Overall nothing bad to say.,1
The bed was so comfortable and clean and the room was clean and cozy.,1
It's a great place to get some RnR. Right on the out skirts of Chinatown so great food around,1
I've stayed in this hotel two times already. Both during covid so nothing was open. When it's really busy in the hotel| it can take between 5-10 minutes for an elevator. But| this time it was almost immediate. :) I never had a bad experience with the staff and for the price| this is a really nice hotel. And in saying all this.. I really like the hotel as I said  but| please... does it hurt to wash the windows? üòÖ,1
Great hotel with great staff! Walking distance to pretty much everything my husband and I wanted to see. Great views and Ivan| thank you for your help!,1
Manger was really rude Ivan was cool but the rest of the front desk was rude,0
It was always enjoyable at the Hilton. Even though we didn't have housecleaning service they were always available to give us clean towels,1
First time staying there. Always stayed at the one on O'farrell. Loved it nice area.,1
My stay was amazing the employees were beyond nice| next to China town had an overall great experience will be coming back,1
No amenities were available which is understandable during COVID. However I called three days prior to ensure that they could store our luggage at concierge after check out so we could sight see until our flight later that night. The staff member on the phone said that we could| however the day of| we were told that they do not store luggage and we were stuck taking our luggage all around the city that day. The front desk worker didn't seem to care about our situation and,0
It was so amazing! The hotel is so big Nd has a lot to do just in the hotel. I would start again most definitely.,1
it was great with a nice view,1
Close to Chinatown| and bridges...My Rebequita ‚ù§ loved San Francisco...,1
You should not charge for parking. That was stupid. My guest had to pay for his car to be parked. We already are paying high fees.,1
Amazing view and lots to do near by,1
Excellent hotel! ... location close to everything...,1
It was nice a good view but would be much better if the windows were clean,1
No cleaning service at room| Windows to dirty couldnt enjoyed the awesome view,1
Near to China town & a lot of restuarant | But the bathtub is molding.,1
Nice hotel. Room was clean for the most part but still could be cleaned a bit more. One of the beds was broken. They allowed us to check in early and check out late because of flight times which was nice.,1
Loved my stay here,1
The hotel was awesome.  I will definitely be staying here the next time in in San Fran.  The bay view room I had was on the 23rd floor and the view was spectacular.,1
Hotel is centrally located within walking distance to China town and pier 39.  I recommend this hotel to anyone staying in San Francisco and does not want to drive around,1
I got switched to 3 different rooms and none of them had AC. They said they had over 34 rooms with no AC. My son has asthma so I couldn't wait to check out. Felt like we were sleeping in a stuffy ass closet,0
Staff are very rude not helpful| needs more training for customer service| ruined our trip because of their attitude we did not enjoy| terrible parking garage| very inconvenient.,0
Pretty good hotel! Although it looked like the floor we were on was under construction for paint repair| it was no bother to us. Amenities were closed due to Covid. There's a big TV in the bedroom which was really nice and it was spacious and clean! The only bother we had was the long time we had to endure coming back at night to get on the elevator. It wasn't terrible| but after a long day of walking it was just time consuming. It was right in the middle of Chinatown and honestly a great location for wherever you want to go in San Fran!,1
Everything was good!!Dont like they charge 30 a night for parking. Thankful the manager gave up 15 dollars a night,1
I checked in to this hotel and it was not what was promised at booking. Not only did it say I would get a room with a view that had a picture of the ocean view| I have a view of China town. Your website also did not mention the parking fee| or the fact that this hotel is still under quarantine and does not offer room service| maid service| and all bars and restaurants in this establishment are still closed due to covid. I checked in my room and the bathroom is filthy and I found clothing articles from a previous guest at the top of the closet!!! Upon returning to the room from dinner| the AC unit was left on to cool the very hot room off while we were enjoying dinner| it was and still is extremely hot. At this point I have had enough and I have contacted the hotel and a gentlemen was very attentive and sent a fan to my room but was unable to credit me due to my booking with you. I am extremely disappointed| this is my worst hotel stay ever. I had higher hopes with this being the Hilton. I also contacted hotels.com and the representative was very rude and unwillingly to try and resolve the problems. The only thing he said he would do was if i left then and there they would give me a full refund. I declined due to the fact that it qas 9pm and i drove 2 hours to get there. I suggested leave the next morning with a 1 night refund and that was declined. I then asked to speak to his supervisor and the chat abruptly ended without any resolution.,0
Staff was helpful and friendly. They explained all the charges and parking costs up front. The room was slightly dirty. Hair in the tub and a plastic bag wrapping my fire alarm.Great location| everything is close by. Parking is great and not that expensive.,1
The entertainment room that allowed us to hang out while we waited for our delayed flight. I didnt like that i was told due to covid they cant hold personal belongings| then said it was due to space. I was given the run around about late check out fee. Did not accomadate me as a guest.,0
We enjoyed our 4 night stay with them.  Nothing in the hotel was open due to covid| but they still sold beer|  wine| sodas and snacks.   Near a Starbucks and some really good local restaurants.  Room was small but comfortable.  View was beautiful.  Their is an amazing Italian restaurant a street over called  Magia Tutti which is a hidden treasure!,1
The property was very outdated. Couch in room was filthy dirty| floor in bathroom very old and rusty. Very noisy hotel. You can hear through the walls through the door couldn't sleep. Had such a bad night sleep or lack of sleep that we had to check out and switch hotels.,0
Overall it's a nice a hotel for the price (esp right now with covid). Location is great!! The hotel rooms can use some reno and updating like the walls were pretty thin and elevator was very inefficient. Elevator sign says only 2 ppl at a time| it would stop by a lot of floors before reaching to the level you want and sometimes the elevator would just go up without you being able to press the number and then have to wait to come back down.,1
The location is perfect for walking at any angle is all literally close by| the staff is friendly,1
"The hotel room itself was fine| but none of the staff cares about COVID. They allow guests to roam around the lobby/hallways and enter elevators without a mask. There's a security guard at the door| but they never enforced anything. Additionally| they have a 2 person per elevator ""rule"" that was never observed. Guests would barge into elevators with 6+ people| many of them without masks. Overall a pretty disappointing and scary experience as a first time traveler during this COVID pandemic. I'm pretty sure the way this Hilton is operating during COVID isn't legal.",0
Trip to San Francisco| big place kinda in the Financial district and outskirts of Chinatown Too bad the pandemic is on would of liked to walk a bit of Chinatown,1
The single worst stay at a Hilton I've ever been at. The staff was rude... they decided to charge $68 for parking when we spoke to a worker there before we booked and asked and they said they had free parking. For that price we could've stayed right by the pier. Not worth the price at all.,0
It was very pleasing| comfortable and relaxing,1
Everthing is nice clean just the elevators are slow but understand,1
Junkies everywhere| people walking around with no masks| dirty| needed to change rooms because the noise| would never stay at this Hilton again| major disappointment.,0
I loved my stay at the Hilton| stayed for 3 nights and i can say everything was great from checking in and checking out. The only thing i will complain about is the elevator wait time | the line gets so long and you have to wait to get into an elevator. Other than that it was an amazing stay! Pamela at the front counter is great help! She definitely made us feel welcomed. Will be back soon!,1
Great customer service and wonderful location! Safe parking and beautiful hotel! New favorite place!‚ù§Ô∏è,1
The stay was great staff courteous room and overall facility spotless clean very quiet my only issue which I reported was the housekeeper walked in on us on two separate occasions two different days  other than that I had  no problem and will visit again,1
They didn't explain how to use the room key to get out of the garage so I never knew how to use it and paid double for the parking,0
Location was what we expected| service was mediocre. We had a nice view too bad the windows were dirty. Paying for parking which is expected but  no room service available was not a good experience,0
Kinda sucked overall..,0
Great staff| clean rooms and walking distance to many restaurants,1
Staff was very friendly and helpful| I'll be happy to come back and stay again,1
Pot smoking people in Lobby| clientele has changed for the worse and poor management which is allowing the Hilton Brand to suffer tremendously,0
The property is in a convenient location for tourism of the downtown areas Which is a plus. However| the parking garage are in the lower basement for hotel guests and there's a heavy odor of gas/exhaust that is nauseating. The hotel does not offer housekeeping services until checkout due to Covid which is unacceptable. There were trash left in the hallways from hotel guests for housekeeping to pickup that stayed there the whole 4 days we were there. The rates should be reduced to lower rates if guests are not receiving clean sheets and housekeeping services during their entire stay.,0
Staff| location| views from the room. Felt safe visiting and staying even during covid times,1
Nice hotel at a fair price and great location downtown. Be prepared to pay for parking $60+ a night. Or parking directly across is half the price. They| hotel| also charges extra $50 for whatever fees...not sure| but overall enjoyed our stay.,1
Nice and clean city view ‚ù§Ô∏è,1
Very good hotel| very clean and very nice| people that work there are also very nice.. really good spot to stay at ..,1
It was ok. Not the best experience but not the worse. Just meh. Our first room smelled like cigarettes so bad and we had littles aged 5 and 7. The hotel staff was very nice and quickly moved us into a room without stink.,1
It was a smooth check in process| staff was really nice made everything quick & easy to get to my room!,1
Hotel Service was Good! Rooms are Clean| Parking is $34 at hotel| Due to Covid19 you cant use the elevator properly just 2 people at a time. Other then that stay was nice.,1
No valet - have to park underground in a shady parking garage. Restaurant/bar in lobby was closed due to COVID despite there being at least one hotel right down the street that had their restaraunt open for take out. Also no room service or daily housekeeping again due to COVID| despite that same hotel down the street offering these options.,0
Great just parking is narrow when go in and out,1
Good check in . They have done Covid safety measures,1
The pillows did not smell clean. The parking was expensive as well.,0
It was an overall satisfactory experience! Helpful staff but our floor was pretty dirty.,1
Very clean hotel with air conditioning. Because of the pandemic there was no breakfast available. But that ok.  The hotel is pet friendly for $75 fee,1
It was a good Stay but finding like the fact that there was no drinking water in the room.:/ we had to find a nearby store. But everything else was really good,1
unforgettable bay view room.Room floor carpet was torn in area.No fridge on premium double bed or king bed room.,1
The hotel is in a great location in SF's financial district and right next to China Town. I would've preferred to have a fridge in the room| but other than that the room was comfortable. Because only two people are allowed in an elevator at a time| be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes in the busier afternoon. It was just a little inconvenient| not enough to complain about. Overall a great experience and I would go back.,1
Disappointing for Hilton! Not as good as I expected from Hilton!,0
The room next to us was having some sort of party with yelling and music from 8pm-1am 3 nights in a row. I called the front desk the first two nights and they said they would send security up. I'm not sure if they did but it wasn't effective either way. Otherwise the hotel was great but this aspect was very frustrating.,1
We found a underwear inside the shower. During the pandemic| so they never clean properly that room.,0
Great experience fast check in and out| the bad pay so expensive for parking lot $30 per day.,1
Not a great location. Difficult to park and access hotel. Nice rooms and very comfortable.,1
Location but other then that nothing. Just a hotel that isn't properly cared for.,0
Everything was great. The front desk staff were courteous| the price for the room was outstanding| the accommodations were fine for a single traveler| the room was perfectly clean...I couldn't have asked for much else.,1
We were just visiting for a couple of days to get out of the house. Check in was fast and easy. We were offered a late check out with out asking. This was a nice touch and set a good mood for the rest of the stay. The hotel is in a great location next to Chinatown with lots of parking. The hotel is walking distance to Union Square| North Beach| Pier 39| and Fisherman's Wharf. Due to Covid| the pool and gym are closed and room cleaning is by request. Masks and social distancing are enforced. Some of the guest seem a little uptight about Covid. My suggestion would be if you are super worried about it| stay home. The staff are polite and professional and I'm glad they are here for us during this time. Things are limited in the city due to Covid. But it's a nice time to see the city without the crowds. Eating outside at North Beach was great. I definitely recommend the Hilton Financial District and a short stay in SF.,1
It was the most worst experience in my life toilet water wouldn't run smell like cigarettes,0
They need to remodel the hotel and add more elevators it's ridiculous having to wait 10 mins every time going down stairs| the lines for the elevator is honestly a drag no type of social distancing being enforced. I didn't see anyone cleaning surfaces that everyone touches. They all are lacking cleanliness inside the rooms and in the hotel lobby's.,0
Front desk are so terrible & rude. Hotel worst than expected.,0
Great location!  Close to the ferry building and fisherman's wharf.  Spacious rooms with nice views.  A bit shabby though and could use some updatind,1
Horrible room False advertisement I would never stay here again,0
The place was unique| the area not as interesting but nice place to stay.,1
Very helpful and thoughtful staff! Clean rooms and amazing views!!!,1
"I like the property was in the middle of downtown| very close to Chinatown. For a 4 star hotel I was charged a 4 star price for very little to meager accommodations. Example| no valet|no bellboy|no microwave in room| however there was a ""common "" one in the bar area| 1 microwave for guests in a 26 floor hotel|not very sanitary and a very long line to wait and use it. The bar and restaurant was closed. No fridge for my insulin. The morning of my check in Expedia sent me an email effectively upon my check in that SF has a shelter in place order| so I was able to check in early. Being on the 18th floor it was quite warm| as I had a bay view. First you can see half of the bay and the other half of SF community college across the street| poor view. As I began to unpack and freshen up| I noticed the towel rack mounted to the interior wall of the shower| which also seemed very unsanitary to me as well. I then turned the AC on and it barely blew any air. I notified maintenance and they stated the compressor went out and needed to be replaced. I then had to spend the afternoon in the lobby without enjoying any of the hotels features| art and amenities as most were closed and I would be violating the shelter in place order if I left the hotel| also due to the fires the quality of the air was unhealthy to be out in and with covid as well. Room 1801 was located right near 4 elevators and right next to a vending machine and ice machine|  which caused an unpleasant sleep.",0
Besides it being hot and the temperature control box not working and the bathroom tub semi clogged and the ice maker being out of service but overall was comfortable and got a discount on parking.,1
Great view. It was somewhat busy with the elevator but beside that everything was great,1
The hotel front desk staff were great but the security at front door were lazy & rude (late shift) The late shift needs to go to Public Relations Classes !! But other then that Hilton is a very nice place to stay,1
Convenient location| comfy beds| privacy. Front desk staff is very accommodating,1
There's always a long line using the elevator| they don't clean rooms everyday anymore| you got to ask front desk if you want towel or coffee refill. They will only clean your room after you check out| we stayed there 3 nights and have not cleaned our room. No microwave| no mini fridge in the room either and windows are dirty it's nice to see the city view if the windows are clean but looks like haven't cleaned for awhile.,0
Excelent service| overall a pleasant stay| room extra clean,1
This hotel should be embarrassed to call itself a Hilton. The front desk staff was so nice| however the hotel itself was not worth the Hilton name. The building was not the worst I've seen| but the room| and the halls to the rooms were disgusting! The carpets look like they were from a grandmother's house| the room smelled like smoke worse than anything I've ever experienced| and I understand it's COVID times| but I shouldn't have to go downstairs to get more towels. There's no reason someone couldn't drop towels off at the door.,0
This hotel needs to be updated the hallways look dirty with lots of stains on the carpet the room was not cleaned the bathroom mirror had old water stains on the mirror like it had not been cleaned. Overall I had a poor experience I will not be staying at this hotel again.,0
Very clean and awesome service!  Will forsure go back and stay there!,1
Great location| friendly staff| easy in and out for parking| Uber and airport shuttle. Hotel lobby was very clean. I would stay again| my only complaint would be that the hallway carpets could use a good cleaning and as in previous reviews: the room windows need to be cleaned! We had an amazing view of Coit Tower but the windows were extremely dirty.,1
The location of the Hilton Financial District was great.  It was close to the Ferry Building| Pier 39| Little Italy| Chinatown| Union Square| etc...My negative comments are that there was no small fridge in my room| there was no free bottled water or room cleaning services provided to my family and we stayed for 6 nights.,1
Elevators are outdated but considering the age of the building there isn't much to be done about that. Clean rooms and friendly staff.,1
I spent 200 for the night after parking fees it was like 190 actually. Dang virus because covid no bar or restaurant and I found a burger place open at 4:30 because I woke up so hungry.,1
The front desk/check in staff was extremely polite and helpful,1
Clean hotel with great staff and service located conveniently in the center of the city.,1
Great service! People friendly.. safe environment!,1
The staff was amazingly friendly and very accommodating.The room was a bit dated by the photos online.,1
It was close to shopping and eating. But you can hear everything the walls must be thin as paper,1
Not happy! Inside windows and room were filthy,0
Great Location!!!No fridge| microwave.Great view if the outside windows were not so filthy...,1
The staff are very friendly. We had a great view of the Coit Tower and the water but the windows are dirty. The sliding  door handle in the restroom is missing . The bed is not that comfortable.  The sheets are coean and pillows are good. The bath towels are excellent,1
They advertised bayside view upgrade knowing their windows are really dirty | i felt ripped off and staff just shrugged their shoulders,0
Good stay! Customer service was great! Front desk agents were all Friendly!,1
Requested a call from hotel staff regarding lost item| was never called back,1
Check in staff were great. Overly officious guards at entrance not good at all. They made it feel like entering a lockdown facility.,1
A good hotel in great location in San Francisco. Rooms are a little dated but it was a clean| comfortable hotel within walking distance to many great restaurants & bars in North Beach,1
Amazing staff members. Very accommodating. They even gave us a lake check out until 4 because our flight was not until 7. The parking was relatively cheaper $30 compared to the surrounding hotels. Our room was clean and comfortable. We just couldn't adjust the temperature. We called them and they said they would send someone to come and fix it; however the person couldnt make it on time and they offered us to change our room. Overall I recommend it.,1
I like Everything about it. The hotel was clean the ppl. were all kind nice and respectful and the view from the 16th. Floor was awesome. I recommend the Hilton to everyone who needs uh get away or just some place to go,1
It was a good relaxing getaway,1
Windos on high rise floors need washing| hard to get a good clear view or picture.,1
I really liked the air freshener dispenser in the room.,1
I had a great Birthday weekend here. The staff were super nice & helpful. Needed to put food in refrigerator & they sent one to my room right away. Room was clean & great area. Located in walking distance to China Town| North Beach & Trader Joe's & Fisherman's Wharf,1
Perfect stay and staff was amazing. They were courteous and professional all the time and very quick with my needs. The view was amazing from my room| especially at night.,1
The city view from the hotel room | and much more,1
Chose this hotel for its location near Chinatown in San Francisco and to North Beach restaurants.,1
Not impressed. It wasn't bad| but it was very expensive for a very basic room. Parking and WiFi were crazy expensive. I have had much better experiences in San Francisco at other hotels for less money.,0
The room was open and light.  The city view was excellent.  Clean room and comfortable bed.,1
Room not ready at check in and parking is ridiculous expensive,1
The hotel rooms are somewhat outdated| no fridge in the rooms. Check in/out was smooth and staff was really friendly. The lobby has a great welcoming decor. Overnight parking was pricey and parking was available across the street for half the price at Hilton. Location couldn't have been better. Having breakfast at the Hilton was a great idea| the food was good. We had an amazing waiter| Houari who was extremely kind| accommodating and ready to answer any of our questions. Customer service was great and we had a positive experience overall. It was worth it!,1
Great service.  Nice view.,1
This was a Valentine's Day weekend trip - just my girlfriend and I.  As one might imagine| our bed choice was king vs. two twin beds.  We deliberately selected the king room.  Upon arrival| we were given two twin beds.  I expressed that it was not acceptable but they claimed that there were no king rooms available and that it's not their fault as the reservations appear non-specific| faulting hotels.com.  Then| faulting us| they said| next time to book straight to the hotel to avoid this - taking zero accountability.   I later discovered that they were not sold out.  Disappointing.  And will not be returning.,1
i was put on the 19th floor right next to the elevators which i heard all night long until the morning. i was very up happy and very upset.,0
Workers were very rude and didn't even mention when I called that there in site parking was $65 a night so when I finally found parking I went to my room and brought all my stuff up by myself it was a very small room and the bay view I payed for was a view of a giant building next door. Not to mention there was no fridge| microwave| coffee| just water bottles for $3 a pop on top of the ac not working and no windows to open| not even a fan in the bathroom so your whole room gets steamed whee u shower. I would never recommend this place to sombody less u want a bad attitude from everyone that works there and there hand to open up asking for ‚Äúappreciation‚Äù .the room was dirty and Smells awful with only half the lights working.....,0
The hotel is In A great location. It's a little dated but rooms were very clean. Hotel staff was friendly. Front desk was wonderful. I would definitely stay here again.,1
Hallway was very dirty with clothes and plates next to door ways. Smelling like urine. Windows couldnt even enjoy the view since it was dirty!,0
Everything was good but for the over-night parking they charge $60 which is ridiculous.,1
There are 4 elevators servicing 27 floors; always a line to get on from lobby and longer wait on floors to get down. Can easily hear kids stomping and talking in hallways; including overhead/through walls - especially if they let the door slam shut. Side neighbor door slamming shook our wall with TV. It was not relaxing getting pulled into others 'excitement and running around a hotel' experience.,0
I like the location for sure. I didn't like prices over night stay should come with free breakfast,1
Since we have the Bay View rooms| the windows are too DIRTY for camera photos! Compare to our previous stays| the windows did not look that dirty!We wanted to have breakfast in the hotel but the waiting list was too long. Perhaps a better management could help to improve this service.,1
Bathroom door doesn't have a lock. Elevator doesn't work and had to wait for 30 mins or walk down the stairs.,0
We arrived early before check in hour and was given a room| staffs are friendly. Location is perfect if you crave for chinese foods etc because it is right across from China town.,1
Drinks very expensive. Room very nice and clean.,1
This is a great gem in a nice neighborhood.  We walked to a great Italian place| Palio.  Great service and welcoming from the owners.  Great food.   We got spot hero parking for $24 right around the corner so don't pay the $65 they want at the hotel.  Nice bar and gorgeous lobby.  Hallways are nice.  TV is big and easy to navigate.  Great black out or obscured window coverings or wide open to see the neighboring buildings.  Not a bad view.,1
Ivan at the reception was very welcoming and a delightful person. He made checking in a pleasure. Thank you!,1
Stay was amazing| just overnight parking is a little bit pricyShouldn't even be charged at all if we are guests,1
Great location and nice customer service.  Hotel room is comfortable but a little loud with outside noises.  Hotel room is not very up to date.,1
No fridge in the room. Parking was so expensive. The rest was okay,1
Live this hotel and it smells so good when you walk in.,1
they charged $3.00 for a bottle of water in the room| They tried to charge $65 for parking when you could get parking for $32 at the city garage across the street,0
in our booking it says.... fridge in room.... we had no fridge.... very outdated room..... not worth the money we spent,0
Great place to visit again I think they need more elevators Is a lit people 4 only 4 small elevators,1
No hot water in  shower Unable to get someone to answer phone for 45 minutes I checked out 5 hours after I checked in I don't recommend I am very disappointed,0
Love the view| location and price. Didn't like water pressure| safe not working and slow elevators,1
Very cold and wet in the city for my 2 day trip| my first nite was not a problem but the second day my room heater was not working properly. I let the front desk know about the problem around 8 pm| I told the young man that I would be leaving the hotel for about 3 hours. I was told   A technician will be available to look into the problem while I was gone .  However on my returned about 11:15 PM the situation was not resolved |  I called the front desk again and someone  was sent to my room around 11:40 PM .  The technician suggested that he needed to replace the unit| I could either stay in the room or move to another room|  I chose to move into another room since replacing the unit was going to take I thought up to two hours .  The technician on duty was pleasant and sincere but moving to another room at midnight is not something no one wants to do| especially if this matter could've been taken care of before I return to the room .   This matter should have been resolved before I left the hotel| it only took the technician 10 minutes to determine what needed to be done !  The room I transferred to was not as good as the original room. The  technician gave me a free breakfast coupon but I really feel this is very insufficient for the inconvenience I was spacey | plus this should have been a  priority earlier in the evening!  Upon checkout| I explain my dissatisfaction but because the room was paid for by a third-party already| she didn't care about my   Inconvenience ! üò†üôÅ,0
Our stay was very nice.  Hotel staff are friendly and helpful and the hotel itself is great!,1
Great service throughout,1
I got a double bed room my the elevator bank and got no sleep at all. It sounded like a deep rumble like a jet plane flying over the building every 20 seconds or so. Got the room for $100 a night but then $60 for parking and $10 for wifi? What a joke. Got no sleep and broadsided by hidden charges.,0
Attended world conference of TCM doctors from China new ways do combat cancer oncology,1
The hotel is ok| but nothing more. It is in need of a refresh. Also wait times for elevators can be long at times. Room was only done on one day of our three day stay. Seems there was some sort of communication error by housekeeping.  Just not a great experience.  Live and learn.,0
This Hilton was smack dab right between Financial District and Chinatown. The room we had was facing the city and we can even see the Koit tower. We loved that mostly everywhere we wanted to go was walking distance. The room and furniture was nicely furnished| you can tell it needs some work but nothing too drastic in my opinion since we were in and out of our room mostly. Concierge was very friendly and they would even check in on us time to time to make sure our stay is doing great. Its a great location| will most likely book another time with family.,1
The building looks old for the Hilton standard.Room furniture out of date also,1
Room and location were amazing. Only complaint was that there was no mini fridge in our room for leftover food. First hotel I've ever been to that was like this,1
Location is very strategic| staff are friendly| juice bar is a must,1
There was a child in the room next door and sounded like it was in the room.  Towels not very clean.  Disappointong for a Hilton.,0
Shower was at chest level. Dingy and old rooms along with hallway.  Expected it to overall be nicer for the rating and what I paid.,0
Me and my friends had a pleasant stay. The room had everything we needed and the view was excellent.,1
Very nice property. I've stayed here before. One complaint. Last time I parked valet was 50 . This last time it was 60 and I was charged 72 for some reason. They posted a sign for 18 dollars lol.,1
Beautiful room and a view of Coit tower. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful and the food service was great too. Only drawback was that it took forever to get an elevator. Long lines to get one in the lobby at times. Only 3 of the 4 were operational.,1
Clean roomsGreat location Very busy Pet friendly,1
- elevators took forever to come- no lights in half of the room- air conditioning unit falling apart - toilet didn't flush - could clearly hear the people in the room next door - no fridge,0
What you would expect.  Nothing amazing| but a decent Hilton.  All the extras are too expensive including parking| but that is a Hilton.,1
I would have loved to see Kids entertainment center/ pool .,1
Even though we are Hilton members| we had some real issues with hooking on to the WiFi| which was annoying.  Otherwise a pretty good stay.  Close to China town and a nice walk to pier 5.,1
Ivan the Great checked us in with enthusiasm and excellence.  The bellhop went above and beyond.  Great location steps from the heart of Chinatown.,1
They gave us a room with a barely functioning act| bathroom door that didn't slide all the way closed and was super hard to even open or close| the bathroom was very worn with rust and scratches everywhere| the tub looked questionable| and the pillows and sheets literally felt like plastic. One of the worst rooms I've had so far won't be staying here again even though the location is very good.,0
Property was fine. Clean and nice rooms. Problem was with the hotel staff.,0
Good hotel and convenient to most SF destinations. Parking rates are double that of the garage across the street| so that was not pleasant (I moved my car).,1
The room was pretty small| but really well maintained.  The staff was very friendly.  We ordered room service and it was delivered very promptly and was delicious.  The only complaint I have about my stay is that the windows were absolutely filthy.  They afforded a nice view of the financial district| but the dirty windows detracted from it.  I'm sure the inside of the windows were clean.....the outside definitely not.,1
We had a very comfortable and clean room with a nice view of the bay.,1
Overall our stay was nice| the hotel is located right in the middle of financial district and china town| close to major attractions and transportation accessible. Few thing I wished I would've known before booking our stay: WIFI not available if you book through a 3rd party. You have to be a member of Hilton honors and book through them| same goes for complimentary water bottles| if booked through a 3rd part they cost $3/16 oz| which is kind of funny having a big sign on each bottle. There were a number of conferences during our stay in the hotel| so the elevators were always packed| and it is more aimed to a business type of stay.,1
It was fine in most respects for my overnight stay| however| I booked a bayview room but the windiws wete so dirty you couldnt see out of them in room 2325. The bay may have been thete but we couldn't see it.,1
Room was terrible IT IS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURES,0
It was a good stay| the bell service was very polite .,1
The elevator service was ridiculously bad. 10 to15 minute wait every time you wanted to take the elevator.,1
I made the reservation online and there was nothing stating that I had to pay $50 for parking and $50 deposit. I was charged for parking however I don't have a car. Management has yet to resolve this issue.,0
Pro: great location| room is quiet| good A/C| and price is fair.Con: the shower head has really low flow| and the window is dirty.,1
Very nice accommodations and staff was friendly. Only downside was the parking rate of $55 for 1 night.  I realize that most city hotels charge a parking fee but just thought this amount was high.,1
I booked a room that was listed at a 600plus room| but i got a double bed and a small room.  Hardly up to expectations.  I am a gold member and entitled to a continental breakfast| but the restaurant did not have a record despite the fact that I had the front desk look up and enter the number.,0
We chose the Hilton for its name and supposed reputation however this experience has sealed the deal on never staying in a Hilton again. $200 per night would have been better spent at an independent hotel.,0
Location wise| it was great. However the property was run down and needed some serious cleaning. Plus| my neighbour might as well have been in my room. Could hear the full conversation. Would not stay there again,0
Room with King size bed is spacious and has a fabulous view of the Marina and Coit tower.  Hotel is quiet and situated steps from the heart of China town and close to North Beach and the Financial district.,1
Room was somewhat dirty when we arrived. Empty water bottles in room and bed had dirt spots,1
Great location overall good place to stay. They had valet witch was a plus,1
Excellent customer service!  Sharon from the bar/restaurant| remembers your name after the first visit.,1
Pros: hard to beat the location and the staff is really good. but hats off to the restaurant - the room service is unbelievable. Food is actually hot and very good when it arrives to room.  Worth the extra fees!  Cons: parking is really expensive,1
Nice hotel and bar glad we only stayed 2 nights| SF full of homeless and the mentally ill| thousands| you cant avoid them| expect interaction.Monterey|Redwoods|wine country 1000% better than sf.,1
Truly outstanding staff. From maids in the hallways to the bell staff. EVERYONE is helpful and friendly. I stay at Hilton's all over and this location is absolutely the best.,1
Location was convenient to the attractions - restaurant and pier 39,1
The environment is very warm and inviting. Our representative at the front desk was very welcoming and informative.,1
Service was terrible| they treat me like a third class citizen,0
Walls too thin & could hear noise which is not ideal,1
The location was quite good for business purposes and for shopping and sight seeing.,1
Love the blackout curtains. I got a great night of sleep. Its close to all the best restaurants including Original Joe's and Tony's Pizza.,1
The valet staff wasn't rude but pretty close to it. Neither of the guys that helped me had a good attitude. I attempted to put my bags in my car and they gave me the keys and told me to go look for it instead of pulling the car up for me. That's the first time I have ever had a valet do that. Also the car wasn't in the assigned spot so I had to search for it.Overall the hotel was amazing and beautiful. Prime location!,1
It was very clean| the staff were very kind and easy to approach. The location is perfect| you can easily walk anywhere because it is close to a lot of good places and food joints/ restaurants.,1
Overpriced| ridiculous parking fee $60. Not a nice area,0
The service and property are worse than expected| and the rooms are old,1
Executive level is the best| you get your own 24 hour lounge with snacks!,1
I just wasn't happy at all. My whole day is ruined,0
Loved the location we were able to walk everywhere. The room service was surprisingly fantastic! The staff was extremely helpful.,1
It was in the business district which was close to a lot of restaurants but was a long walk to the main attractions at the waterfront,1
Very very bad customer service| promised to pickup at airport but never showed up and then denied that they had agreed to pickup. Reception people not polite or friendly at all. They don't deserve to be in Hotel business as hospitality doesn't exist in their dictionary!!,0
The room was really clean and nice| but the area wasn't the greatest. Still close to a lot of things. I had meetings later at night| so by the time I got back to the area| there wasn't much open for food and room service was also done for the night. Otherwise| it was a clean hotel in the middle of Chinatown and I was able to sleep well and shower| so it did all that I needed.,1
Staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful. We called in an issue with there being no hot water in our shower right before stepping out to dinner. They called us back and gave us a room upgrade as their remedy to the issue. Even the bartenders were friendly when we visited the bar for happy hour. Rooms  are not generously large but neither are they tight by SF standards. Great location adjacent to Chinatown and North Beach area. About 10-15 minute walk to the Montgomery BART/Metro station.,1
right by  chinatown| easy access to a great many chinese cuisine,1
The location is great. With lots of dining choices being next to Chinatown and Italian dining areas. Walkable to fisherman wharf. However the room is a little old. Need a much needed refurbishment.,1
It was good/ better than expected Nice and close to china town with a comfy bed .. bit old and tired .. but that wasn't key,1
Get to the hotel sort of late and check in. Finally figure out how to get the automatic blinds down (took a while; it wasn't apparent how to do it. Again| it was late and I was tired). Wake up early because the maintenance team thought it would be a good idea to start using a drill RIGHT NEXT DOOR before 7AM. Then they were working on the tile outside the room which was making even more noise. The bathroom looked dirty; the wallpaper was stained with splashes of I don't even want to know what it was. Upon check out| the front desk person asked me about my stay and I told her about al of the noise| she didn't offer an apology| just checked me out and that was that. There is also another $50 charge to my credit card for no reason| on top of the room charge and the valet for my car. I couldn't get out of there fast enough. I have stayed at Hilton's before (including this one) and have never had this level of disappointment.,0
For us| Hilton has a certain name and reputation. For the cost paid it was well below expectation. I could hear a baby crying in a room a few doors down| the hot water and shower pressure were underwhelming. And up on the 7th floor I did not expect to be able to hear the traffic as clear as I did. Was an old building| but really needs an upgrade or loose the Hilton name,0
Everyone was friendly and helpful.,1
Good Service and good rooms.Would have preffered to stay here always| but pricing is steep.,1
The bellman was very helpful and friendly. The front desk personnel were efficient |outgoing and knowlegable of the area.  The consiere took the time to explain our siteseeing options well. The best individual who went out of his way to be helpful was the bellman,1
Very good position| close to everything you want to see in San Francisco.,1
Is in a good location| but parking was super overpriced.,1
The location is great. Easy to walk to China town and Union Square.,1
We ordered room service and the food was wonderful too.,1
I liked the location.  Hotel rooms were clean| but small.  Customer service & experience was terrible.,0
I really enjoyed everything about the room. Simple| clean| and great area,1
Great location. Nice rooms. $4.10 for a 20oz coke is hiway robbery. Elevators can be overwhelmed at times.,1
The area was in a convenient location. There was no microwave and charged $3 for a water bottle.,1
I had to wait in a long line to check in. The lobby was dingy and unimpressive when I first came in. For the money the room was worn,0
We arrived early and couldn't get into our room so they said they would call us when it was ready which was way after 3:00 check in time. Then my husband was not allowed to go to the room without us contacting Expedia to add his name. They would not let me add his name without going to Expedia.,0
Great lobby and restaurant. Room has a nice TV. The bed is comfy.,1
Like the Asian theme and staff was amazing!Didn't like bathroom door and shower curtain didn't fit rod. There were a couple minor things that ended up being compensated a lil for .....They turned off key had go get new onesThey didn't tell us we could do downstairs buffet until 3 rd day.( did 26th floor) No maid service after second nightAnd 27 th floor ran out of ice in the machine.The fend shui of the bar by the elevators didn't feel right .... wishing for a more social bar atmosphere Thank you- loved the view! But Hated paying $80 a night to be able to smoke. And $55 a day for parking as guest. Otherwise great AC and bedsWished you had pay per view- they said no longer available .,1
Love the restaurant and breakfast!Great location!,1
we were there for work| but also took in a ball game while we were there.  The hotel was beautiful and clean and comfortable.  The beds were amazing| I did not want to get out.  I was really impressed with the prices of the room considering it was a Hilton| and in the City.  I would most diffently stay there again and recommend it to my friends.,1
Location near ChinatownWe The rooms are very clean the house staff was very personable and helpful  restaurant and bar very nice a good selection for breakfast,1
hotel smelled bad| service was grumpy| looked old and dated,0
The Concierge was very helpful in booking two tours and a few restaurant recommendations| even calling ahead to make a reservation.,1
Excellent location!!! Columbus Street| MOMA| Chinatown everything within walking distance.,1
At the heart of Chinatown. Lots of Chinese restaurants around. Good service.,1
Great location| clean| and the staff was amazingI highly recommend this location.,1
Easy access to parking garage either at the hotel or across the street. Parking attendants shared parking garage tips for more cost effective parking. Clean and easy walking distance to Little Italy and North Beach.,1
The location is perfect for walking thru parts of China town and over to Little Italy| and then to the Pier and more.   I love Evelyn at the front desk.  She was warm| welcoming and found us a great room to celebrate my kids acceptance to college.,1
Love this hotel. Always easy check in & out. Great location & the bay side view rooms are SF gold!,1
The Hilton is very worn.  Room was updated maybe 15 years ago| hallways were original.  I would never have book a Hilton property if this was the condition.  It was sort of clean.  However tub was rusted and carpet very worn.  There are better hotels in the area.  Sorry Hilton I be in in Hamptons Inns that were significantly nicer.,0
Great location| in the heart of the financial district.,1
The property was ok and location was great for union square and china town as well as access to the bridge. Staff were excellent I couldn't fault them it's just a shame the carpets were a bit worn in places in the hallway and in the room a couple of threadbare patches. I would stay here again.,1
Everything here was amazingly comfortable and clean. A granite desk area overlooks the city. TV was at least 65 inches. The only thing to note was that the room did not have a refrigerator| but everything else was so great I can't really complain.,1
Amazing experience at the Hilton hotel. I'll definitely be back again.,1
Parking is expensive! Over 60 dollars a night! The hotel was super nice though!,1
I have stayed in many hiltons| but this was by far the worst| The room was very underwhelming. The batroom was old. The property seemed to belong to the stone age.,0
The housekeeping staff was very noisy talking in the halls waking me up,1
Most comfortable beds ever! Stayed 3 nights for business and slept like a rock. Highly recommend.,1
Only on Hotels.com can you and your family stay at a luxury hotel for 3 star prices!  I stay at this hotel consistently because of the comfort| location and price.  Walking distance to downtown| North Beach| Union Square| parks...just an incredible location! Hotel has lobby bars| tremendous views and very clean.  This is a $700+ hotel that I have been able to get for under $200!!  No reason to stay anyplace else...I almost didn't write the review because I wanted to keep it a secret!!!,1
Lovely Chinese New Year,1
Excellent central location| reasonable rates| nice amenities| easy check-in/out| everything you would expect from Hilton. Great restaurants and tea shops just around the corner. The many WiFi options were a bit confusing and the access code on the hotel key did not work exactly as the instructions indicated| but the complimentary internet was perfectly fine so the complicated premium options were not necessary. Would stay again!,1
I did not like the elevators they needs to have maintenance done on them,1
Check-In was Easy| and was allowed to check-in early since we arrived Early.,1
Very responsive staff; very polite and helpful.  The free valet service was hreat.,1
our trip to san fran was amazing! the hotel was in a good part of the city and we were able to walk all over the city and back. the only negative were the pillows.,1
Hotel management and corporate were an absolute waste of time. Made us move rooms without notifying us prior| on top of that| it was difficult to speak of anyone if management or authority level on site. HORRIBLE,0
Executive floors bayside offer fabulouse panoramic views which I highly recommend. The Executive Lounge is a nice added touch that comes with Executive Floor rooms and includes breakfast and hor d'oeuvres and beer & wine on the evening. The beds are fabulously comfortable (at home I use a NovaFoam mattress topper). Property is older| but well located in the financial district. Rooms are well maintained and while visually they indicate they are likely due for an updating renovation in the not too distant future they are still very appealing.,1
Location: dirty| filthy  neighborhood close to China town| probably in China town.old| filthy carpets.Thin walls| could hear people in neighboring rooms talkAdvise: If you don't need to be in Financial district| would not not stay here,0
We were on the 14th floor on a Friday night| and could hear everything happening outside our room. Some folks were having a party that extended from their room and into the corridor and others had loud phone calls being made. Some time in the wee hours of the night a car alarm went off somewhere in the neighborhood and it felt as if we were right on top of the car. Also| the pillows were meh. During my 3 night stay| I found out that I could keep the fan for the heating unit permanently ON to keep the noise under control. Spoke to other people in the hotel who said they had a quiet experience in upper floors - we were on the 14th floor. The view of the bay from our Bay View room was partial| mostly facing the building across but still decent. But the hotel itself| is in a great location and is easy to get to everywhere else in SF. I hardly noticed other people with children and did not find this to be a place catering to families. Will not return.,0
The view we had was really nice. I really appreciated the entrance. It was elegant and looked clean. Elevator could use some work but other than that I really liked the hotel and would stay there again for sure.,1
Great location. Cleanliness of rooms and good restaurants within the hotel.,1
Location| cleanliness| and staff. I like how the hotel is located close to certain things,1
Amazingly well kept hotel. I hadn't stayed here in 10 years| but found the high quality original design holds up well to modern standards. Much larger room than I'm used to getting in San Francisco| and wonderful views from both sides. Room service burger was perfectly cooked and arrived in 15 minutes| piping hot! Only challenge was no Hilton points gained| but they did honor my status| so I got free Wi-Fi| bottled water and breakfast.,1
Construction on the floor and noisy,0
A first class experience all around. Great location| very friendly & useful staff as well as good amenities.,1
Great location| very courteous staff. The views were spectacular. It's not cheap| but better overall experience than most.,1
The room was in poor condition| specifically the bathroom/shower area. Unfortunately| we were not awareof the problem until (10:30 PM) several hours after we checked-into our room|  when we took o,0
- Check in was easy and smooth| though the check-in person wasn't informative or very friendly. Just checked me in. - The printers hooked up to the guest computers in the lobby did not print| and I tried several times during my stay. They probably needed to be rebooted| but at least the front desk person told me to forward my attachment to her and she printed it.,1
great service; friendly staff. really slow and impacted elevators.,1
Cleaning lady was very friendly and helpful. Very clean in hotel,1
Not organized. Dirty. And discrimination from stuff,0
Good location. Convenient Financial Dist. location close to many offices.,1
Surprisingly thin walls (floor) for such an upscale hotel. Even moderately elevated voices/noises were distractingly loud or disruptive (eg| to sleeping). Otherwise| just what was advertised and what I'd expect from Hilton.,1
We enjoyed our stay. Beds were comfortable. Staff were friendly. Although I wasn't happy on a bottle of wine I had bought there. There was a certain of wine I was wanting and the bar didn't carry it. So staff suggested another. Saying it was similar. So we brought it to our room to enjoy. It was the most awful tasting wine ever! It wasn't even close to the one we had wanted. So that was a disappointment. The bottle went to waste and our money. Staffs needs to know their wine better!!,1
Very good location. Very nice hotel people. So glad to stay in this hotel for my trip to San Francisco. Will choose again next time.,1
Nice hotel in a great area of town.,1
Will definitely stay here again if in the area room was excellent views are excellent all around good hotel,1
"The only thing that was just ""okay"" were the elevators. They were quite slow and sometimes had to wait five minutes for one to arrive (four elevators to cover 27 floors).",1
The service at the front desk was good| but the room was below par. The cleaning of the bathroom left much to be desired.,0
Definitely an older property| but good location and helpful staff. My lovely view was difficult to enjoy between the heavy / stubborn blinds and the clouded windows. Room was clean and relatively quiet.,1
Staff was great! The room was clean with amazing views of the city. The hotel site was very clean with a beer and wine bar with good food.,1
Guest service is awesome no hassle check in. Room was clean and housekeepung kept our room in good standing throughout out our visit.Only down side is parking !!! So pricey and sketchy ! But i guess thats how it was all around the area . Other than tgag great hotel !,1
Nice view and nice loacation!There is an delicious wonton soup restaurant near by hotel!,1
Great property with an amazing staff. Take note giant chain hotels of SF. This place sets the standard.,1
Good location at good price . Reception never answes the phone though,1
I appreciated most the morning staff for Breakfast. I was what I can describe was a business education trip. I was in a hurry and they staff there really respected my needs. In fact one of the staff remembered me from the day before| though I did not remember him. They were great. I wish I could have enjoyed the hotel more. The garage was okey| had to really maneuver around though. Glad my Girl Friend did the driving here| and of course San Francisco streets can be somewhat difficult. I used to driver here a lot| but it has been quite a while. The staff here was first rate.,1
Reception was hard to find| no one answered phone  .  Had to try many times  to talk to some one at reception  . Wifi was not very good. Hotel was clean| good location.,1
Good place to stay convenient location mny things to do around,1
The heater was not working the first night when the outside temp was in the 40s. My wife and I had to put all cloths when we went to bed.Called and stopped by the front desk at least 4 times the next day but nobody cares until I demanded to talk to the general manager at 8:00pm the next day. They replaced the heater at around 9:00pm the second night.,0
We had a wonderful time in San Francisco the town is amazing. The hotel is nice enough| not as nice as I expected but it was clean and the rooms were nice but a bit cramped.  The staff was lovely| especially the concierge desk and Ken Muse who went above and beyond to help reunite me with my lost bag during the holiday.,1
Had a great stay for our anniversary. Service ok| the hotel could use some updating. Hallway carpet is nasty. Valet is way to high. It's outrageous! We did appreciate the effort of staff to be accommodating.,1
No continental breakfast or coffee or hot tea park car way too much should be 25 a day not 50,1
Very good location!  Could walk easily to Fisherman's Wharf and Union Square. Chinese restaurants everywhere| and Italian restaurants just a couple of blocks away.,1
Very nice hotel! So close to union square and Chinatown/North Beach,1
Great location. Service is also excellent. When we arrived| tom wasn't ready| so we were treated for complementary breakfast which was excellent.,1
Beautiful view from our room. Lovely amenities and great staff.,1
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Hilton SF financial District. View from top floor rooms are amazing. The gentleman at the front desk assigned a room on 21st floor without any hesitation upon request. Most of the attractions are at walking distance from this hotel. Use the public parking right opposite to the hotel to save some money!,1
Liked the apliances in the room. Didn't like the fact that breakfast wasn't included,1
It is nearby almost all attraction| so it's a good location. Parking will be costlier since you will have to pay 60$ per day if you have your own car.,1
It was a nice place to stay. The only thing I could think of were that the walls were paper thin so you could hear everything around you and others could hear you too. They were very quick when we asked for more pillows and blankets and the room was very clean and in a good location.,1
Quite a few turnoffs... valet/overnight parking didn't work at 10:05pm and had to self park then exit the next morning. Breakfast was bad| from un-toasted bread on an Eggs Benedict to unripe fruit served. Complained to the front desk clerk who said she'd credit both items| then ended up charging $150. And they even charge business travelers a petty charge for wifi! Really petty.,0
So bad| and they charge for parking | dirty room | bad service,0
Great customer service. Good amount of equipment in the fitness center.,1
Location near the financial district was perfect for work,1
We were very happy with our stay at the Hilton.  Had a great room.,1
The room was dirty| especially in the bathroom. Heavy dirt in the shower and what appeared to be mold spots on the ceiling. Location also not great.,0
Walls are too thin| can hear the couple next door having intercourse. Pillows were way too soft and I had trouble sleeping.,0
The hotel was good for a quick weekend getaway with a good cafe.,1
Good location| halls have a funny smell. Last day it was a evacuation drill for employees but unclear for guest,1
Great hotel.  Excellent service and convenient.,1
Friendly and helpful staff. Always service with a smile.,1
Everything was great. The hotel employees were very friendly and helpful| the room was very comfortable and the location is also convenient. My only complain is on the carpet; it is old and smelly| especially throughout the hallways.,1
It was a comfortable and quiet place. The staff was very accommodating and helpful. I will book here again,1
Great location| very clean room| although small. We were not a big fan of a barn door for the bathroom| no privacy. Bed was not comfortable at all. Me and the wife did not sleep well.,1
The lounge was small and the breakfast modest but the bed was very comfortable.,1
Lovely view from some rooms. Great location near Ferry Building| Jackson Square| etc. Professional| functional hotel.,1
Good location for my needs. Reasonable cost.,1
Great location near financial district| China Town and north beach.  Great staff at front desk. And at wine bar| shout out to Paul.,1
Very comfortable and so convenient to the North Bay.  The upgrade to Executive was perfect because it included breakfast which was delicious! It was a very quiet stay.,1
The room was clean| typical sized room. The location was near the Pier which is nice. I end paying twice for parking; the regular parking was not upgraded to valet. They charged me separately even though| I asked. The hospitality personnel were either distracted or halfheartedly working there. They could improve on their hospitality skills and friendliness. The only reason I went was to spend time with friends. The price for a night was not worthit| but that's San Francisco for you...pay pay pay,1
I did not like the parking situation having to pay $60 for parking after paying over $300 for the hotel the parking should be included with the bill,0
The location is great!  It was convenient to tour around San Francisco.  The room was spacious| and different fluffiness of the pillows were awesome!,1
I got a disability bathroom despite making the reservation a month ahead of time. They would not change the room claiming the hotel was full,0
Although I expected the Hotel to be closer to the Financial District and I would more accurately call this location Chinatown| it was newly renovated and the entire neighborhood was re-energized. The staff were super helpful and not at all invasive - perfect balance of helpful and friendly but well enough designed that help was not needed that often.,1
as an Hilton in downtown SanFrancisco| was dirty (hair in the bed)| ‚Äúupgrading‚Äù me to the worse room available!!!| as 2 single bed (120cm...even Hilton SFO list it as 2  king size bed/full bed!!!)| any morning call! Some hostel are much better| fun & enjoyable clean | with nice decoration! From the windows| impossible to sea outside (Hilton keep clean only some sharing area| like windows on the corridor| or some part of the lobby)! Noisy all night| by neighbours on the side| corridor or walking loodly like elephants/wood construction)! It looks more a ancient/old 2 stars hotel than a high standard business hotel to get rest from a li g flight (Hong-Kong via Europe +20h)! I was wrong to choice this Hilton| when Hyatt Hotel in SFO Airport was much much better (not new| but keeping well its standard)! Hilton SFO doesnt care about its clients| 50% chinese due the Chinatown| usually one of the community whom did not complains about dirty issues! A lasy Hilton hotel!,0
Awesome location and easy to book at the last minute.,1
Great experience very satisfied! Everything is walking distance.,1
Great Location and very professional staff.,1
The lobby was nicely decorated and the staff was excellent and helpful.  They are under construction so that created a bit of havoc and one morning the lobby men's room was out of order.  Would have loved to see more effort to put recycling waste baskets in rooms.,1
Nice accommodations. Great for business travel.,1
The rooms were clean and comfortable!,1
Only real gripe was as in most reviews we would of had a great view of the bay only for the windows to be really dirty that it totally ruined it.,1
It was very uncomfortable and noisy| the walls were so thin that I heard the people next to my room snoring| people talking in the hallway| talking on the upper floor| every single noise. In the morning there was a layer of white fluff on top of everything| I guess it was coming from the AC. As a Hilton Owner I will never go back to that Hilton hotel anymore| they don't care about quality no more.,0
Very old,0
It was a old hotel needs some upgrade.There was no refrigerator in our room even though Hotels.com shows that there is a refrigerator in the room!! So I asked the reception about that. The guy says that none of their room has refrigerator and  it is the third party's mistake to describe that there is a refrigerator in the room.I travel a lot but never saw the room without a refrigerator.,0
We had an excecutive suit witch meant a really astonishing bay view and a really good breakfast was included,1
Centrally located in walking distance to Union Square| Fishermans Wharf| etc. Good beds and friendly staff; Quick check-in and -out. Parking is overpriced; Avoid to buy breakfast at the hotel| it is way way overpriced and food-quality nothing special.,1
The room was so neat and clean| and I liked the part of where I can have bar table set right in front of the big window and had a cup of wine looking this beautiful scenery outside with a little ocean view with my girlfriend was absolutely amazing. Bathroom is awesome too| it just looks beautiful and clean. There is some decent blinder for the window with the control button and it perfectly covers sunlight when it is too bright| and it will help you with your comfortable staying and cozyness. The night was one of most amazing & beautiful night in Hilton Financial District!,1
The hotel location is quite good. The room was clean and the front desk was also nice,1
I like the location of the hotel right by the bay.,1
Upon arrival| the 2nd shift desk clerk was a jerk!He didn't offer any bottled water. Didn't tell us that we had to request housekeeping. Didn't tell us anything! Only as we were leaving| we heard the desk clerk| (a different one)| explaining everything and had to ask her to repeat it for us.,1
The hotel was nice and all but parking was ridiculous. There was no parking after 9pm. I had to go to the front desk to ask where can I park cause there's nothing open. Front desk told me another area I can park. Besides that..the hotel was perfect for our stay! It was quiet too!,1
Room was great! Loved the view of our room! Will definitely be coming back here. If you're looking to stay here make sure to book a bay view room. My wife & kids loved this hotel thanks again!,1
Location right at the edge of bay WITH trails along the bay front.,1
Excellent hotel in middle of busy SF. Great views. Nice trail to walk around and get your mind off of stress. Good food. Most of the people are mindful about cleanliness and masks and social distancing| little older furniture and glitchy TV but doesn't matter in big picture.,1
Amazing experience other than due to Covid the pool being closed,1
Waterfront location like. Cafeteria style frozen food for breakfast. It use to be made to order. Noise from a/c unit and staff in early morning we were on 2nd floor facing street. Having to go get your own restock on coffee packets and not have housekeeping bring you. Parking watch out for another$36 anight. Wifi not free until you sign up for free membership rewards. Pool not available. What a downer. Use to love staying at embassy suites. Might as well have stayed at motel6 at least we knew what we'd be in for. Pandemic or no pandemic,0
Pretty hotel. great view. Only draw back is Covid restrictions- no pool and stingy on providing extra towels.,1
Next to the bay was unique. Shuttle service driver was very knowledgeable about the area.,1
It was a good stay| didn't spend much time in the room| but when we need towels or other items  the housekeeping staff was very friendly and very helpful. We have stayed at this Embassy Suites about 5 times and we like the location.,1
I liked the breakfast that Embassy suites provides. What I did not like or what I did not notice is that when I arrived I was told that I would have to pay for parking and parking at the embassy suites in  milpitas  Didn't have a fee for parking. What I also thought was disturbing is that when I arrived at at 2:30 in the afternoon a room was not available or I should say the room they had placed me and was not available and it wasn't until another attendant said to put him in a different room that they finally did.. After driving in from Fresno my friend and I were tired and all we wanted to do was get into a room and relax.. But delayed in getting a room was not favorable.,1
Over all the hotel was good| rooms were ok| and breakfast was good. I just didnt like that we had to pay for parking| and we had to park super far too.,1
The breakfast was exactly the same menu every day not variety!! Some of the front desk personal wasn't willing to help. The pool was closed and that was the main reason why I choose this hotel| my kids were very disappointed!!,1
Our stay was ok | sadly inside evening dining was closed the night we stayed. Not a lot of eating choices close by. We did go to a neighboring Hotel that had a dining  and Bar open.,1
The hotel is great and the staff al of them great| Thank you to all üòÉ,1
Nice property| close to the waterfront. Spacious rooms - clean. Pool is unfortunately closed (until further notice) for not meeting city requirements. Breakfast options are limited| so is the restaurant (menu and opening hours). The limited staff they have is making an effort to accommodate guests as good as they can.,1
The Embassy Suites is always at the top of my list of places to stay.,1
Didn't like on how dirty our room was| plus found two bugs on bed. Manager wouldn't give me my refund only moved my family and I to a different room. Would not recommend this hotel to anyone,0
The stay was just fine. What I'm upset about is the fact that it was not disclosed that the pool was closed and the reason I booked this hotel was because of the indoor pool| my kids were looking forward to the stay to enjoy and swim in the pool. Please do a better job disclosing which amenities are not available!,0
My stay overall was pleasant. I did have a bad aftertaste when I noticed a $72 charge in my c.c statement.  Come to find out it was for parking. It was not mentioned to me at the front desk. I don't remember seeing it in Hotels.com. Maybe it was in the fine print somewhere... so beware.,1
Location is great| parking is quite hefty,1
Will  not go back,0
We loved the Koi pond in the center lf the hotel and the foliage. The view from the rooms were amazing. The receptionist and the security gaurd were amazingly courteous.,1
I like because Close to Airport And I didn't like is there is no service| crappie brake fast and no house cleaning person| nothing working on the place | ask for cleaning room service | refrigerator was not working| air conditioning was not working. Never come back,0
Over priced for bad customer service,0
We have a newborn and need a refrigerator to keep milk and other items he needs cold. When me and my wife got to the room the refrigerator was not working at all. I told the receptionist the problem and they had it fixed in less than 15 minutes. Amazing service and stay.,1
When we first checked in room 523 smelled of urine| we weren't offered any assistance to move room up 3 floors with a toddler and four other children in tow. We weren't even given enough water for our room. Our room was for six and we were only given 2 bottles of water. There were no extra pillows or blankets for the sofa bed. Breakfast  was horrible but the service from the cafeteria woman was the best service we got from anyone there at the embassy's waterfront property.The location is so beautiful but it didn't distract me from the callous and rude behavior of the front desk staff the manager did not offer any solutions for this horrible treatment of rectify it withThe staff. One of the staff members even called one of her fellow peers ‚Äòstupid' for giving me the wrong information. I can't say I'll ever come again to stay. The waterfront doesn't need this eyesore named the embassy.,0
The hotel shows all amenities but has 0 amenities open. Very disappointed for the price I paid,0
Felt very safe (covid) on the property. Only one older gentleman was seen without a mask and clueless of social distancing in the food line. Maybe having masks available in an area that is congested would help. Otherwise all staff was friendly and helpful. Rooms were comfortable and the view of the bay was amazing. Would definitely stay there again.,1
Nice setting and location| lovely atrium. Extra sitting area was useful. Balcony was NOT worth the upgrade| too small to even step out onto. Ocean view was nice but not great at low tide which was Extremely Low. Nice view of airport landings. Breakfast was decent| long lines. Only complaint was no hotel van service from airport operating currently due to Covid. Uber was almost $50 for 2 miles!,1
the hotel was clean. But some needs to upgrade. The tub was peeling off. Didn't offer a cleaning service every day.,1
when i booked this hotel| they had a shuttle service to and from the airport. when we landed late at night| we found that there was NO shuttle| so we had to find a taxi. There was no option for food when we got to the hotel. The next morning we were looking for a good breakfast| but found that there was a line forty to fifty people in line. If i knew about the amenities that they stopped| i would have book somewhere else. I will not stay at this hotel again.,0
Upon check in| the place looked deserted. No one was at the front desk. After a few minutes a man came to assist us.  We told him we were celebrating our 30th Anniversary. We were suppose to stay two nights. He ask if we had a vehicle| we said yes. They charged 36. Extra a night to park your car. We went to the room the furniture was outdated dark and very uncomfortable. The T.V's was from the 90's. I looked out the window for the bay view and it was none. I called the front desk and ask if they could give us a bay view. He said that would be 40. Extra a night. We asked about the WiFi that was 10. Extra a night. We ask about the breakfast and reception hour. They said no reception hour. Breakfast is a box breakfast. This Embassy Suites needs to be down graded. It does not meet Embassy Suites standards. Plus their were raccoons running in the parking lot.,0
AC did not work| the room only had 4 small pillows| it was a sleeper for 6.,0
Air conditioning didn't work for the first two days and we asked to have the room cleaned to have the garbage taken out because we have a newborn  and it wasn't done,0
Very beautiful area| clean quiet. Beautiful views of the water. Hotel was very nice| staff was friendly.,1
Sofa smelled like mold and wet dog.  Front desk staff rude and unhelpful.  $36 for parking in a lot with no security or cover.,0
Beautiful hotel. Close to the airport and transport. The bay is a few steps out the front entrance. We stayed during covid| so we weren't able to enjoy the restaurant in the building| but it looked awesome. The court in this hotel is gorgeous. Very fair priced.,1
There was a party at Room 318 on May 7th. It was horrible as I called reception starting 12:10am the another one at 1am since it didn't stop. Staff poorly intervened during the first call. I didn't get a good sleep. TVs are already old. USB charger doesn't work. Hotel needs upgrade.,0
The parking fee was too high| next time I am going to look for a free parking instead a free breakfast| it is cheaper!,1
Parking charge was unacceptable.Felt that we were sucker punched.Hidden charges are never received well.Need to be like Costco.Fair honest upfront with quality products at a fair price.,1
Stay away from this hotel. Our stay was so bad. Their was no a/c and they gave us fan instead. We have to pay $36 for parking but parking is always full on site and they let us park on the street. I was disappointed with orbitz| i tried calling to make a complaint but no one is available to answer. I know we have a pandemic but i dont think what we experienced was right. Personally i feel we deserved a refund or atleast a discount. I'll be more careful booking with orbitz while we have a pandemic. I dont think they have enough human resources to help you out. I used to book all my vacation through them but not right now.,0
The staff was awful. Rude. Three days there and I had to cut my trip two nights short. Awful.,0
Didn't expect the condition of the rooms to be so disappointing.,0
I enjoyed my stay at Embassy Suites. I would've liked for the airport shuttle and the exercise facility to have been available. I'm happy that a hot| cooked breakfast was available daily.,1
Would not recommend this hotel.,0
We were there for less than an hour after check-in. An inch and a half cockroach pretty much was the determining factor for us to leave at 1:00 am. The blasting party in the room next to us was also a factor but we would have stayed had it not been for the roach. It was disgusting.,0
The property ground was nice and clean. Staff was nice. The free breakfast was not good at all. The pool was closed due to a swim class the whole weekend. The bed and pillows were uncomfortable and had no extra pillow or blankets located in the room.,0
Room small and window dirty| beds also small with mini pillows and two bath towels| very disappointed in something called Embassy suites! Not.,0
It was easy check in . Nice location and friendly staff,1
Love the bay view on the room but the breakfast was limited and parking really expensive and with trash everywhere,1
I have stayed at this hotel many times and I have always been received with great customer service except for this trip. Lucy at the front desk has horrible communication skills. The hotel should think twice before having this person at the front desk. She is rude!! Don't think you want this as your first impression. The hotel was dirty. Never saw anyone vacuuming in hallways| which were very dirty. The wonderful breakfast spread that the hotel usually has| was much to be desired.  The quality that I am normally used to receiving from Embassy Suites was sadly missing. Maybe it's time to look for another hotel.,0
"Worst hotel stay ever! They advertise as ""COVID compliant""  when we checked into our ""sanitized"" room I found pubic hair in the tub. Reported it to the front desk and I was told they did not have housekeeping on site and the only thing they could do is change my room. I changed rooms and the AC in the room was not working| we had to open the balcony door to keep the room fresh.  There is a sign in the room that states Housekeeping will only be done upon request. I called front desk at 9am and was told my request had to be in before 8:30am.  The next day I called at 7am and was told housekeeping would come by and only take out trash and take dirty towels. When I came back at 5pm it was not done. When I called front desk I was placed on hold for 20 minutes then they hung up on me. I called back and was told that because of ""COVID"" they do not do housekeeping during the stay.  I had to take my out trash out and the hey questioned me on the amount of towels I requested from the front desk.   Definitely do not recommend staying at this hotel.",0
We stayed there because of the shuttle to airport and wasn't given the service because of covid but weren't told and still advertise it.The rooms need an urgent make over. The sofas are very old as well as the carpet,0
Advertised on their website that they have airport shuttle| but they DO NOT. when this was brought to their attention| their response was you should have called. Maybe| but if it says on  different sites that you have free shuttle| I felt confident it didn't require confirmation. So I guess call first. Also| pool and restaurant are not open!!,0
Room was really warm no aircondition was working.,0
The only thing that's about the hotel was the fact that they had a little patio sitting by the inside,0
Beautiful hotel| lovely view| the beds were small but made up with comfort| would love to stay again.,1
Pretty view n front desk lady was really sweet went out of her way to help look for a luggage cart for me.,1
My sheets had blood and what looked like snot on the pillow the shower was dirty and the room smelled like smoke,0
Our experience was not the best this time. We had stayed there before and the quality of the overall service and amenities offered were a lot better than this time. There was not enough parking no attendant to regular who was parked in there or not. They were people that staying in hotels they were parking there. When spoken to the front desk we were told to move cones and park in areas that were not safe. The conditions of the room was that it was not clean. The drapes had some kind of stain on them on the balcony it was dirty. We told the front desk and nothing was done about it. The property was disregarded the cleaning that was not there. The customer service was lacking. The whole place seems to run down and uncapped. They had one security young lady who was allowing people to come in with alcohol bottles in a lot of different parties were being held. Sanitizing stations we're not filled. There was no water offered in the rooms even though water bottles are sealed. Seems to me like everything was an excuse because of Covid. In our opinion staff was doing the minimum for the overall customer experience. The parking fee is outrageous at $36 per night. As a guest this is entirely too much considering what is offered to us. Not everyone had a parking permit. And because of the shortage of parking spaces just let me know that not everyone was paying for parking which is unfair because only the register guest had to pay.We will definitely not be staying or spending 236 A NIGHT,0
There was too much screaming allowed all over the hotel. My next door neighbors were up until 4am and no one came and said anything. They were super loud all night.,0
Ida and Gabriel were awesome...Thank you!!!,1
I'm handicapped and I had to pay for parking even though I have a placard. Also| others were parked in handicapped without having parking pass on dash or hanging on window mirror.A/C did not work. Mold in shower,0
Great stay for the value. Especially if traveling with a large family. The properly is very well kept and picturesque. Great views! Close to airport! Just wished that pool and restaurants were open though. Parking on site is expensive but worth it.,1
Property is old and furniture are old. .AC didn't work. Front desk was not friendly.,0
Overall it was great! I just didn't like that I had to pay $35.00 a night for parking. There is a walking/jogging trail so maybe that's why? I highly recommend staying here.,1
Ocean view was beautiful. Will definitely stay there again,1
It was great. Staff was very friendly and helpful.,1
Clean property with great views of the bay and surrounding area. Provided full breakfast in the morning. The bad part was the parking wasn't free and like everything else in the area the amenities were all closed due to covid. (I know it's not the hotels fault but it still made the trip worse). Overall though a very nice hotel.,1
Nice big room. Old but nice. Parking| we had to pay almost 40 a night. And had to still park far. A parking garage would be a better situation if we had to pay that amount.,1
This hotel is nice. Good for families with kids! The breakfast was good and the kids loved it.,1
Right now the little shop isn't open. If you need anything you will have to go somewhere else for supplies you forgot. The stay was stay| clean| enjoyable| and a great small getaway,1
I loved the vibe and the aesthetic of the interior of the hotel. The bay view was amazing too. Hotel rooms definitely need a remodel because they don't fit the aesthetic of the lobby and exterior. Parking should be free for guests| at least for one car.,1
Expected to have a nice relaxing staycation and we did to some extent but there was a lot ratchet people staying/parting and then the night ended with a shooting in the parking lot. Never again!,0
I had an absolutely horrible time from the time that I checked in to the time that I checked out the service was absolutely horrible and I will never stay at the Embassy suites Burlingame again. The front desk staff to the management staff was absolutely horrible,0
The hotel was lovely - the view was beautiful. The breakfast was charming and plentiful.,1
Trip was amazing.  Hotel had some cleaning issues in both our rooms but it was ok,1
No airport shuttle as advertized| breakfast was the same each morning| and the thermostate was controlled by the hotel. You could not make the room cooler. We had to sleep with the sliding glass door to the outside open just to fall asleep.,0
Hotel stay was terrible.  The front desk person was not friendly at all. You have to pay parking and if u park in back lot the doors to get in lock. I try to use my key would not work.  Hotel staff not enforcing mask wearing. No staff wiping the most popular used things like elevator inside snd out.  No limit on elevator... well not enforcing rules,0
Our first room had MOLD on the ceiling in the shower| the lamp shades were cracked and had not be cleaned in a VERY long time. We got moved to a different room the next day. That had not been cleaned at all| it still had food boxes left from the people before. Our final room was not cleaned very well either but we didnt want to move again. The beds were highly uncomfortable. The breakfast was terrible. $325 for 2 nights and it was definitely not worth that much.,0
This place was terrible. They charge me a $700 deposit and they don't tell you anywhere on any app including hotel.com and their phone app they're going to charge you $100 a day fee just to stay in the room and hold on your card which is crazy.Change the lightbulbs the first 10 minutes we were in that room| after a week stay the air conditioning didn't work for five days. I asked them to can't be an oceanfront room they refuse. They have a text deal when you have problems that you can text their number and they'll answer your problems they ignored every single text I had. They were telling us we couldn't get any clean linens and towels for seven days and they weren't going to clean the room until I called corporate then I got the room cleaned every day. They don't care about their customers it's an old fashion worst embassy suite I've ever seen in my life. It's so old they don't even have plugs to charge your phones they are 10 miles away from anything and their shuttle wasn't running so we had to walk a mile and a half to get to buses or spend a fortune on Uber every day. They don't care about the people they only care about the dollar. The food was the same day after day.The people were very nice to serve the breakfast| but it gets all the same food every single day. This is $1 billion company and I would never stay there if they can't be a room because they treated us like we didn't exist. We asked for 2000 got one little cheap van with no legs.Do not go here,0
Awesome view! Facility was nice though it needed some upgrading.,1
I've already reported this ghastly experience.Would never stay here again or suggest to friends or family,0
Worst experience ever people next door playing music all night/early morning  really loud smoking having a party smelled smoke all night coming from their room and they have the audacity to try and charge me a cleaning fee and say I'm smoking in my room I'm pregnant had my 2 kids with me how would I smoke in a room with kids and being pregnant this place is ridiculous didnt sleep until 4am and when I checked out next morning I walk pass that room making all the noise and the door is propped open with a chair and a lot of smoke smell coming out of there and bottles and cans everywhere unacceptable !!,0
It was as expected but they charged $35 a night for parking. I didn't see that advertised in the listing.,1
It was a great stay I love the scenery and the atmosphere and the staff and service was amazing I would stay there again,1
This is my second stay at this hotel and this time it was a disappointment. When we were headed up stairs to our room we realized the restroom wasn't  cleaned right or at all. The toilet had pee stains in the corner where it's visible from past visitors. The shower also had hairs left from the last people who vaccinated in the room. The restroom on the first floor in the women's restroom all the toilets were clogged and there was toilet paper everywhere. For the price I got a room was good but would never stay here again.,0
No ride to are from airport| no happy hour|breakfast terrible . Carpets dirty in room and hallways. Tv is old terrible picture . Only one person working at front desk very slow . No security . Had teenagers outside hanging out till 2am partying no one told to leave. The hotel needs to be up graded. Old and out dated,0
Very COVID safe,1
This day was lovely| I enjoyed myself even though there was smoke because we've been having fires in California so I really couldn't go outside but it was very spacious I should have told them that the air conditioner was leaking water a bit I forgot but everything else was fine The space was very big| the bathroom was lovely for what it was worth I swell the bathroom to meet their improvements but this place was more built for people who do business and work so it was a very entertaining m. Mike and council's work on their TV which is a plus they had a nice cafe but a block away the people were very nice and very helpful and all around it was a really nice place to be if you wanted to look at the view you could if you wanted to look at the ocean you could even from afar because I think every room had a balcony the inside of the core was beautiful like it was built into looking like a mall so it was lovely to be it. It was a quite relaxing trip and I really enjoyed it. They even had couches and work business-related tables and stuff they had a microwave which all rooms have a microwave a mini refrigerator so I definitely enjoyed staying there,1
I'm the policy it never stated That I had to pay $100 Deposit Fee per night up front I had 3 separate Bookings from Hotels.com. When I got there I got that surprise. Only thing they could do is give me a ‚Äúfree‚Äù parking that they charged. There was no toilet paper I had to go thru the front desk it would take up to an hr. I had also called ahead and they told me the pool was open when I got there it was Close. I asked for extra blankets to change mine and they said they only had sheets than later I see a person with Blankets. I was treated so poorly. I had a Big Group I would not recommend this hotel. It Honestly Ruined our Trip.,0
Due to Covid-19| you expect delays.  But over an hour to check in because there was 1 person at the front desk. The room itself I felt was sufficiently clean.  Breakfast| another hour long line.  There needs to be changes made for the Pandemic but it's still new so I'm sure they're working on it.  Social distancing not really followed by others staying there.  But I guess they are avoiding confrontation.,1
Awesome place room is clean and comfortable we feel good with the atmosphere specially on shore side walkway,1
Nice looking hotel and clean rooms.  Views of the bay are pretty.  Staff was overwhelmed and certainly let everyone know so.  Booked a suite for 2 adults and 3 kids and it was an absolute battle to get 5 total pillows for the room.  Other guests staying there were unruly| sounded like a daycare being run above our room.  Parking area didn't prevent people that were not guests of the hotel from staying out.  Difficult to find a good safe parking spot at $35 a night.  Want to circle back around to the extremely rude concierge.  She argued with how many people I booked the room for in the fight for the 5th pillow.  When I went down later with proof of my reservation for 5| new concierge gave me 2 additional pillows and a towel no problem.,0
The room was clean and spacious. kinda outdated though. needs new carpeting. other than that| we had a great 2 night stay. my highlite is the perfect bay view.,1
Beautiful bay view. Clean and quiet hotel. We love staying at Embassy Suites.,1
It was very nice. We just love the view. Second time we've been there and we're from NM.,1
The restaurant isn't open so they had no room service food available.  Breakfast was cold scrambled eggs and uncooked sausages.,1
Honestly the property is a safe family oriented business. The room's can use an upgrade a lot of ware and tare. However the beds r perfect very comfortable,1
I loved my stay here! Everyone was super nice| the inside of the hotel was so pretty| loved all the green trees and the water fountains.The room were really clean. I wished the pool was open but totally understand because of Covid-19 it was closed. Definitely will stay here again.,1
Embassy suites was great| very clean. The bed wasn't so great but all in all it was fine,1
This place has parties going on until 4 am and nothing being done about it. We found old food under our bed and cockroaches in the room and old gum stuck to the wall. And we all got bed bug bites| just a horrible stay.,0
Water view was really nice| plus the breakfast in the morning!,1
Everything was great. Friendly staff and nice amenities. We will be back,1
Staff was friendly and made accommodations for me and my wife when the Expedia website made a mistake. Super clean and close to the ocean. This is my go hotel when I stay In the Bay Area.,1
Due to COVID things were not as good as they could be.  I requested our room be cleaned daily but that didn't happen.  They only cleaned our room once in our 3 day stay.  They did serve a breakfast consisting of scrambled eggs| sausages and breakfast potatoes.  Also coffee and juice and muffin or toast.  Had to eat in your room though.  Understandable with COVID.  The hotel is clean but could use some remodeling in the rooms.  The bar and restaurant was closed so it is a little difficult to give a fair review.,1
Has a great ocean view! Had very spacious room for the price,1
Ok I am pretty FLEXIBLE and understand things going on especially with COVID19 but after a long day of driving| wanted to rest and wanted my kiddos to let me relax and they could watch some TV| well the TV was not working.Seriously that should be something you check the room for| clean bathroom| clean sheets| working TV...seriously people!The manager apologized and they gave me a discount and I appreciate it but come on | TV is a basic thing they should make sure it works.,0
No buffet breakfast anymore.  I understand why.  Everything else was great,1
There was a line of 12 people waiting to check in at 5 PM and only 1 desk person.  Sad.,1
The place was at the perfect location and very clean!,1
The property was clean and well kept. My room and amenities were up to my expectations with the exception that my room did not have a shower curtain. Overall| enjoyed my stay,1
Very nice and quiet and beautiful scenery!!!!!!!!!,1
Breakfast sucked| only cold prepared bags were servedI called the front desk around 1am to complain about noises coming from the suite next to mine ( people were having a party apparently ) and I had a baby and an elderly mom who couldn't sleep because of that| management did nothing about itParking is waaaay too expensive ($35) for a self parking in their property which doesn't even guarantee safety for you ur vehicle I could've parked anywhere else and taken uber to the hotel and it would have cost me $5-$6 insteadThis parking fee is mentioned on their website and on expedia but you can easily miss itFinally the manager was rude when I asked her to consider waving the parking fee she said : quoting her ‚Äú I AM NOT WAVING THE PARKING FEE ‚Äúwell... fair enough| you just lost a customer who will review that on your website and on expedia,0
We had to switch rooms twice because they were unclean. All of their amenities offered on the web page were not available. They would not offer an upgrade or lower price for the false advertising. I always try to stay at Embassy for the value and atmosphere.  We made the decision to not to stay again. Bad management?,0
Understanding of Covid pandemic that services were refused| but this hotel was horrible. Dirty dishes left in the hallway for days. Letter in room says they don't service the room unless asked| if you ask they say they are not servicing the rooms. Dirty towels and sheets are find second day but by the third - fifth it's a bit gross,0
I called and booked this room and they assured me that all amenities were going to be the same at this property. Got there and they weren't ! Total rip off for the price! Breakfast was a banana stale muffin and a granola bar!   The entry way and elevator was filthy! Looked smelled like alcohol was spilled all over the floor. Elevator windows were filthy! This is a Hilton hotel?? Omg!? This place looked like skid row! Teens running around drinking drunk half dressed this is supposed to be a upper level hotel! NOT! There was even a huge raccoon in the parking lot hissing at me!!,0
Nothing was available and I wasn't notified until I got there. I reserved my room with certain exceptions and we didn't get any of them. The room was very clean and comfortable. Called several times for clean towels before they finally told my husband we had to come get them ourselves. It was our anniversary weekend and just wanted to get away üò™.,0
It was a good stay. Close to the water so I saw a lot of people walking around the property.,1
I Enjoyed my mothers day weekend. The view was the highlight of the room for me.,1
There customer service was on point especially during this tuff time with Covid 19 very respectful staff very clean and presentable hotel will be coming back,1
Very limited service| but understandabledue to corona virus. What made this stay so bad is the charge of 35 dollars for parking a night| probably my fault for not checking but with a charge this high  I would like to know since I did have options. I would think the clerk would tell me about this while checking in| not at check out.the parking charge was about the same as a third of the cost. will never stay there again since,0
Price & location| unlimited brkfast is the best so as happy hour too,1
When i asked about Free shuttle before I have reservation| they said ‚ÄúYes| you can use it‚Äù.After I finish to pay| they suddenly changed their word that the shuttle is not operate right now. What the heck....! I paid for Uber to get there.,0
Due to corona nothing was open and the staff were very stand-off ish.,0
We were very impressed. The rooms are large and the breakfast buffet is outstanding. Great value,1
At checkin they had no reservation for us. Gave them confirmation # and they still could not find our reservation. They asked us to call hotel.com to reconfirm.  I emailed the hotel my confirmation. F8nally after an hour we were given our prepaid hotel room.  Very frustrating !,1
It was great.  Nice property| plenty to keep kids busy.,1
It's close to SFO and there's plenty of dining options.,1
The refrigerator was cold enough found a box of chinese food in the refrigerator that wasn't cold...I asked for dirty clothes bag....,1
Excellent service and condition. Shower sprayer came apart and they had it fixed in 10 minutes. Great reception cocktails and breakfast was outstanding. Will be back on next San Fran trip.,1
"The inside features an ""Atrium""| something you would not expect from the outside. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I forgot my shaving cream and a comb. They had just what I needed free of charge at the front desk. My King Suite was very spacious. Very close to airport and the free shuttle to it was a dream.",1
Being charged $35 for parking|for a couple of hours is a rip off.Complimentary happy hour is great|  but the snacks could be better.Nice breakfast.,1
I love Embassy Suites Burlingame! I've been coming here for years and it never disappoints. I've tried staying at other Embassy Suites in the Bay Area and no other location is as nice as this one. Definitely worth a stay and the location by the ocean is pristine.,1
We paid extra for a Bay View Room and was given a view of the outside wall. Also the AC wouldn't even turn on and had to be serviced. Also the Living room TV didn't work and was told by maintenance that it couldn't be fixed. The Manage wouldn't do nothing about it because they were booked up and had a bad attitude,0
This place has really gone downhill!! First off they started charging $35 for parking a night? Why?  The first night the sofa couch mattress felt like a mattress with springs so uncomfortable!  The next day I attempted to get a hold of the mgr several times.  Never return my calls left on the phone or when given to him by the employees.  Got back to the hotel the supervisor comes out with a total attitude.  He switched our room to a double bed.  The air did not work and the window did not close which helped since it felt like a sauna because it was so hot!  Again the mattress on the couch was horrible my BF threw the couch pillows on top so he could sleep on top of that instead on the bed of springs!  Never coming back! I should of picked the Four Point Sheraton in South City which I had been doing,0
The lobby area is lovely and the breakfast is great!,1
how easy it was the was no problems at all the whole time,1
The view was great| staff was friendly. Rooms are large but the bathrooms  are small.  Noticed many people smoking off their balconies when we entered. Sure enough| our room smelled like smoke. It wasn't horrible but you could tell it used to be a smoking room at some point. Bed was decent| plenty of parking.,1
If i will go back to san Francisco for another vacation i love to choose embassy suites over again| from employees to the whole services and  the hotel itself it's vert very accommodating..,1
The breakfast was sensational! The front desk was friendly and helpful. I wish I didn't get charged an early check in fee since a room was ready for me.,1
We shall definitely come back! Great place. Staff and food excellent!!!!,1
Overall my stay was a good one. Nice property. One negative was that housekeeping did not clean our room the second day.,1
Bathroom need to be cleaned.,1
Extremely hot in the room thermostat felt like it was not working.,0
Everything was great at this location! The free happy hour  was a plus and you got a full free breakfast in the morning that was filling,1
need to pay 35:00 for overnight parking no good breakfast,0
I love this place and have been staying there for over 30 years. However| the rooms need a good remodeling.,1
Excellent service| warm indoor pool | beautiful scenery we even found a place  where we had church it was amazing to stay,1
Clean| lots of space in the rooms. Friendly staff.,1
Nice waterfront hotel.  Convenient location for a family when visiting San Francisco.  There are lot of nice restaurants in downtown Burlingame as well.The only issue we had was the room was too hot| and setting the thermostat to lower didn't make it cooler.,1
Excellent service| food and staff friendly| nice warm in door pools very nice,1
Great service| beautiful facilities. My kids loved it too.,1
Great courtyard| complimentary breakfast| happy hour. Great for family - indoor pool,1
It was overall a good stay. The shower wasn't too clean. It was stained quite a bit. The breakfast was good,1
Overall the Embassy is great; I stay here if possible whenever I'm in the Burlingame area.  The amenities are all awesome| service wonderful| rooms well kept| etc.  My only complaint is that there were NO usb outlets in the room.  Usually there's at least one outlet that is USB| either on the nightstand (usually part of the lamp) or at the desk area (since you're likely to have your computer here).  This room had none.  Not a single one.  Luckily the other hotel where the event I was attending was being held had free charging stations available.  Normally I have no complaints whatsoever| but a premium suite with an office area should| at this day and age| have an outlet ready to go for USB devices.,1
They have such an amazing complimentary breakfast and complimentary drink..Staffs are very friendly and prompt,1
Great location but very annoyed to be charged $32 per night for parking and find out when you are leaving.  NO INDICATION OF THIS CHARGE| they asked if you had a car and gave me a pass to put on the car in a wide open parking area with NO COVERED CAR PARK or anything to indicate you were to be charged.,1
So upset with the whole stay| hair in the bathtub | clogged tub| stain on the cups| sand in the extra blanket | paid for a view but got side building view when i called they said that's all they have available | you pay more for parking then in Las Vegas.. Checking out the lady didn't even look up | asked for rm# handed me the bill and kept looking at the computer . I don't do reviews | we all have good days bad days| and not everything is perfect .. but these guys | a whole another level of unprofessional ‚Äú I HAVE NO INTEREST OF HELPING YOU ! The night manager even told us if  we are not happy with the room we can go and find somewhere cheeper and maybe with a view ... again | maybe just a wrong day to be checking in with the wrong people | but i paid for my stay | i did not book for free so to take what ever is given to me !,0
We like happy hour and the free breakfast. Helps create a more relaxing stay.,1
The rooms and breakfast was great. But the pool area and the work out area was not stocked on water and toilet paper for the rest room.,1
The friendliness and courtesy of the staff was excellent. The only issue I had was finding a table to sit at during breakfast on a Sunday morning.,1
Nice hotel with a very good free breakfast. Clean and a very nice staff and accommodating.,1
There's only fan| no aircondition so we opened the window.,1
Overall| the staff was kind and respectful. However| on my last day there| the driver of the shuttle to the airport was uncaring and rude. My arm is currently in a sling and I was visibly struggling to get my luggage together upon his announcement. He kept looking at me| waiting while I was struggling. I finally asked for his assistance and he seemed annoyed and the only thing he said to me was ‚ÄúNO FOOD OR DRINK! YOU CANNOT COME ON SHUTTLE!‚Äù I said ‚Äúokay| and finished everything for as quickly as possible and when I turned around| he was in the shuttle just waiting for me.,1
The staff was courteous. The hotel was clean and well maintained. Our room was spacious and comfortable,1
Front Staff was worst and requested room was not available.,0
This is not the first time we stayed at Embassy suites hotels. The suites conveniently sleeps 4| but the bathroom in this hotel needs more hooks to hang towels. The buffet breakfast is pretty good| although the one in LA near Disneyland is so much better.,1
THE HOTEL WAS WELL MAINTAINED THE AMENITIES WERE GOOD THE ONLY THING THAT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IS THE MATRESS IT WAS SOME WHAT UNCOMFORTABLE I COULD FEEL THE THE SPRINGS.,1
Great & friendly service,1
Breezed into town for a Friday night overnight stay| and was quite pleased with hospitable staff| large clean rooms| and  serene atmosphere! Loved walking right from hotel to SF Bay| find my spot on the dock| and watch the tide roll away!,1
This hotel is beautiful and the renovations are very nice. The only complaint was the couch bed. Those who slept on the couch beds mentioned that they felt the bars all night long. We had four rooms. Besides that| everything else was what you expect from a Hilton property,1
The courtyard was great and the location amazing. I wasn't happy that housekeeping only left face towels and no bath towels. I went down to request them at the front desk and after an hour still no bath towels. So I went back down and the guy apologized and asked me to give him a minute to go upstairs to find a pair of towels. Apparently they had run out of towels.,1
We like the trail behind the hotel. For morning breakfast| we don't like that certain fruits were not replenished and tables were not clean after guests left.,1
THEY CHARGE TOO MUCH FOR PARKING|I THOUGHT ANY HOTEL MUST HAVE PARKING FACILITY,1
I booked a king bed room| the room smells| and the bed has two hair. It is obviously that they didn't change the sheet after the last costumer checked out!! It's  Disgusting!!! And then I went to the receptionist| the woman receptionist was very rude! She said that all the king bed rooms were sold out! And she can switch me to a double twin bed room. Well!!! It was pretty empty that night! Tuesday night! Anyway! Will never go back to this place again!!!,0
The raccoons on the property were everywhere even at the front door.,0
Nothing was open but front desk was friendly and helpful| beds were comfy and room was clean if not a little older.,1
Great location right on the water. Beautiful views! I picked a bay front room and it was loud at times from planes landing and taking off. Check in and check out was quick and hassle free. Breakfast was delicious! Loved the made to order omelet and breakfast buffet. The room was cold and was told they had central heating. They offered a space heater but it never came. I just turned off the air and bundled up as much as possible.,1
When we checked in we were told  we had rooms next to each other. I confirmed one had disabled facilities and was told the one room was now not ready and to return after 20 minutes.We went to our room on the 8th floor with an excellent view but assured our dauughter that hers would be exactly the same next doorOn returning after 20 minutes we were allocated a room on the 4th floor the other end of the hotelBecause she had not read the reservation properly she built up our hopes of a perfect visit to yhis hotel,1
The beds and pillows were outdated and lumpy. None of us slept well,0
Easy to check in and everyone was so helpful ...very clean and a kids freiendy hotel,1
Rooms nice clean & comfortable. Guest services staff helpful. Had the misfortune to arrive at evening hospitality time & it was chaos with tables littered with glasses| Chips & rubbish|with children running wild. Not the hotels fault l might add but one to avoid at times  !. Breakfast next morning was slightly more organised.,1
Spacious| well-appointed room. Very complete breakfast served in pleasant and welcoming atrium which seemed like a park. Very convenient to SFO with access to excellent walking paths along waterfront.,1
It is old | dirty | and they didn't clean the room 2 days of our stay And I didn't like Expedia service too,0
I love this hotel. Location| being able to bring my pet| a restaurant on site(w/good food)| Happy Hour| and a beautiful atrium.,1
Beautiful view of the bay and we liked the open court yard,1
Embassy Suites is always a favorite of mine.  This one did not disappoint.   Nice and clean accommodations as a good price,1
The room was perfect for my 95 year old mother! Could have used a b,1
I enjoyed the breakfast in the morning. Everyone was very friendly at check in.,1
Location was perfect! Beautiful and well kept hotel. Breakfast was good| would have enjoyed more variety.,1
Nice view| nice hotel and very quiet area and free shuttle from airport,1
The fan in the bathroom was too noisy. The bed is is i,0
Great hotel for the price. I would stay here again. The rooms were clean| and the beds were comfortable. The continental breakfast was much more than expected. I didn't realize there was a parking fee. Granted| there were signs| and in the end| we would have paid it. It was just a surprise. Also| when we checked in| house keeping was cleaning the rooms and they were placing all the used garbage bags right by our door. I might suggest finding another spot to place the garbage instead of by the rooms you're checking folks into.,1
The property has very bad soundproofing doors and walls. We booked executive studio| and the room next door was partying till 2-3am with loud music and talking we can hear clearly. Very poor service - it took more than half an hour for the security person to reach out to the party next door| and they still continued. No resolution.,0
Very nce hotel. Like the location on the waterfront.,1
Dry nice| clean and everyone was so helpful. The views of the bay were amazing.,1
Great value for the price . Location was close to San Francisco and they also offer a trolley to the downtown area.,1
Great places to  stay  I love the breakfast  Is such a good  u service,1
The hotel and staff great| sofa bed terrible| other bed great| breakfast really enjoyable and happy hour real bonus| children  for happy hour not really  looked after,1
Rooms were oldBathroom doors never closedBreakfast lobby was extremely crowded with no place to sit,0
We waited almost an hour for the free shuttle from the airport and it never arrived.  The front  desk staff were not helpful when we called to ask about the timing for the shuttle.  The beds sagged in the middle| the shower was clogged| there were not enough towels and housekeeping had to be called twice to get them.  The staff who manned the free breakfast were excellent!   We watched them deal with a large number of guests all with very special requests.  They made every effort to please the guests.,0
I loved the hotel beautiful view and place very good service loved Aida on front desk she was very helpful And something very unique was their breakfast so delicious never had a breakfast like that in another hotel my family and me were very pleased with this hotel!!! 5‚≠êÔ∏è,1
Great hotel.  The area is very nice| fun view of the Bay.  Great cocktail our and a good breakfast.,1
Property is clean but very loud due to proximity to airport however the pull out beds are in desperate need of replacement.  Food at restaurant is sub par at bestStaff is fantastic! Rooms are clean but dated,0
Had a great time and the staff went above and beyond to make our stay great. Even gave my husband a birthday card and chocolates for his birthday.,1
The bed I could feel the boxsprings through my back very very uncomfortable sleep I just felt staying at a higher in hotel would allow me to have at least a decent bed this one had the box springs going to the mattress typical Motel six bed other than that it was OK was really shocked though that I had to pay $37 per night to park on there at grounds,0
The Room that I booked was booked for someone else at the same time I was ‚ÄúUpgraded‚Äù to a premium room which had less from the original room I booked. The room inside had hair in the shower and a puddle on the carpet. The original room that I both had a Bayview| in the room that I was upgraded to was a view of the parking lot.My family had flown in December the square board and landed at almost 1030 so needless to say we did not want to go to another hotel.,0
Breakfast was phenomenal.  Very nice to jump out on walking path and walk along the bay.,1
Excellent service just the charge for the parking 32 dls was a little expensive.The breakfast was excellent for free ‚ò∫Ô∏è,1
The customer service was outstanding. Everyone was so helpful| really outstanding!,1
I really appreciate the breakfast & airport shuttle.,1
This was a last minute reservation 15hrs ahead of check in and to be frank I got an awesome deal for all the facilities they provided. Pet friendly and awesome setting| surroundings and neighbourhood. Only request I have to the hotel is keep up the good work but people coming in with pets will be happy to have their rooms on the main or the next one up for easy access to go outside and do their job. A good majority of the pets do not see lift on a day to day basis and they would be frightened to death with close surroundings.,1
Clean and service  dry good People are always available for you and the food was great,1
I like that this hotel is actually on the bay. Great pathways to walk. However| the pathways at night are not well lit| so it's not really safe to walk or stroll.,1
Nice bay front path to walk or run. Free airport shuttle to take to Bart line or the free Burlingame shuttle to take you to Caltrain. Free ample breakfast every morning and happy hour in evening.,1
This place is always nice like all the other embassy. You know what you're getting when you stay here. Free half hour and breakfast is worth the extra price. It's also really close to coyotes point and the airport,1
Very nice hotel and convenient shuttle ti airport.,1
A safe place to rest peacefully A well designed concept with a wide open center for the court food and entertainment,1
I was not given option to choose a room. The room provided has balcony but it's covered with tall trees. The smell of the room is terrible maybe because the carpet is wet from the previous guests who used the swimming pool. The bathroom tub is clogged and dirty. The coffee maker is broken and the replacement was not provided even after I requested.  Almost all staff don't smile and looked overworked. The hotel has an event that sells shoes inside the hotel rooms in different floors. It looks like a market and privacy is compromised. I questioned my final bill because I was charged of WiFi which supposed to be free. No one helps with the luggage. The hotel is very expensive but it's not worth the price,0
The air conditioning was not working. Hot inside the room,0
We staying in Room 733 above the Tavern. We were awaken at 3:00 a.m. from which sounded like a very loud argument.,1
Enjoyed our stay there. Would definetely stay again if in the area,1
Beautiful| peaceful view| well groomed appearance.,1
I liked everything except the check in process because it took a long time. The reason was not finding my booking. It was not my mistake.,1
Beautiful scenery and spacious rooms.  I always enjoy my stays here with the bay view and great breakfast.,1
They loved the pksce,1
Everything was great especially the staff| pool| and cleanliness. For being at the airport| it was quiet. We enjoyed our visit.,1
We had a pleasant at the Embassy Suite. Our flight was delayed so I called the hotel to have us pre-check in|  The room was ready for us when we arrived past midnight.  The breakfast is awesome and the evening happy hour was lovely.,1
Room is large and adequate but the bathroom is too small,1
The condition of this hotel was disgusting.  The floor was dirty| the shower had black mold all over| and the paint was peeling from the ceiling.  For over $200 a night I would have expected to stay in a much cleaner hotel.,0
The hotel and breakfast were great but I was surprised to see how expensive parking was given that it wasn't downtown,1
I enjoyed the large and open indoor courtyard with complimentary breakfast and evening reception.  The rooms were clean and spacious.  The televisions| although there were two in the suite were on the smaller size and rather old.,1
Loved the area| the trail that was there is beautiful.  The amenities were great.  Loved the happy hour offered.  Great food for breakfast,1
We liked the location|  the room and the fresh breakfast.  We didn't  like the fact that there were no dress code regulations for guests to attend breakfast. We saw families in pyjamas and others I'm wrapped pool towels.  It was disgusting.,1
It is not pleasant being ignored by staff when attempting to check in. Also a reservation doesn't mean much apparently| as they will switch you to other rooms if you arrive in the evening.,0
The overall ambience was very nice. The Tap room needs a better menu and the food was not very good. The waiter was very flustered because there were so many of us. He forgot one item we ordered.,1
The stay was great had great breakfast and service everyone was very nice. The only problem I had was I was charged more than I was supposed to be charged and additional fees I was not aware of. Also I don't even know what the fees are for because I have to wait 5 days for a receipt.,1
Did not have hot water in the room.  After an hour| maintenance had it fixed| but lost hot water again later and had ti take a cold shower...Blow dryer in room was completely covered in some sticky substance.  Carpet was sticky in spots| gross.,0
Great location| very comfortable| and attentive staff. Property is undergoing some renovations| but they did not affect the stay. Restaurants are not walking distance. But great food was a short Uber ride away.,1
Overall Great Stay. Vey clean and had a great scenery around the hotel.,1
We enjoyed our stay here. Our room was really spacious and very clean. There location is perfect. We are only (very) disappointed about the self parking charge| which is $32/night. It is very very expensive and would have been good if Expedia indicated this amount on the hotel's page.,1
"We chose this hotel because there was an event at the hotel and wanted to enjoy without worrying about driving back home...and thought a 1-night ""staycation"" would be a nice break.  We were early for check-in and they had a room available. (Awesome! But that was it.) The suite had a funky odor throughout as if the mini-fridge had rotten food in it.  We called down for extra towels and pillows two separate instances. Both times nothing showed up for over 1.5 hours! At 1130pm| finally went to the front desk for a face-to-face...still took 30 mins to get towels and another 10 mins more for pillows.  The tv kept freezing every 10-15 mins.  No reason to call to report an issue with the tv/cable if they cannot even deliver towels in a reasonable amount of time.  Big suite & nice view if you like watching planes land at the airport. Small| cheap pillows & suite needs to be renovated (really)!  If you want decent customer service or a relaxing ""getaway"" for a night or more| this is probably NOT the best choice...especially since this area has lots of other choices!  It was NOT worth the amount of money spent and would not consider returning to this location again.",0
The room was exquisite.  The service from the front desk was friendly but felt hurried.  The lady at the souvenir shop was EXTREMELY rude.  Please hire someone with a friendlier disposition.  It is a bit far from the action in San Francisco (around a $60 Uber ride) but it is so peaceful and if you like seeing plane land and take off| it is a dream come true.,1
Great hotel| wonderful staff| with a great view. Only issue was that the stucco above one of the beds was chipping| not enough coffee| no stirrers| beds were small for 2 people| but besides that everything else was nice.,1
Location I like. Interior and furnishings are dated.,1
Hyatt in SFO is way better overall in service and hotel facilities,0
Happy hour| indoor swimming pool. The staff were very friendly and helpful.,1
Price was awesome but service & room was not great. I received a crib for my infant only to come out broken| didn't bother to change. Lights did not work| no ventilation in queen bed room. Did not bring pillows as requested & also charged extra on who knows what at the end of our stay. Knowing it was part Hilton was disappointing because we have never experienced such lack on so many things felt like we were at a cheap  motel honestly.,0
The tv in a $500 a night suite didn't work & couldn't be fixed. The walls were banged up. A large group of teenagers were not well-behaved even though they they adult chaperones. Very disturbing.,0
Our trash cans under the sink (two) were full of trash.. it smelled.| they forgot to empty them out.,1
Not exactly our room 316 aircon was not working properly,0
Really disappointed in our 'Bay View'. I guess if that means getting to look out a filthy window to a cigarette butt-covered rooftop and a sliver of the bay| then that was on point. Would have gone for a less-expensive option if I knew that's what I was paying for but we really wanted to take advantage of the location and view! Couldn't call down to the front desk to check why our TV kept going out as the phone in the living room didn't work. We used the other in the room and were told they weren't sure| try turning it off. Also disappointed no wifi unless you're a Hamptons Member| $250+/night for a room isn't enough for wifi AND a room.  Unfortunate about some of the hiccups because we had great service and food from Gabriel in the restaurant| enjoyed the cocktail hour and breakfast and really liked the surrounding area. Great walking paths| pretty area| quick to airport service.,1
The room was a bit humid and warm| but the staff was helpful in providing added fans to cool off the room.,1
Good times,1
Amazing hotel. Luxurious| comfortable and spacious suite. Extremely comfortable bed. Amazing breakfast and complimentary happy hour! LOVED IT!,1
We had a good stay The staff was amazing and helped us as much as they could. They were super friendly. A few issues we had were the first room The floor was wet when we got there at 1am and still wet when we got up. They did give us a new room which was supposed to be bay view but it was on the second floor and overlooked a roof with a ton of cigarette butts just outside our window. It was super gross. The tub didn't drain either but they came and fixed it for us.  Otherwise the room was great we just kept the blinds closed. The breakfast was amazing. All on all it was a great stay. I would stay here again‚ò∫Ô∏è,1
I asked for a towel and never got it.  Not enough towels and pillows.,1
The hotel was great. We ran into some problems not being able to contact housekeeping and the front desk for fresh towels and extra pillows. The bathroom was also mediocre. Bathtub was slightly dirty and big crack in the mirror. However these were all minor things. They had an excellent breakfast buffet| pool| staff was friendly and views were perfect. Wild stay again.,1
We had a great time. Breakfast was yummy there was alot of choices the evening reception was fun Billy the bartender was awesome. The room was clean the beds were comfortable. The employees were friendly.,1
The suite was really nice but the bed sucked. You guys need to upgrade the mattress!,1
Had a wonderful time!!! Come to this hotel often and would always recommend it!! Such a great place! Really enjoyed my stay and the room was excellent along with the outstanding customer service!!!,1
The hotel is in a very scenic and quiet area. Amenities are awesome. Maid could have cleaned up cups and other things better. Overall awesome hotel.,1
Nice environment around and in the hotel. Room is clean and spacious. Free breakfast and shuttle bus to the airport. 20min drive to downtown. The only thing is that parking is quite expensive considering it's not close to downtown,1
Will definitely stay there again in the future.,1
Breakfast| and cocktail hour was great. $35/night to park was a little steep.,1
Very nice hotel with beautiful view of the bay and planes landing and taking off.,1
great place for families to stay.  Excellent buffet breakfast,1
I enjoyed the hotel overall however the water from the shower did not want to drain.,1
Room was very unclean...,0
the breakfast place was big but not big enough|there was a waiting line and it was impossible to find a seat.why force everybody before 9 o'clock?,1
I always love Embassy Suites,1
Great view| I like that we could fit our whole family in one room| with the couch bed.,1
It was very good. Hotel was very comfortable. Breakfast was excellent as well,1
Location to city. Easy off on of highway| only short drive to San Francisco. Like evening reception time. Great morning buffet.,1
Wi-fi is terrible and the staff isn't able to help,0
The location is great| with a nice area to walk around the bay. A very nice view of the area.,1
This is NOT the Embassy Suite comfort that I'm used to. The management would do well to renovate.,0
Hotel was nice and large common area. Breakfast good| pool too small for the size of the hotel and we had to wait to swim. Wish the bathroom wasn't off the bedroom but overall was a good stay.,1
This was a good property to stay at. Loved the view and the staff,1
Breakfast was great and staff friendly the bar was rather expensive,0
Check in was late due to room not being ready given i had already arrive 1 hour after check in time. swimming pool was horribly packed and badly managed and  my kids were not able to get in at all. Staff at this embassy suites was not as friendly as others i have been to. Positives were location to airport only 4 minutes away which was convenient for us. Breakfast was great| rooms were in excellent condition. overall i always look at the service to determine if i will be returning and unfortunately i will not be booking again at this site.,0
Like everything Just couldn't get extra coffee and cups in the room.,1
Full size beds| little small for 2 people. Beds  Need to be made larger. Sell it for 6 people and would make it more comfortable. Otherwise was ok,1
Nice pool with plenty of towels & fitness room with good view.,1
Close to transportation|  nice view | quite| good breakfast,1
Great hotel| we love love it !!!,1
The water was so slow that the shower was not working properly & it took them the whole day to get us big towels for the bathroom,1
Everything was good except they messed up on our room.we booked a king bed but were sent to a two full bed.so we had to come back down and had to wait for them to find a room for us.otherwise everything was good.the buffet was excellent,1
The room are cold and staffs stated they only give out portable heaters. He stated the building is old and nothing can be done. He reported that everyone uses the heaters and why do I have issues,0
Wow such a Beautiful hotel  our family loved it!!,1
Convenient location near the airport with free shuttle service. Bed options and breakfast were good per Americans standards. Great surprise was the complimentary happy hour drinks and snack in the evening. Front desk staff were great and let us check in early as soon as we arrived.,1
We were downgraded from guaranteed bay view to ‚Äúlagoon‚Äù view. The lagoon looked oddly like a parking lot. $40 was taken off of our stay but we wouldn't have booked or been willing to pay that much if our hands weren't tied (it was late and we were already there| we weren't up for looking for somewhere else to stay.) Our room was run-down with a number of broken or not working items| including the shower. The fold out couch was horrible- without any hyperbole the worst I've ever felt. The ‚Äúmattress‚Äù was comically thin. The pool was packed with kids jumping onto each other| various speakers blasting music| and people drinking beer in the hot tub. There were no towels or anyone enforcing any of the posted rules. I had to pull my kids out of the water out of safety concerns. We will not be returning. I've stayed at a number of wonderful| less expensive places in the area and will be giving them my business again.,0
That we had to leave before the  complementary  breakfast. Would have been nice to have had some before we left. Other then that it was great,1
Check in was easy and food at the hotel was good,1
Hotel is good large rooms good breakfast judt the parking i ask for a parking pass no one told me that you have to pay $30 per night for parking too much!! Beware of parking fees,1
Overall great! I prefer a firm mattress over a soft mattress| but it wasn't a deal breaker.,1
It was nice. Enjoyed our stay. Staff was friendly and went out of their wY for us.,1
We stayed in Burlingame and drove to the city| the hotel was very conveniently located| the rooms were comfortable and breakfast always delicious!,1
This place was amazing.The inside of the hotel was very beautiful.The rooms are nice and big.The breakfast was phenomenal.,1
This is my second time staying here and the towel situation is not getting any better. We had four adults in our room along with two children and were only left three bath towels| when I requested an additional four towels I was only brought up three. Overall the stay was good the free breakfast was a delight| from the staff to the seating I enjoyed that perk.,1
I love this hotel. I love the buffet breakfast included.It's very accommodating. Relaxing too. The rooms are clean and comfortable. I can't wait to book again and thank you Expedia added my points.üòÄI definitely recommend it to everyone.,1
The hotel is great and the staff very friendly. Loved the reception and the breakfast buffet. Tried the restaurant in the hotel and the fresh made food and view to the bay as your dining is fabolous. The room very cleaned and accomodating. Do wish we received some spanish channels options on the tv. The swimming pool was nice| however very full with the kids clubs on site. For families or adults| I would recommend to have the camps come within a set schedule rather than all at once with the rest of the hotel guest.,1
Openess of hotel.  Separate bedroom with sofa bed in living room.  Great breakfast,1
Beautiful hotel. Amazing view! Great service. Very happy with the stay.,1
Wonderful breakfast and room - only disappointing thing was not enough towels for the number of people registered to stay in the room,1
Indoor pool is very nice. And the bay view is great.,1
The breakfast was really good| the reception could of been better. The reception had the same snacks every day.In our room which was room 240| when it rained you can hear the water falling between the walls which was in our room and the bathroom. It might of been a rain gutter located there.,1
Room was not ready at 3:00 PM check in.   Front desk personnel said they would call when it was ready.   I was never called so we just went back several hours later and it was good to go.   I asked why I was not called and the person did not have an answer.   Pool was very crowded with kids out of control and not enough adults supervision.   Too many above the posted capacity so I took my kids out for safety.,1
The trip was fantastic! Well above my expectations for the price. Close enough to the city to drive in enjoy the sites but enough that you can avoid the noise and chaos! The woman at the front desk was superb! We will be coming back.,1
I love the complimentary snacks/beverages  and breakfast. The view from our 9th floor room is breathtaking. Easy access to food and shopping.,1
We stayed here as a stop-over on a road trip to Disneyland. It was a beautiful waterfront location (not a beach| though). Pool and gym were great and so was the happy hour. The restaurant inside was also delicious and had a fantastic view. Would stay here again. Only thing was that they almost double charged us upon arrival.  They told me I hadn't paid through hotels.com and I had to show them my receipt to prove I had.,1
There's an Awesome Waterfront view and walkway for strolls,1
Beautiful| Spacious|  and friendly!  Parking was a little hard to find| it was Very full. Excellent breakfast. LOVED the room. Will definitely be back.,1
Great staff and ambience is maintained. Always come back !,1
Excellent choice for family stay!,1
Lovely property. The only negative was the room was too warm to sleep and we couldn't control the temperature due to central air. They did bring us a fan once we complained but it was disappointing to not get a good night sleep.,1
Great check in process. Room conditions were fine. Great place for families.,1
I love the locations| friendly staff| rooms are clean and good size. I really like the room door separation from the room and the cozy seating area. Great complimentary drinks| snack| and buffet breakfast. My only complain will be that| they should not allowed some  many people in one room... Pool area crowed. overall| great experience.,1
I requested food to the room and they brought me Burnt bread,1
"Since when do hotel charge you to check in early??  I attempted to check in at 1 PM and was told| ""your room is available"".  Great news!!  This was followed by ""but it will cost you $50 to check in now--check in time is 4PM.  What poor customer relations.  It would not cost the hotel anything to let me check in 3 hours early--but it certainly has cost them my respect by trying to charge me for this privilege.  To be fair--an hour later when I realized I had gold status with Hilton and approached the desk with this information I was given the key to my room with no charge.  Since I had booked with hotels.com my Hilton number was not on the reservation.",0
Service and cleanness of the hotel. Definitely I will book again.,1
We stayed for just one night as we were transiting through SFO. The hotel is a little older| but the pool and restaurant were great. Ken the waiter in the restaurant was possibly the most helpful and wonderful employee. He went above and beyond to get me what I needed and always a big smile on his face.,1
Family of five. Sofa bed so worn you can feel the steel bars. Two of us slept on the floor. Airconditioning noisy| room smelly.  Other two beds very small for two people. I don't understand how they have a review score over 4. Seems false to me as I stay in a lot of hotels. Never slept on the floor!,0
I really loved this place everything was just right,1
Horrible service| I asked for a heater 3 times and they just said ‚Äúsomeone is on the way‚Äù no one showed up and me and my family spend the night freezing. Also| they always add extra fees to your car which they requires as deposit. Will never stay there again.,0
Good stay...the room was clean and spacey. The gym was very outdated but other than that we had a good stay.,1
The location of this hotel and the convenience of it's airport shuttle make it a perfect place to stay.  The free breakfast options are incredible....will even cook you a make-to-order omelet.  Of course the free happy hour is a plus!,1
I did the reservation with a king bed| the receptionist blame Expedia for offering a room that was not supposed to be offer and change us to a double queen bed room| $29.00 for parking? When I said whaaat??? Clerk answered ‚Äúthis is the bay area‚Äù so I told him well since you are changing us to a different room than the one we were promise| shouldn't you wave the parking fees| just to keep us happy? His answer ‚ÄúI'm giving you a deal| the room I'm giving you now has bay view| and usually this room is more expensive| you should consider yourself lucky‚Äù ‚ÄúLUCKY‚Äù really?? We were not looking for a room with a view that at the end it was at the corner and the great view he mentioned was to the street and you had to go out of the room to the balcon to see the bay| they though they were doing me a favor| just because we were tired| we stayed otherwise we would cancel and go to a different more costumer oriented place| I dont recommend this place| at least until they fix their problem with the employees attitude.,0
Very nice hotel with nice view. Complimentary breakfast was great with a great variety of hot and cold food. Made to cook omelettes were great. Evening happy hour is awesome. Great drinks| great bartenders| good healthy snacks to accompany. Nice heated pool for this winter weather which the kids really enjoyed. Air conditioner not really working| as it is already controlled for the whole hotel. Room did get a bit warm at times| only option was to open sliding door. A little hesitant to do so with small kids| and on the 9th floor. Mattress on sofa couch needs to get updated. Seemed old| uncomfortable| could feel the coils at time. Other than that| front staff was friendly and polite. I like that there was plenty of room to sit for breakfast and happy hour. Lobby is spacious and clean.,1
Great place. Not far away from all the attractions.,1
First day we found ants,1
We loved the close proximity to the airport| the morning breakfast was amazing| the short drive to San Francisco and the fact we could sleep with our balcony door open in the evenings. The rooms stay rather warm (we like it colder to sleep). If you like to sleep with a box fan on for the noise the bathroom exhaust fan works perfect. The pillows are kind of crappy (no firmness at all). The only major complaint we had was the amount of trash/room service dishes that litter the halls. The trash is set out from peoples rooms and it felt like we were constantly seeing it or staff would take forever to pick up the halls. Overall though it was a great hotel stay and we couldn't complain about anything.,1
Tranquil hotel by the sea embankment looking across the bay towards the SFO airport. Beautiful landscaping.,1
The staff lie to us and over charged us when we didn't want the service that was the worse experience my family and I have ever had in a hotel never again will we stay there never the service was so bad that we are going to file a complaint on the hotel staff.,0
Location was convenient.  Hotel was nice.  ..............................,1
Clean and good breakfast. Swimming pool small jacuzzi extra small for the hotel.,1
Beautiful hotel| but rooms are a bit outdated. However| everything else outweighed this negative. We will definitely come back. Loved the complimentary happy hour drinks/snacks!!! Will and have recommended to family and friends. Staffs are great! Prices are reasonable and rooms are huge! Definitely worth every penny.,1
Loved the location and the view from the room was awesome,1
Nice hotel close the bay area| good scenic view from tbe rooms. N8ce and clean room with great breakfast. Evenning free snack and alcoholic beverages is amazing treat.,1
The Embassy Suites is right next to the bay| providing a lovely view and access to a walking/running trail just off the property.    The breakfast area has too many series of steps and ramps to access different serving areas.   This is problematic if you have mobility challenges.,1
GOOD HOTEL FOR FAMILY TIME.  PERFECT PLACE| CLEAN| GOOD SERVICE AND NICE VIEW.,1
We love the location and enjoy the view of the airport and the bay. The room was spacious and no adjoining door which was wonderful. The fact that there were so many children there was a problem as they liked to play on the walkways outside the rooms. We also had to request room heaters because the temperature could not be controlled from within the room and it was too chilly.,1
There is nothing to around the hotel for eating or even a small shop to buy water. Front desk is so rude and after my check out next day they deduct 10 USD from my credit card and I don't know why,0
happy hour| breakfast included| late check out| who could ask for more,1
Great views and breakfast! Hotel is huge! Rooms are spacious and great for families!,1
Convenient. Spacious for family of five and nice breakfast,1
This is our second time staying here| 2 years apart. Has been good both times. I love the breakfast spread and the staff is very friendly. We arrives before 10am and they sent us straight up to a prepared room ($50 for early checkin-worth it with small jetlagged children). Comfy bed and a pull out couch| cribs available (just put a blanket in the bottom since a bit hard-all good then). We have an evening flight and they even pushed back our checkout time to accomodate our tired kiddos. I love the staff here as they always have a smile. Its a great place for kids too due to the fish ponds and swimming pool. Would gladly use this spot again when transiting in SFO.,1
From my perspective everything was good,1
Loved the waterfront view and the lagoon - great to go for walks!  The breakfast was very good; however it was a little cumbersome to go to one station for your toast - then another for your eggs - one ir the other would get cold.  But overall| a very nice stay.,1
Apparently there was a wedding going on so no sleep for me! All night banging of loud music and people screaming and kids running in the halls with no parents supervision. Called the front desk all that I was told is it was being taken care of and that I could call tomorrow and speak to a manager! So basically so what if everyone else who paid a pretty penny for a beautiful room that you THOUGHT you were going to be able to get rest before an early morning flight... Very disappointed!,0
The guest room is too warm (in winter)| although the hallway is OK.   The guests can't adjust the temperature in the room.   You can open the patio door to cool down| but you don't want to leave the door open at night| so the room got too warm again during the night.,1
Nice people | food not that great | heather centrally controled | 65 degrees max | good location | quick access to highway | expensive reastaurant| extra room service charge | delivery charge |  plus 20 % tip included |,1
It had a good breakfast. And was clean. And staff was nice.,1
We reserved a premium room for two nights at this location.  our room was not cleaned.  we came to our room at around 10 pm and notified the front desk and they were apologetic and they will make a note of the incident. We requested towels for our party of four | 2 adults & 2 kids.  Since no towels were delivered after 45 minutes after my initial call we called again.  Front desk said they will send the towels right away but the towels never arrived that night.  Next morning my wife asked one of the maids and we got our towels but nothing else.  At the time of departure front desk denied that they had any notes from previous night and cleaning service said we must have left the Do Not Disturb sign on the door which is an absolute lie.  We travel a lot all around the world and we know better.  Front desk was not apologetic and did not offer any compensation for their mistake.  Steve the front desk supevisor was very apathetic and not helpful at all.  We will not stay at this hotel again and we travel to Bay Area quite often.,0
Hotel needs updating. Carpet looks very worn and dirty in hallways and rooms.,1
Pretty standard Embassy Suites. Breakfast was too crowded| hotel needs to open up a meeting room for extra seats. Had to eat breakfast in room because of no seating available.  $29 for parking is too high for area. Hotel redone recently| in pretty good shape.,1
Best hotel experience so far and I book in California often. Breathtaking location and beautiful holiday decor in the common area. Free wide variety breakfast included. Indoor heated swimming pool and jacuzzi. Friendly staff and affordable.,1
Staff was friendly.  Food was good.  Location. Is breath taking. Overall both thumbs up!,1
Great atmosphere| clean| delicious brakfastThe room has a great view| spacious,1
Beautiful property| wonderful breakfast and happy hour. Clean room| great customer service.,1
Nice room with water front view| excellent free buffet breakfast. Efficient shuttle to airport and BART train into San Francisco.,1
Great breakfast with very friendly staff. Pool area is smaller than other locations. Our couch hide-a-bed mattress was clean but very thin and needed an update. Looking over the bay is worth every penny.,1
Love the hotel| and the staff was great.  The only thing I wish was that the mattress in my room was more comfortable.,1
Free breakfast and daily happy hours.Huge place!  They provide free shuttle services to downtown areas.,1
It's the place I stay everytime I'm going to S.F.,1
Big room with good layout| good breakfast| restaurant food is mediocre.,1
Happy hour and morning breakfasts were great. The 20 minute shuttles to the airport were very convenient. Also had free snacks and soda were great also. Staff very nice.,1
We enjoyed are stay and loved the hotel and the area it located at! the view was amazing!!!,1
Very nice hotel and very convenient beautiful by the ocean,1
Comfortable| spacious room in nice setting.  Plenty of convenient room amenities| including safe| refrigerator| and microwave.,1
Lovely! Very clean|  fantastic breakfast.  But if a rip off having to pay to park your car at 29 bucks a night.  We got the att 11pm and left at 8am the next morning.  Fantastic hotel though,1
Fabulous accommodation and the breakfast was amazing!!,1
Mu plane arrive early| and my room was ready and they let me check in.  Everyone was very friendly!  Excellent!,1
No negatives only it would have been better if crockery and cutlery had been available in our suite| managed to get same in eating area though when we needed,1
The waterfront trail was awesome. Getting into the city was easy,1
We liked the amenities and the free breakfasts and social hour.  Also the view and location were great.  The fact that they have a shuttle to and from airport was also helpful| as well as to downtown Burlingame.  Overall hotel was great - great gift store as well.,1
It was a really great weekend The entire staff was always attentive always helping out and making our stay just as we were all family  Thank You guys very much The staff was just awesome and treated us with respect and with great smiles This hotel is always clean and quiet at nights My family and I will definitely visit this Embassy Suites Keep up the great job!!!!,1
Very good breakfast. Clean| spacious room. Only complaint is we only got 3 bath towels & we had 4 people. Was easy enough to just ask housekeeping for 1 more though,1
Nice| clean hotel relatively close to airport & freeway. Most Uber/Lyft rides to downtown SF were a little over $30 from this location. Embassy Suites breakfast & happy hours are always good. You'll want to bring in a case of water or fill up your water bottle when they serve food.,1
Clean place to stay with friendly staff. They were so helpful and kind they even upgraded our room without charge,1
Nice hotel| great outlook and good sized rooms| indoor pool and spa was great for the kids,1
Great location| wonderful facilities. The staff were very accommodating.,1
Nice location to either San Francisco or south bay area. The swimming pool facility and breakfast buffet were great.,1
Upon check in rooms we originally reserved king beds we not available. We found a set of sheets stained with blood all the hotel offered was to return our parking fee. Which I've yet to see that reimbursement on our credit card. Kitchen staff was very nice but e every time they'd  approached our table to clean they would take the plates with food we were still eating off table.  Breakfast area was already closed so we could replace the items we were still eating.,0
The air did not work when we got here.  The floor was wet in front of the fridge.  They put a $50 deposit on my card but never said anything about it.  The elevators were far from the entrance so it was really far for my 91 year old father.  The toilet seat cover was dirty.,0
The hotel was having some work done on the roof and the lift the workers were using was extremely loud and started at 7:30 am and went all morning. When checking out there was nobody here and had to wait about 7 minutes for someone to come and check me out.  When I asked the front desk what was going on with all of the noise they acted as if they didn't know what I was talking about.  Front desk was very rude and for that reason| I will likely never stay at the Embassy Suites again.,0
"My room and entire building's A/C was non funtional. Room was hot. Gave me fan for for $240 room rental. Unacceptable! Then front desk person denied the system was broken. He said the system was in the ""neutral""",0
The hotel is unique old hotel with character but well maintained. The location by the waterfront is superb..it's heaven for plane spotter like us.  The only thing the hotel should consider is change the TVs. They are old tvs probably 10 years old. We loved the breakfast and afternoon drink complimentary. We really enjoyed it.,1
Nice location| great views and the rooms are huge! The staff was friendly and they even let us check in early. Breakfast is included and they had plenty of options. Wonderful experience!,1
We love this property and are excited to stay again when we have the chance.,1
Very convenient to the airport and BART.  Good service by staff.,1
Checkin process could improve. Slow checkin and then they gave me wrong room type. I had to go stand in line a second time to get it right. Property is great,1
My husband and I enjoyed our one night stay in this hotel. The room is spacious and clean| although the decor is looking a bit tired. The comfortable bed alllowed us to have a good night's sleep| which was much needed after a 10 hours flight from the UK. Breakfast was good| I enjoyed the made to order vegetarian omelette| which was very fresh and tasty. The location of the hotel by the waterfront and next to a small lake is fabulous. On the morning before we checked out| we went for a long walk around the lake and by the waterfront| taking in the beautiful scenery. We would have loved to stay longer| would certainly return in the future and would definitely recommend this hotel.,1
Great breakfast| clean | friendly staff| comfortable|,1
Worst pillows ever had and really upset about have to pay extra $29 each night for parking on same hotel building without any previous notice until I check in and if I don't like the situation to cancel my reservation have to pay cancel fee| also needs attention for more variation of food and more staff helping plus more table w chairs,1
The stay was amazing!,1
I love it | view waterfront bay and quietly perfect,1
It was great üëç,1
Great location. super convenient to stay if you don't have a car. the hotel shuttle will take you from and to airport.,1
Beautiful view and great location| close to restaurants and freeway.  Breakfast buffet is awesome and gives you a good start to your day.,1
Polite staff| clean room but would like to have been nearer to the city,1
Great location for airport and golf at The Olympic Club.,1
Overall nice place to stay. Would stay again. Mattress a bit hard.,1
Overall the hotel is good but I don't like to pay the expensive parking fee there. Actually| the parking seems like open to public n don't understand why the hotel charges their customers.,1
Nice hotel | high standard. Lovely location| breakfast was great,1
Hotel was nice. Breakfast buffet was good. Double beds are small and tough for two adults. Charging $29 per night for parking is absurd.,1
Nice property for an overnight stay before a flight out of SFO.  The shuttle makes two stops before prior to stopping at Embassy Suites so we were turned away the first time because the shuttle was full.  We made the next shuttle| but others could not get one because the shuttle was full.  Make sure you plan plenty of time to make your flight.,1
The hotel was perfect for my family and I. It was right next to the water| had a great tavern| had good breakfast and was minutes away from the Golden Gate Bridge. We would definitely stay here again.,1
Nice o in pp nice location near the bay everything is good convenient to the airport,1
Made reservations through Expedia. Families| arrived at the hotel| and my client had to pay from his own account because the staff there| could not find his itenerary. Staff figured it out later and reversed the charges back onto his account.,0
Nice hotel near the airport with a beautiful waterfront view. The staff is friendly| rooms are clean and comfortable| and complimentary breakfast is way more than the average continental breakfast!!! Will stay here anytime!!! Thank you for a wonderful experience.,1
Loved the breakfast and free happy hour complimentaries. This hotel holds up the Hilton name and needs to live up to it. I stayed Thursday night-Sunday morning with another adult and three children. Although I complained on Friday night about the a/c not working in my room and the tub water not going down properly to the pleasant lady at the front counter it seemed like she made notes of it and that was going to be taken care of it. A few minutes later we received one fan. Sorry but one fan for five people wasn't going to cut it. We were too busy on this trip to stop at the counter to complain again but at the end of this trip I mentioned to the front clerk at check out how disappointed I was with the room. The clerk just said I'll make a note of it. Again I have a long ride home and didn't have time to argue or speak to a manager but I at least wanted some discount or at least an apology. I'm disappointed.,1
One of the nicest hotels I ever stayed in. Each room was a 2 room suite with two TVs. Free Quality breakfast in the hotel atrium they also offered a free afternoon snack and drink every afternoon. The Hotel sits right on San Francisco Bay overlooking the bay and airport in a distance. The Atrium is beautiful and the service was great. There is also a jogging/walkway trail along the bay.,1
My stay was amazing!! It is a very nice place| the view from the balcony is amazing. Very clean and service is nice and friendly! The hotel's location is very good. Overall the it is a very nice place to stay| very recommend!!,1
Great breakfast| but way too crowded. Couldn't find a seat.,1
It's was my 60th birthday and we had a great time thank you Justin and the staff also,1
It is the best hotel for my trips in the U.S.  Reasonable price| good location for Airport| fantastic view for the ocean| clean| kind| good breakfast and so on. I will stay again in this hotel.,1
Great hotel.  Just beware of the $30 a night parking. Seems like another way to bleed your customers out of another dollar. Make your parking affordable.,1
The door of the room is very loud. It should be replaced or repaired because it is so long.,1
Nice hotel for rest| very close to the sea| has free airport shuttle| but far from downtown| a little bit noisy..,1
Staff are quite helpful. Room was a little bit smelling.,1
Nice hotell in nice area. Good breakfast. Close to SFO. Friendly staff. Clean,1
Beautiful pool area on the 5th floor and warm cookies at checkin. Great location| easy walk to shopping and dining in the downtown area.,1
Family loved the pool.,1
Pretty good,1
The customer service when you check it was excellent also when you check out it was very nice all around the people work at Starbucks even the housekeeping it was nice I would definitely go there again I give it  10,1
The room had no microwave. We had food leftovers that went to waist. Chicago cost for food was to expensive not to be able to eat what we had left.,1
Our family of four stayed for 3 nights. My husband is in a wheelchair and the hotel was accessible. We did not request an accessible room so his only struggle was the bathroom| or fault| not the hotels. The chair lift and elevator to the roof top pool were in working order. It should be noted that handicap parking was on the 5th floor of the garage. We enjoyed how convenient it was to get to everything using our car as parking was unlimited ins and outs.,1
Really enjoyed the pool and the comfort of the room. It was a little noisy at night but that is because of the bachelorette party across the hall from us so can't be helped too much by the hotel. Overall great stay| great location,1
DoubleTree staff was very professional and friendly. Starbucks coffee in the lobby was convenient every morning. Rooftop pool area was exceptional for Chicago. Rooms were comfortable and adequate. Only negative were very slow elevators| but it was an extremely crowded weekend with guests| Bears game| White Sox/Yankees| art exhibits in town. Convenient to everything in downtown Chicago and Navy pier. Great place to stay! Yolk and D4 Irish Pub are a couple minutes away| along with other great places to eat.,1
Excellent location| convenient to shops and attractions. Very friendly doormen. Very friendly employees at the bar and Starbucks. Cleaning person was very friendly. Front desk staff not as friendly as i would of expected. Not rude| but i expected a happier more engaging demeanor especially since they are your frontline staff.,1
Great location and overall clean and comfortable. There were some stains on our bath vanity that weren't cleaned the entire time we were there but otherwise we thought it was clean. The downside was there were never clean towels out at the pool and there was a wait for elevators from 8am to 8pm without fail.  It would be nice to have drink and snack service by the pool. Next time I would stay on a low floor due to the elevator issue.,1
Rooms were clean and hotel well kept. Staff was helpful in getting us acquainted with Chicago and pool was nice. Service was slow for getting extra towels and there was never towels available at the pool. It would be nice to have a breakfast included for the price we paid.,1
We had dirty towels in our bathroom upon arrival.  Also the sink in our bathroom was clogged or not draining properly.  The staff quickly fixed both problems.  Overall good stay.  Did not like the limited elevators for such a large building.  Also the pool was crowded| maybe an adult only swim time and a hot tub would be good additions.,1
I loved how convenient the location is. We were able to walk to the arcade| navy pier and much more my kids age 5 & 10 years old loved it very much. Only thing I disliked was how long the elevators took and also I was told to wait until Sunday to check if I could pay for a late checkout. Sunday at 4am I asked the man working in the lobby if I could do a late check out and he said I had to wait until Sunday for check out and I said but it is Sunday and he said ut wasn't until 10am? Lol ok buddy!!! Other than that everything was great! Also couldn't get a late checkout if you were wondering.,1
Nothing remarkable at all. Our room was beat up. Broken curtain pulls| loose laminate. Bathroom had zero counter space. Room had only one towel. We requested more| but never got any. Should have been much better for the price.,0
Located near but not in the press of traffic - a block east of Michigan Avenue - the hotel is very comfortable in both the room and lobby area. We did not use the pool| but a number of guests| especially those with children made good use of it. There is a grocery immediately next door to the hotel and a number of restaurants in easy walking distance.,1
Very good location,1
Great area and great staff,1
I booked for four and pull out bed did have sheets| only two towels.  I stopped by the front desk and asked for more but never got them.,0
From checking in to check out staff was friendly and very helpful. The hotel is a bit dated but no terrible| room was spacious and view was great.,1
It was walking distance to Navy Pier and the Yolk| which was a good breakfast.,1
It looks like this hotel was updated. Our room was very nice| lobby area nice and pool was good. It seemed they were always out of pool towels| but periodically someone would replenish. Overall happy with the location and amenities.,1
Liked the outside pool!,1
They were short staffed. Our room wasn't ready on time. We asked for extra towels and pillows ...3 hours later and nothing. However they were ver apologetic about their staffing shortages when its not their fault but the staffing market. Hotel itself was clean| staff polite| and nice location.,1
s no kid friendly and overprioced starbucks.   it would have beden helpful to have more information,1
We had A nice and comfortable stay. The best hotel i've been to.,1
We loved staying here| staff was friendly and helpful. super comfortable beds| hotel was clean. We were able to walk to a lot of places and felt safe. Would definitely stay here again when we return to Chicago !,1
Pool too small and pool area/ bathrooms old and not kept clean. Many issues upon checking in but most were resolvedOverbook hotel with people who are there for the special hotel tour deal.,0
The staff was kind and helpful.  It was a very convenient location.,1
Great location. We've stayed there before and we will be back in the future. Clean| fun pool. No complaints.,1
The service was good the rooms were clean I felt comfortable. Great location walking distance to  the pier we have no complaints we will definitely come back .,1
I'll be right back,1
No one told me i had  to pay 59 dollars to park in the garage then when i called to speak with someone twice i got hung up on very disappointed this was a trip for my daughters graduation,0
I do like the lobby service| especially the guy name gustavo|he is very helpful person|,1
Overall experience was great| however parking was expensive and room wasn't completely stocked with supplies for a guests stay.,1
Very expensive parking and hotel price,1
Very clean and friendly staff! Pool was great| I loved the safety of the access to other floors! And we loved the complimentary cookies!,1
Location and amenities,1
Great location| great service| great pool.,1
Excellent pool area| close to so many sites| great places to eat| visit| and shop.,1
The price of parking in their garage was disappointing.  I saw online that you could do it cheaper if your car stayed put.  When I asked the front desk I was told no.  Be smarter than me and park across the street from the hotel.  It is two cross walks and then you are there!  It isn't covered| so that is the only bad thing.  Google parking in Chicago for cheaper options than $59 a night.  That is really my only complaint with the hotel.,1
Great place to stay.The air conditioner in my room was loud| so had to turn it off.You get free cookies at the front desk.,1
We really enjoyed our stay.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The location is only a couple blocks from Michigan Avenue and within walking distance of food and many attractions.  Access to the El is also only a few blocks away.  Would definitely stay here again.,1
Very clean room.,1
We loved the pool and the fun area with bags and a pool table.  The Starbucks downstairs was fast and all the staff was very friendly and helpful.  We will be back!,1
I liked the hotel but the first day our room only had 2 towels and wash clothes.  We had 3 in the room and no hand towels.  I requested additional towels 5 times and was told they would deliver| but they never did.  Thank goodness I could talk to a housekeeper the next morning and she placed clean towels in our room.,1
Low pressure in shower| standing water in shower due to poor drainage. 1 bath towel| 1 hand towel| no face cloth. Slow delivery of towed to room.,1
The hotel has a nice pool and entertainment area. I did not like that there was no hand soap and hand towels in the bathroom.,1
Check in was pathetic especially being at the children's hospital down the street. We had enough drama and stress in our life. Check in was dramatic and the people wheir snobby and very rude. They said we used hotels.com so booking with them we would have had better service. They kept referring me as the wrong name. I also had to spell my name multiple times and they still couldn't find it. I ended up unleashing the wild stressed out wife loose on them. We wheir almost a HR late checking in.,0
Great location with pool.  Very busy over the weekend with families so it made the elevators slow and pool unusable.,1
The only thing I was bummed about was the towel situation at the pool. We stayed three nights and there were never towels by the pool.,1
Clean property  and professional experience and execution,1
Everything was perfect!  The location was ideal for a family for parks| Navy Pier and shopping.  The staff went out of their way to locate and mail my child's blanket that was left behind!!!  I will always stay here!,1
The pull out sofa bed was so terrible. Flimsy spring mattress that kind of hurt to sleep in. I found something really gross behind the tv stand when unplugging my phone charger. I told to front desk when checking out| she was taken aback| understandable. The hotel overall is a great location| the pool area is lovely| game area is as well. Thank you|,1
Elevator service was pretty poor| not sure if some of the elevators were down for repairs but it took a while each time waiting on the elevators.,1
Great location| excellent customer service| cool pool outside and well kept| updated lobby and room.,1
Great hotel for stay in Downtown Chicago. Grocery stores| restaurants are available within walking distance.,1
Our room was beautiful! We had my two stepsons with us| neither of whom has travelled much| and neither had been to Chicago before. Everything from check-in (yay free cookies!) to our comfy bed and huge windows was fantastic. We stayed in a corner room with a king bed and a pull-out sofa| and when I called to get linens for the pull-out bed| I didn't catch her name| but the woman who brought the sheets helped me put the sheets on the bed and even ran back to get a different mattress cover when the first one was a little dirty. She made us feel warm and welcomed and it was a lovely experience!,1
I stayed at DoubleTree for two nights and pay $150 for deposits| during checkout| they said the deposits will be sent back to my card within 3-5 days| however| two weeks have passed| I received nothing. When I called their front desk and accounting number| they never pick up| after leaving a voice message| they never called back,0
The pool area and outdoor  space on the 5th floor was amazing.,1
The overall hotel was good but Housekeeping really was terrible!!! I ask to get my room cleaned everyday and no one ever showed up the 4 days we were there| we actually checked out early due to the house keeping issues‚Ä¶ No towels were available| the room was never cleaned| the lobby bathrooms had puck| pee and woman's period all over them‚Ä¶ I had 4 rooms (family members) and they received a moldy| gross pillows for their chicks ten to sleep and were told that's all they had‚Ä¶. It was so gross and the HOUSEKEEPING at this hotel is very terrible and nonexistent!!!!!! They need a new housekeeping director to get it in check‚Ä¶,0
Not up to Hilton standard.,0
Beautiful hotel with great staff and anAmazing pool!,1
They let me check in early. The hotel was very clean. Public transport is convenient. The warm cookies were great. I stayed five nights and will stay again. It's such a wonderful hotel. I love it.,1
Our stay was amazing.  All of the employees we had contact with were courteous and helpful.  I've stayed here many times and will continue to do so in the future.,1
Loved the staff| the bar and pool are beautiful. Rooms are VERY clean and the beds are comfy.,1
Rooftop pool and Location was great.  Will stay here again.,1
There was no hand soap in the room| which is very nasty anytime but especially during covid. I had to ask for a tv remote twice before I got it.,0
Free breakfast,1
The Staff at DoubleTree Hilton were friendly and helped to all our needs. The bedding was okay but need to be updated with full memory foam for better comfort.  Also| We were disappointed that there wasn't any access to the television for our own video accessories through HDMI ports for my son to watch Amazon or Netflix. So many hotels have this feature and we thought that would have been a great perk since we were not interested in any of the available broadcast DoubleTree Hilton provided. Love the cookies!,1
It's clean with nice presentation.,1
Perfect location and super quiet at night!,1
Hotel was great| had a very nice time.,1
No room service as advertised. Pool was nice and family friendly. Room was just ok| but overall pleased.,1
On word: cockroaches. Stay literally anywhere else. I stayed for two nights over the 4th of July weekend| and while the first night was okay| I came back to my room the second night and saw a cockroach crawling up my headboard. I immediately packed my stuff and checked out of the room. The overnight front desk person was nice and offered another room| but I knew I wouldn't sleep. I ended up sleeping on a friend's couch| and thank goodness I had local friends!!! That was the most major issue| but there were minor issues as well. First| there were no tongs with the ice pail| and despite calling and asking for some and being told some tongs were on the way| we never did get tongs. Okay| no big deal| I thought. I booked this place for the rooftop pool| and the pool itself is a lot of fun. Unfortunately| there are no rules about music| so multiple people were blasting competing| terrible music| and it definitely affected the vibe. We went out to the pool at around 1PM| and there were no towels. We asked for towels| and the staff person told us that the person who washes towels wouldn't be in until 3PM. They did come back to the pool with about eight towels| but we only managed to get one to share for four people. When I called to get a refund for the second night| the person I spoke to was argumentative| impatient| and unhelpful. I had to call three times because she hung up after answering one question each time. I have to wait 3-5 business days to see if the refund| so we'll see,0
AC didn't work the fan in the bathroom didn't work. There was no concierge there was puke on the elevator no breakfast available even though the website. Would never stay there again,0
I liked the pool on the roof,1
Friendly staff| clean and reasonable prize,1
Had early check in and room wasn't ready. White guy with a nose piercing didn't help at all. I ordered 2  rooms and requested they be next or across from each other.. My husband and I took my daughter out for her 14 birthday so her and her friend can have their own room| However since I didn't put ‚ÄúKids‚Äù on the reservation they put our rooms on separate floors and refused/ said they had NO rooms available on either floor.. Just a big inconvenience seems like he was to busy trying to be a big shot to actually help. Beautiful hotel| Rude and weird staff,0
Had a nice stay over the Holiday weekend. The rooms| lobby and elevators are well kept. Staff is very friendly and kind. The pool was a little underwhelming and the addition of covid restrictions and the holiday crowd didn't make it better - as well as the coffee and food area in the lobby. Would consider staying again but I would also be curious in trying other options in the area for the price point though.,1
the staff was honestly so amazing. at all hours,1
Everything was perfect! The kindness of all the employees| the cleaning| the service| I would stay again!,1
This hotel was PERFECT. It was the ideal location with a beautiful pool in the middle of the city! The staff went above and beyond to ensure my daughter and I had a great stay! We will for sure stay here every time we come back to Chicago!,1
This is a really nice hotel in a great location. Staff was friendly| beds were comfy| pool was warm- the only thing I wish were different is that I wish you could sit outside on the rooftop deck at night. I'm sure someone at some point ruined it for everyone else but it's beautiful out there (we were out for a few minutes at dusk before it closed at 9). Otherwise| great stay| we'd stay here again!,1
Since we got to the hotel| we have some issues.The bathroom was dirty the bathtub had some hairs on it,0
Wonderful place to stay! Everything was clean and the staff was outstanding! We will be going back!,1
Nice hotel in a good location,1
Ask the front desk for free cookies! Left our bags there on two occasions (before and after checkin/out) and baggage handlers were really nice and did a great job. Front desk staff also real pleasant and professional. Only thing was a loud rumbling sound at night| went on and off‚Ä¶ air conditioning unit on a neighboring building maybe? Couldn't figure out what it was‚Ä¶kept my wife from sleeping (on the Ohio St side).,1
Nice stay on nice property! Would stay again. It's on a one-way street and was not as easy to flag a cab.,1
Beautifully renovated | comfortable| spacious room ( we stayed at a suite with separate bedroom and seating area)| very nice shower. Better than expected!,1
Great location. The pool area was fabulous.,1
Staff super friendly loved the welcoming with warm cookies.,1
My wife and I love the pool area! It was very spacious comfortable seating but unfortunately there were never enough towels. Lots of kids were in the pool. But it is summertime,1
We had a great stay. Kids really enjoyed the pool. The rooms and service was excellent,1
The service was very poor.  The check inn terrible and didn't want to provide cleaning in the room.  We asked for the manager| who never responded.  I will not recommend this hotel.,0
Loved this hotel! Amazing location| close to Mag Mile| Navy Pier| Riverwalk| Millennial Park. Had a cool pool area and outdoor recreation space| just wish it were open past 9pm.,1
very clean. great location to walk to lake and to navy pier. nice little grocery store just a few doors down the street. starbucks in lobby which is convenient but expensive for a family but was a nice treat.,1
Great location !,1
Location was great!,1
Very clean & i liked that i received texts periodically from hotel staff. Good customer service. The only thing i didn't like is that the entire outside patio where the pool is closed at 9pm. I really wanted to sit outside under the patio lights & chill or play pool. I would definitely stay again.,1
Bar and restaurant were closed.  Some noisy guests particularly on the weekend around the pool.,1
Great location.  Super close to so many things to do.  Easy walk to Navy Pier| the beach| and lakefront trails.  Really enjoyed the outdoor pool on the terrace.  Very good value for the price.  Would definitely stay here again!,1
We enjoyed our stay-the Hotel staff was excellent! We enjoyed the pool| rooms were clean and the hotel is located in a great spot!,1
Our experience was absolutely perfect!  The staff and accommodations were extraordinary. Couldn't have asked for a more convenient| comfortable or pleasant vacay.,1
Property was clean| staff was nice. A/C was on high when arrived once we turned it off we can smell that the sheets or bed smelled like mildew.,0
Nice stay for a reasonable price| and located close to plenty of things to see and do!,1
My first time in Chicago with my husband for a relaxing weekend so I wanted a place to stay close to the Pier & Magnificent Mile so I found this hotel in the Gold Coast area. Shopping & the pier were close walking distance| just step out the front door and head to the left for the pier & to the right for shopping. I was impressed by the rooftop pool| very clean & the lawn chairs & umbrellas were of impeccable quality. The pool looks like it does in the photos & the view is incredible. I believe this might be the only hotel with an outdoor pool| so that was a plus. There is a Whole Foods across the street & a convenience store next door if you need anything. I liked that in order to use the elevator in the hotel| you need a room key - which was important because I felt safe. Highly recommend this hotel & will stay here again.,1
Front desk staff was incredibly polite and friendly. Pool area was kept clean and room was nice,1
Had a very good experience. Good location,1
Very clean. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Centrally located.  Walking distance to both the Lake and the river.,1
One of the worst experience I have had at a Hilton. Our room was on clean 1 day. We did not get new towels after asking 4 times. When I spoke with the agent checking out the only thing he had to say was he offered me a bottle of water. I will not be staying here again,0
The location was great. The room was very clean. I like the city view room.,1
I like how close it was to everything in walking distance. Didn't like that we were using toilet paper that was from previous person who stayed. Didn't like how it took me forever to get a roll of toilet paper when I needed to go tot he bathroom. Our coffee area in the room wasn't  restocked. Cups were missing and half the cream and sugar were gone. We were denied water bottles because we booked with Expedia instead of Hilton. I got a better deal that way so that's the route I took.,0
Overall Great stay| staff was fantastic and friendly| the restaurant food was amazing| right in the middle of everything| everything was great!,1
This was my previrthday celebration and my family and i enjoyed our stay in this hotel. By far one favorite hotel downtown. Its location is perfect to the activities we wanted to do. Plenty of restaurants to choose from and there is grocery store next door!,1
Great location older hotel we knew that. If you're looking for a quiet night not this place.  Besides guest being loud the street noise was busy with apparatuses with sirens.,1
No hassles whatsoever and warm cookies upon checking in!,1
I like that I could text the hotel during my stay| to let them know if I needed anything.,1
Beautiful hotel and perfect location,1
Very clean| safe and close to everything.,1
The Room was not quite ready even though I arrived 30 minutes after scheduled check-in.,1
Called SPECIFICALLY to be sure the pool was OPEN and was told YES | I even asked due to COVID-19. Upon arrival | pool was closed . Couldn't even enjoy the outdoor seating . Could of went anywhere for the price | hence confirming over phone . Was trying to relax for the first vacation in a couple years for a fail.A/C didn't work | and after five hours and the temp not dropping | FINALLY was moved to a new room . Okay sweet. New room has a bathtub with a giant puddle of chemical on floor which resulted in extremely slippery shower for entire stay| and with little ones ‚Ä¶ not so safe . THEN| topping off at check out for breakfast and get grapes with a mold all over the top layer. Parking garage elevator is extremely slow and run down .,0
This doubletree was not only exceptionally clean| it is the perfect location. Close proximity to all of the hot spots we wanted to visit. Will definitely stay again!,1
First time in Chicago and we loved staying at the DoubleTree! 10/10 would recommend.,1
I thought the parking could be cheaper,1
Great space| easy access to everything you need.,1
Everything was very neat and clean.  Our room was very quiet and comfortable also.All the people were extremely helpful and went out of their way to take care of us.,1
The bathroom was not as clean as it should have been the bath tub was dirty and i cleaned it out myself which wasn't a problem and the toliet flooded as well so i was not to happy about that at all,1
Awesome hotel! Right in between Mag Mile & Navy Pier! Perfect walking distance to everything! Clean and safe! Pool wasn't open| but it wasn't warm enough anyway. We had a wonderful stay!,1
The facility was clean. Jerome from house keeping was great.,1
The room wasn't regularly cleaned,0
Easy check in. Parking available in front of hotel with attached parking garage. Lobby bar shut down due to covid but plenty of restaurants and shopping within blocks. Rooms were excellent- very clean and all needs met.,1
I was traveling 8 months pregnant and all the staff stood and watched as I struggled with my 3 suitcases. Also someone tried to access my room during the night.,0
Amazing hotel! Great location. If you a person that hate noise from outside| don't stay there| why because there is a hospital near by the hotel and you going to hear the ambulance 24/7 lol| but beside that| great hotel and very clean! We really enjoy our stay in Chicago!,1
Overall| we enjoyed our stay.  However| training at employee on a Sunday morning during the peak of check-out probably not a wise idea. We also neverreceived coffee in our room the second day of our stay.,1
Clean facilities|  staff was great.  Beds were hard and wish there was an inside pool or hot tub instead of outside,1
Perfect place to get away for the weekend,1
We did our annual birthday celebration for my grandson and granddaughter and enjoyed the hotel in spite of what's going on in the world and the hotel was very nice except for the public bathroom that was next to the bar area it could use some tlc but otherwise a great hotel and location,1
Great venue. The cookies were great.  The bathroom was clean and updated.,1
This property and its staff never disappoint and we come back every February.,1
Convenient location| pleasant room but check in was condusing and air conditioning unit noisy in the room I stayed in.,1
Great location! We loved everything about this hotel| all in all great stay. We cannot wait to be back :),1
Great property with helpful staff!  Excellent location.,1
Customer service they also store my bags till evening which was very helpful because i checkout at 12 and i was in city till evening,1
Beautifully upgraded property! My only issue was the fact that I couldn't purchase a soda after 10pm... There are no vending machines at all.,1
Perfect part of town that we could access the rest of the city quite easily.,1
I loved my stay here. Staff was professional and friendly and the room was clean and comfortable. I love staying at DoubleTree hotels when I'm near one and this was no exception. My only feedback for improvement would be that self-park in the hotel garage is priced over 3x the rate charged by similar garages on the same block. I opted to reserve parking at one of those garages.,1
Very clean andcin the heart of downtown.can walk anywhere.,1
Everything in this hotel was clean and the staff were all very nice.,1
Nice| clean hotel right near restaurants| bars and shopping. Easy check in with a parking ramp attached,1
There was a cockroach in our bathroom!! Absolutely disgusting,0
Nice hotel for a fair price in downtown Chicago. clean and comfortable with a friendly staff.,1
Good location.  Able to check in early.   Very helpful concierge.,1
Great location! Starbucks . Restaurants nearby along with park and magnificent mile will stay here from now on,1
We were supposed to have maid service daily but only got towels. The hotel was very nice other than that and the cookies were a special touch.,1
Great location. Really enjoyed the warm cookies at check in!,1
"Surprisingly enjoyable stay for what I thought was just a ""value"" hotel. Friendly staff| good gym amenities| very conveniently located.",1
The whole staff was great to work with and knowledge of the City.,1
Had to wait for a supervisor to ‚Äúcheck over‚Äù our room..didn't get into our room for over an hour past check in time. Waiting in the lobby with 3 kids for over 45 min was not ideal. Aside from that| great experience.,1
Great check in| Alex was so helpful! We got the connected rooms we needed and parking all combined. Fabulous location| ability to walk to all our activities during our stay In Chicago.,1
Great Hotel. Great location. Nice rooms with great bathrooms. Great beds & great views.Every1 polite and helpful. Breakfast is delicious!,1
Front desk people and staff are very bad at there service they charge for my stay and I already paid up front at check out no invoice so they could charge what ever they want be ware.,0
Nice place to stay. Handy to restaurants and the MM. Good  gym.,1
Everything about the property was excellent.  Staff was excellent too.  I simply wish I could have had early check in as requested.,1
Great location| quiet| friendly and helpful doorman (Big Ben).,1
This is a good location| and convenient to the shopping district| Navy Pier| and local restaurants.Always clean; staff is always good to us,1
Great location near shopping bars and restaurants. The lobby ba closes ii early.,1
Location and parking.Big Bens welcoming and helpful lines!,1
The bed the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever had! Was actually able to have such a deep and refreshing sleep. Shower pressure could've been a little stronger or atleast have the showerhead option. Staff was very helpful and lobby interior was gorgeous,1
Very happy and very clean. Centered perfectly in Chicago,1
Had a great time| awesome location,1
Didnt stay the night due to a family emergency and they wouldn't refund my stay.,0
Overall it was good. Couldn't check in till 3. Tried 3 times to check in . Nope 3 pm .,1
Really nice stay! Perfect location. Suite was exactly what we wanted for our weekend stay.,1
The rooms are clean however the property itself needs an upgrade,1
Amazing place to stay.  Will def go back.,1
Great stay beautiful rooms with city view! Friendly staff,1
Double Tree Magnificent Mike had a wonderful| friendly staff! They were prompt to bring more towels when needed| and were always friendly and professional in every interaction. The hotel is in a wonderful location- we were able to walk everywhere from this central location!,1
Constant issues with the parking garage gate. Was even harassed by security and threatened to have photos taken of our license plate due to the key card nor gates working. Checking in was delayed| but they did upgrade us. The discount was not taken into consideration so my card was over charged and waiting on my refund currently.,0
The location was great.  Room size was perfect.  Staff was friendly and helpful,1
Im going to assume that due to late arrival we were given the last room which literally felt like a small box. When we booked and prepaid city view was noted. No city view| view of a parking garage instead. Room handles were dusty and toilet was slow to flush.The worse part was insulation was horrible. You had to keep the heater at 75¬∞ plus all night because once it was off our noses were so cold. We were in Chicago at 45¬∞ weather but didnt expect that. All in all if im sure we probably got the bad end of the stick but for my next stay in Chicago ill search for a diff hotel. Good parts were local to main shopping area and food and staff was very nice.,1
This property is just blocks away from the magnificent mile and the pier so the location is fabulous if you want to stay somewhere and not rent a car.  This is an older property but the staff and comfort of the rooms make up for any of it.  The staff is incredibly kind and very willing to help out in any way possible.,1
Great staff| clean| great bed| convenient location. Will stay there again definuteky,1
DJ| the door guy| was awesome!   He was super helpful at the front door| helping us with our luggage and to our room.,1
Excellent location| spacious lobby| private driveway entrance| and very courteous and helpful staff. Coffee shop in lobby was convenient. Room was clean & comfortable.  And affordable room rates.,1
views were impeccable from the 21st floor. was delighted to get a cookie at check in,1
Check in was extremely easy and quick and we were given warm cookies.,1
This hotel has recently undergone a complete renovation and it shows. Everything was clean and very good condition. The shower was amazing and the bed was amazing.,1
There are no vending machines or convenience stores within the hotel| but there are tons of options for food and shops walking distance to this property.,1
Convenient and accommodating,1
Very good hotel| excellent location in downtown Chicago.,1
Concierge was extremely helpful and staff friendly and professional.,1
Clean| beautiful rooms. Friendly helpful staff. Great location downtown. The only negatives are no free breakfast and if you park with the hotel it's an extra 55 dollars a day.,1
Nice and neat| staff was very friendly and helpful walking distance from navy pier which was awesome. As i was seeing a concert there,1
First-rate hotel in the heart of downtown Chicago.  Reasonably priced considering its location| with convenient self-parking.  As a bonus| there's even a Starbucks in the lobby.  Our one disappointment (the reason we did not give it the highest rating) was the restaurant.  It seemed like an afterthought to the bar| and while the service was excellent| the menu had a very limited range of options.  If you stay here| check out other dining options within walking distance.,1
Great location| clean| and accommodating.  Booked it again for next month,1
Check-in was a breeze| hotel appeared clean and well maintained| room was nice and beds were super comfy!,1
The hotel look terrible| old and dirty. And made the reservation trough Trivago-Expedia and I can not change the date or cancel. Never again use this application.,0
Everything was absolutely perfect. I've never been to a more welcoming hotel . By far this one tops any other. Staff was friendly as can be with an excellent attitude. The only thing I didn't like was that we couldn't stay longer.,1
This hotel was great. This was my 1st time staying @ that Doubletree & I will return.,1
Would definitely recommend this place to stay in Chicago,1
Good cookies very close to navy pier lots of restaurants near by,1
The location is ideal for going to theaters and the Parks.,1
Location of place| friendly staff| parking access were most valued thing..,1
Bell staff very helpful. Cookies. Comfortable bef and great location,1
From the greeting staff to when we checked out was extremely HORRIBLE,0
Big Ben was amazing| he helped with so much more than he had to.,1
I could not make my trip due to death in my family| but was charged and when I called the hotel to try and resolve the issue the were rude and not helpful at all,0
Breakfast included will be nice. It was a very nice stay,1
The housekeeping service was a little slow| by the sound of it| they seemed to be short staff and overwhelmed. They should get more housekeeping staff and retain them.,1
Everything in the room was nice and new and clean. Checking out was quick and easy and the staff member was helpful. Checking in was fine but while waiting in the line (it was about 4pm and understandably very busy) I noticed that the staff at the desk was allowing some other guests to jump the line| which was very frustrating.,1
Chocolate chip cookies| all staff were super friendly.,1
Room was not ready when I arrived (after 4pm). Bar closed earlier than advertised each night. Pool was bigger than most| and in a nice setting. Neighbor noise a bit high. Comfortable bed. Good location.,0
Everything was great. One main reason we chose this hotel was because of its pool. It is an outdoor pool with a nice seating area around it| but it is not heated. This was the coldest pool I have ever been in. We were looking forward to using it| but could not because of the temperature. The outside air temp was around 80 everyday| yet the pool was freezing. I have never been in an outdoor pool that was not heated.,1
It was clean| comfortable| and well-located. No problems.,1
A great place to stay and be central to everything| everyone we met was friendly and helpful from the. Concierge to the super smiling Starbucks Guy,1
Location was nice and staff was very charming. But to pay for parking and internet was ridiculous and way over priced.,0
Awesome location | the staff was outstanding| could use some updates especially to pool area.,1
Perfectly located for exploring all the downtown attractions| most within walking distance. Rooms are clean and the service was excellent. I highly recommend this hotel.,1
I liked the location of Double Tree!  There are so many restaurants and things to do within walking distance.  I wouldn't mind booking it again but most likely only in the off season.,1
Stayed here before| always clean| close to everything| pool deck and bar outside is great.,1
WiFi was difficult to stay connected.,1
Everything about the hotel was amazing! Every staff member we encountered was helpful and friendly.  The hotel was close to everything.  The room was clean and comfortable. Will stay here again next time!,1
Staff was excellent. Property was very pretty. We enjoyed our stay.,1
Check in was supposed to be at 3:00. They told us it would be half an hour| when we checked back after half hour they said another half hour| so we checked back after an hour.  They still weren't ready.  When we told concierge it had already been an hour| she was very rude.  Didn't get us in our room until 4:30. Plus elevators weren't working properly.  So there were long wait times for elevators.,0
very close to beautiful beach| and to navy pier. staff is very helpful and friendly,1
They made me wait to check in and the sheets werent clean.,0
Our stay was the last getting away of the summer before the start of school. . The hotel staff were great. The room was okay. It's an older hotel that has been renovated. My boys loved it. Only issue was at the pool on our last night. Some young adult girls were at the pool and wereloud. They were playing music from their phone and personal speaker music with illicit lyrics. No one said anything because the girls had obviously been drinking . There families with small children and couples| etc nearly 25 people outside of them present. Security came at the end when the pool to close the pool. Last| older building have older elevators. The elevators were slower and caused tremendous lines. Now those cars need modernizing...again.,1
Loved the location - walking distance from sites and restaurants,1
Very nice value in an expensive part of Chicago. Good location and very friendly| helpful staff. No complaints!,1
Nice hotel just could have be cleaned a lot more thoroughly.,1
There seem to be water leaks throughout the building.,1
Great pool with very nice view. Great location: just around the corner from the magnificent mile.,1
Amazing property. Loved the lobby|pool and accessible parking,1
The location was perfect| central to everything happening in Chicago,1
1. we booked the property well in advance but was told there's no room for us when we arrived. I understand it's a late arrival situation (1AM) but they could have tried to contact me first (they have my phone and email) to see if I'm still coming. It seems like an oversold situation and my arriving late just means no room for me.2. we were sent to this alternative hotel a block away at 2AM in the morning. It's close but the condition is nowhere near Hilton standard.3. they promised us earliest check-in possible the next day (the staff mentioned 11AM or similar)| but I didn't get a room until almost 3PM. I repeatedly ask the front desk staff to call me or message me directly when the room is ready| but they never did| and I have to manually check with front desk again at 2:30pm to realize that my room is ready4. the room I got had construction noise going on for hours (can't work or rest or anything). Took me 3 or 4 phone calls to eventually switch us to a different room.Overall a terrible experience| mostly service-wise. The room itself was mostly great and clean.,0
NEVER STAYING AT A #DOUBLETREE by #Hilton ever again!! The price is definitely not worth the hassle ‚Äî Stayed at the Chicago DoubleTree Miracle Mile (or whatever it's called)| and again| will not be staying at one of these ever again| and not sure about Hilton either| even though I am a #HiltonHonors member due to frequent travel from work before I went back to grad school... - Payed for an upgrade to ‚ÄúDeluxe King bed with City View‚Äù| but my city view was just the facade of an office building smacked up against my window- Room was not ready at check-in time- Tv service/system is horrible| and keeps losing signal/resetting every 20 minutes- Printer at the business center ran out of ink and they apparently couldn't be bothered to send someone down the street to buy a refill| which was a huge inconvenience since I was in town for work and definitely needed a hotel with a competent staff/working business center where I could print needed documents| so I had to resort to looking up a UPS store that could help- The pool apparently was closed for hotel patrons... people actually paying for their stay here... for some event they rented it out for... and I was not told this when I previously called the front desk to confirm internet prices before booking my stay... this is something I should definitely have been told about!,0
Great location| nice hotel and modern clean rooms.,1
I've stayed here many times before. For the most part it's been an easy speedy checkin process and frnt desk staff had been helpful in the past. NOT this time| I arrived after a long flight only to find out they're over booked & have to relocate me to another hotel. When I asked why I hadn't been informed prior to my arrival I was told it's just not a priority to do that. Even though I wasn't staying there the staff was far from welcoming and seemed annoyed. It just wasn't pleasant vibe at all. Disappointing| this was one of my go to places when visiting Chicago,0
On arrival to the Doubletree my family and so arrived before check in time. We were told that our room was being cleaned and they would put a rush on it. Two hours later| even after the 3pm check in time| we were still sitting in the lobby. On arrival to the rooms one was very hot. There were no towels in any of the rooms. The housekeeper was in the hallway so we asked for towels. Her response| ‚Äúcall the front counter I don't have any towels‚Äù| even though she had a cart full of towels. After calling it took over an hour to receive our towels. The next day| after exploring we came in ready to shower to prepare for dinner and again there were no towels in the room. So hot and sweaty we waited another hour before we were able to get some fresh towels. One of the cabinets in the bathroom was broken but since they were very slow respond we didn't even waste our time reporting it. For the amount of money spent| there was no microwave available for guest use and the room where we thought the ice machine was located was full of supplies like they were doing construction. The staff was very nonchalant like the satisfaction of their guests didn't make a difference. The only bright smile| was the head bellman.,0
Great trip| good hotel. The bar staff at the lobby are some of the best in Chicago :),1
Love the outdoor pool! It was perfect on a sweltering day!,1
Staff was very personable.  Was unable to check in a little early or check out a little later even though I had to wait past check in time bc room wasn't ready.  Room service not available before 3 or at pool.,1
In for a short getaway with my family from Iowa and nice hotel and we loved how close it was to everything and nice warm outdoor pool.   Very nice employees!,1
We had no issues with our stay at the DoubleTree.  We enjoyed the pool on the roof and liked the fact that they served Starbucks in the lobby.  The staff was incredibly helpful and polite and our room was very clean.,1
The location is good. The staffs are nice. The parking is expensive so use App to find better place to park. I stayed in 3rd floor so there was noise from the road during night. The bathroom has no fan to circulate hot air.,1
The hotel was great the staff was underwhelming and attentive and long lines to check in check out with only one person behind the desk seem more interested in selling trips and getting people checked in and checked out of the hotel,1
The room was spacious| clean| and great view of the pool and city.  There could have been more lounge chairs at the pool and tables with umbrellas.,1
Close to shopping and the lake. Very loud if your room is on Ohio but it was 4th of July so there was a lot of people downtown.,1
Love the location.  Stores nearby.  Shopping for all yours needs very easy.  Access to private and public transportation very easy.  Walking distance to navy pier| and downtown attractions.,1
Location. Outdoor pool was great!! Friendly staff and clean hotel!!!,1
Just all-around Pleasant stay,1
Pool was amazing for the family.  Kids had a blast.  Great location and service was excellent.  We are planning to stay here again in the future!,1
Well located; friendly helpful staff. Clean riooms and nice restaurant.,1
I have stayed at this location several times and enjoy each time. I will return.,1
Only complaint is the fact you don't get a discounted rated for parking even though you are saying at the hotel.,1
The lobby was lovely with a lot of seating. The pool area was very nice.,1
Very comfortable Convenient locationWould stay here again,1
The free cookies were delicious and the staff were all very friendly and helpful with any questions,1
This was a pretty nice place. Close to the pier and a lot of cool stuff by the river. The only issue I have is with the toilet of all things. It flushed very weakly and it was prone to clogging. Had to have maintenance come and plunge it once. Other than that| it was the nicest hotel bathroom I've ever seen...,1
No microwaves and overcharge for room service. Other then that| everything was great!,1
Location was brilliant and hotel was good too. the staff were pleasant and courteous| Big Ben was the best..,1
Perfect location.  A short walk to Navy Pier and shopping!  Great food close by!,1
Great location| clean| and comfortable beds!  Everything was wonderful!,1
Comfortable bed! Love the cookies. Everyone was so so so friendly and helpful.,1
The property is close to Navy Pier and all the shopping we wanted to do.  The staff is always so friendly and helpful!  The rooms are clean and comfortable.,1
Very friendly staff| very clean Hotel| never wanted for anything,1
Construction started at 7:30am and sounded like a jack hammer right next to our room. We were un aware of this prior to check-in.,0
Everything was great!! Great location staff was very helpful,1
Location was great.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Cost of room for no additional amenities such as pool or work out facility was high.  I would have thought that parking would have been included in cost.,1
The friendliness and cleanliness of both the people and the businesses.,1
Very clean and modern. Staff was super friendly. Only complaint was the traffic noise.,1
Nice place| in a good location.really nice stay| quiet all good thanks,1
Property did not have a microwave to warm up food. Air in room would not work past a certain temperature. Was held up in parking garage because of angry people.,0
It was amazing I had a great time no complaints whatsoever would definitely recommend and stay there again.,1
The property was very clean. However| the front desk guy Alex was extremely rude. He did not greet me| had me standing there for 5-7 minutes while he was typing on the computer. He never offered me any cookies. He was just really rude. But I did speak with the manager Lili the next morning and she was Awesome and accommodated my parking.,1
Great location| for a tourist!  Staff great| housekeeping was great! Room was perfect!,1
Loved the location easy access to restaurants and shopping . Corner room didn't have a full panoramic view but still and decent view.,1
The Rooms are beautiful and clean. The welcome cookies are so good i do plan on bookin a room again in the future.,1
The rooms need a remodel. Loft remodel is very nice.Noisy neighbors (two separate family's with young kids) We were travelling as a couple.,1
The location and amenities are great; we've stayed here in the past so we wanted to enjoy this location again.,1
Very nice property!  We didn't have any issues with anything!  We always stay here when in Chicago.,1
Good value for money. For location in downtown Chicago| good room size.,1
The hotel rated at a 4 stars but the room condition and furniture is out dated less comparable to a 2 stars hotel. Would never come back again.,0
Good. Thank you. Always improvement possible.  Staff is corteous,1
i didn't like that our room was between a noisy ice machine and the elevators which were noisy all night because they were constantly being used. There were also just thin sheets and blankets with no other extra blankets in the room| we weren't able to access the wifi at all on any of our devices without paying $9.95 per night which we weren't going to pay since we only brought a certain amount of money which we lost right away when we had to pay a $75 dollar deposit even after we spent almost $200 booking the room and an additional $55 just to park for the night which was absolutely ridiculously overpriced. Needless to say we are never staying here ever again and we had a horrible time here.,0
Nothing to complain about at all. Provided shuttle service too.,1
The location and staff were fantastic.  The bathroom did not have enough space to put things including the towels.,1
Easy parking. Great location to downtown. Friendly Staff.,1
The hotel is at a great location and within walkable distance to the magnificent mile| millennium park and navy pier. The staff was very nice| and overall the hotel had a very pleasing  atmosphere. The hotel room was clean and spacious. The only thing that bothered me was that there was no fan or vent in the bathroom. The huminnity after showering had caused the moisture to build up and you could tell there were spots on the ceiling that looked questionable. Not sure why you wouldn't but an air system into a hotel bathroom.,1
Very clean and rooms are updated great service at the bar i hated paying so much for parking that was the only bad thing so if you going to stay here i suggest using public transportation or ride share,1
It was really closed to Michigan Ave. and Navy Pier,1
Parking bothered me!!! Why the hotel dont have parking discounts? How can you have rent a room and still have to pay for parking there?,0
The person checking us in was trying to tell us they didn't have our room because we booked through Expedia.  Then he told us we could down grade to queen beds free of charge or pay an up charge to get a different room.,0
Close to my daughter's residence.  Close to restaurants.,1
Heating was not right   it was cold conditions and maintenance had to come,0
The view I like but the deposit and parking prices daily are ridiculous,1
Everything was excellent !!! Great location!!! Nice rooms !!!,1
Great location in downtown Chicago. This made a lot of things readily available.,1
Great hotel with very friendly staff. Nice location by Magnificent mile shopping and many great restaurants.  Walking distance to most everything.,1
Rooms are great. Newly renovated. Beautiful finishes. Nice chocolate chip cookies and free water.,1
Clean and comfortable.  Expensive breakfast buffet.,1
Ms. Kimberly conveyed Awesome customer service! She gave a very warm welcome and I loved it! I didn't like under construction/renovations going on!,1
Room was clean| however I had requested a king room and received 2 queen beds. I checked in early and asked them to text me when room was available and they didn't. Also parking credit of $30 was not received. Was told I would get it on my receipt and we should just park in the garage. We did this and when we Checked out they said since we paid for the garage they can't give us the credit. She did give us $18 credit from restaurant.,0
Excellent location. Nice and friendly staff. The floor and room is clean. Beds are comfortable. Excellent buffet breakfast. Will stay again.,1
Well first my boyfriend make the reservation but he lost his I D  and he have to change the reservation under my name and take to long to get from Expedia to do the new reservation we try 3 times to check with them to see if they get the new information but they didn't and we decided to leave even that my boyfriend works on the Same industry business in Chicago we think the staff could be a little more helpful .so we lost our money for the reservation,0
Love the location!,1
Cookies were delicious. The price was great and the staff were very friendly!,1
I didn't like that we had to pay for the parking. The bathroom floor wasn't clean.,1
I enjoyed the modern vibe for business class  also the location is perfect,1
Staff were extremely polite and helpful. Felt like home being there. Internet was no good which is shocking given the location,1
just a note that the inside of the windows had ice on them in the morning.  it didn't affect our stay. staff was nice -rooms great - love the make up mirror in the bathroom!!!and the mattress was comfy,1
Have stayed here before and everything was as good as I remembered.  Clean comfortable rooms| pleasant staff at a great price.,1
Great!,1
Great experience- friendly staff| especially at the bar/restaurant. Was not given a cookie at the first check-up| slightly disappointed! I also wish there was an option for a constant fan mode on the thermostat. It went from loud to quiet all through the night.,1
The hotel is a short walk to Michigan Ave| restaurants and the food in the hotel was great.  The room was very clean and comfortable. Great experience. Can't wait to go back without the snow!,1
Great hotel. Patrick was super friendly and nice. Front desk could be more polite.,1
Great hotel and location. Would've been perfect if not for slow WiFi,1
Location of this hotel is great...walk to restaurants and shops easily. They are next to a grocery store where you can buy incidentals like water| soda| snacks even sandwiches and liquor.  Hotel is beautiful and staff are so nice| we enjoyed our stay.  We booked two rooms and were able to be next to each other which was nice of the hotel. I like the double queen room| very clean| nice big vanity in bathroom with shelves on the bottom for storage. View of city only problem the weather was real crappy and rainy.  The thing it does need is a coffee shop or something. Had to go across the street and down the block for quality coffee in the morning (missed breakfast). Hotel only has one restaurant/bar area which is on the first floor/ lobby area.   No coffee shop in hotel unfortunately but still liked it.  We went to Navy Pier (yes it was very very cold but it's New Years Eve) Navy Pier is about a 7 or 8 block walk east from hotel but it went by quickly. Once inside Navy pier you warm up quickly.,1
Love the cookies| comfortable bed| great location!,1
Construction noise at 7am. No recognition for gold status. Tired rooms. Beds aweful,0
Started out bad and my reservation was wrong. The staff was great at not only fixing it but upgraded. That is going over and above. Don't see that often. Would go back,1
Terrible and online full of lies will never stay again,0
$55/day parking when other similar location and price hotels (Marriott) charge zero.We will not be staying there again.,0
We came to the city to see the show at Chicago Shakespeare Theater on Dec. 26.  It coincided with a huge family Christmas event in the suburbs| so this was a perfect venue.  We were able to walk to all our destinations: the Mag Mile & Water Tower Place|  the restaurant and Navy Pier.  The reason the service was not marked excellent is because the bell man who brought the luggage upstairs told us he would give us a call to our room to tell where my son could buy a coke in the building.  He never called us back!,1
The check in process was one of the smoothest I've ever had.,1
staffs in the front desk were not friendly. Good location,1
Great location and friendly staff.  We enjoyed our stay.,1
We had a fabulous stay! The kids love the warm cookies we were welcomed with at check-in| and the gentleman at the desk offered to find us adjoining rooms which was so very kind.,1
Property was well maintained and front desk reps were very friendly and welcoming,1
The property was really nice. My one displeasure is they did not have any microwaves on the property at all.,1
Hotel was clean| modern and beautifully decorated for Christmas. Room was spacious and clean. Location was perfect right off the Mile! We didn't even notice the construction that was mentioned in other reviews going on in the common area (outside lobby).We will definitely be returning to the Double Tree for future visits to Chicago,1
We like the location and everything was fine.  The staff was really helpful in accommodating my requests.,1
We liked the convenience to the Miracle Mile and other parts of the city (museums| shopping| dining| etc). We especially liked the personal attention given us by our housekeeper - she provided us with personal touches like extra regular coffee and artificial sweetener and creamer after greeting us one morning. She was great!,1
It was amazing! We live only a few hours away from Chi-town so we consider it our second home and this was our first time staying here! We will definitely be back! I just wish parking wasn't half as much as the room!,1
We got to the hotel early| but decided to see if we could check in early. The receptionist said it was no problem| and in less than 5 minutes we were up to our room. We have stayed at this Doubletree in the past| and like it for being close to a lot of good restaurants| and shopping. We again were happy with the results. The weather| which was extremely cold| was the worst part of the trip.,1
Service was good.,1
Nice hotel very clean and good service. Good place near downtown.,1
It was such a great stay!! We both enjoyed. We'll be back!!!!,1
Good stay.  Hotel was under construction so lobby entrance had some discomfort but room was great.,1
Very pleasant,1
I stayed downtown at your hotel for the parade and your Hotel was clean and your people were very nice however I was quite disappointed with the fact there was no refrigerator in the room. I have a child that takes medication that requires refrigeration. I have stayed at Hotels that let's just say weren't up to your standards and they at least had refrigerators. I also wasn't told that I would have to pay more money towards incidentals. Again that's never happened to me before. I understand that 55.00 went towards parking however I couldn't leave the garage before I paid so why did I need to pay in advance. If anything was wrong with the room when I left you had my card already on file. I felt that was quite unnecessary. Again it's never happened to me before at any place I've stayed. I've stayed at better and at worst and never paid more than my original price that was quoted! Now I have a problem with Hotels.com which I plan on taking up with next. Don't think I'd stay again.,0
Hotel was nice| staff was very helpful.  No refrigerator in the rooms| and the shower pressure is god awful.  Couldn't even wash my hair because I knew I would be in there for an hour trying to rinse it all out.  Also WiFi is terribly slow and kicks you off every ten minutes or so.,1
We had an excellent stay. Conveniently located and very accessible. It is only a few minutes walk to the Magnificent Mile. We loved the staff there!,1
Hotel is currently being renovated.  No on-site restaurant or bar. In room coffee maker did not work and room service went straight to voice mail.  Had to go down to breakfast buffet and pay $3 for a cup of coffee to go.  Cleaning staff playing loud music in the hallway while cleaning inside rooms at 7AM.,0
Out room phone connection wire was shredded| so we had to head downstairs 22 floors to order room service (they're remodeling the entire hotel| so elevators were a challenge).Their wi-fi was out the entire time and I was trying to get work done after putting my daughter to bed.,0
Lovely hotel and you can't beat warm Doubletree cookies at check in!,1
Won't stay again.   Poor service| horrible horrible horrible elevators| lost power in our room twice|  unfriendly,0
Good location| clean. Staff not very friendly during check in.,1
Great central location. Nice friendly helpful staff.,1
Hotel looked like it was under renovation but it was still nice!,1
First the negatives: being next door to the elevators resulted in unwanted noise during the night.  The toilet and shower were less than robust.  Positives: great location| Holly at the front desk| comfortable room and bed.,1
There is loud construction going on and only two elevators were working so if you're on a high floor like I was| it takes forever to go up and down. Also| it's annoying when hotels don't have free WiFi. Should be a given these days!!!,1
Excellent location| friendly staff| beautiful rooms,1
Hotel was under renovation| almost no elevator service|dirty bathroom| rubbish in room.You did not tell me about the renovation| I would not have booked. I also could not find a telephone number so I could consult you as to what to do.,0
Everything with the Doubletree was good. Parking was $55 for less than 18 hours connected to the hotel. That was a bit extreme. No validation either.,1
Great hotel but in the middle of remodeling so gym was closed which was disappointing for my daughter but we would definitely stay there again.,1
Needs renovation. Seems significantly behind doubletree i amused to and behind hotels in chivago downtoepwn area. Amenjtjes are bad| room is likw a 2 star hotwl,0
Under construction with too few elevators and strikers banging drums to wake us up on the night of our first stay b,0
When we got there the hotel was under construction.  We were then notified that the hotel employees union was on strike| so no room service and rooms would only be cleaned every other day.  They then offered ear plugs| because the employees on strike would start beating a drum loudly beginning at 7am.  Despite all this we still paid full price.,0
Hotel was in the middle of a strike. Services was precarius and there was a employees manifestation in front of the hotel| making a unbelivable noise from 5am to the sunset. Hilton just made a letter of excuse. Unaceptable!,0
Location is good.,0
Double is centrally located to magnificent mile| navy| pier| cloud gate. You can walk just about anywhere from the hotel. The deposit fee was the least expensive in comparison to other hotels.,1
Perfect location. Close to Navy Pier & shopping. Clean| comfy hotel,1
Hotel workers on strike in front if hotel! No room service. No hot water for showers. Carpets dirty. Most spaces closed due to construction. Many amenities missing.,0
Good location. Some construction going on but otherwise clean and neat.,1
Terrible hotel. Staff were on strike and we were promised that it will not effect our stay. However| our room did not get cleaned once and all we could hear is the strike. Staff were rude.,0
The hotel staff was on strike the whole time we were there. The strike workers made noise early in the morning until late at night. We had to ask for towels since we did not get turndown service. The hotel was under construction so we were not able to take the elevator to the lobby of the hotel. We had to go to the ground level of the parking garage and walk down the ramp to go inside the hotel.,0
When we arrived we had no idea where to go to check in.  We were disappointed to find the whole front of the hotel was under construction and workers where on strike.  My husband had a hard time getting around.  We will never stay there again.  We come to Chicago every other month for my husband's treatment at Northwestern Hospital.,0
We had a terrible experience being at this hotel.This hotel is overpriced and has no complimentary breakfast.It does not have a lobby area where one can sit and wait for friends.There was constant noise  as the  hotel staff was on strike | this meant we could not sleep .When we complained the hotel said they couldnt do anything about it.The next day we had to clean the room and do our own beds as the hotel did not have staff to do so. Overally we had a moserable experience at an oberpriced hotel,0
The hotel room was nice.  The only issue we had was there was no counter space in the bathrooms to put anything! Small sink| one little skinny shelf that doesn't hold much| and the shower design makes water go all over the floor.,1
The hotel was under construction and the staff was on strike. None of this was forthcoming when making reservations or we would have picked somewhere else. We could hear everything from our room on the 18 floor. Staff working was not pleasant and inviting.,0
The customer service was good and the room very comfortable. This is the our second time at this hotel. The room rate was at a great discount| so since we were staying in Chicago for 5 days| we took this deal. I think the hotel is doing a good job trying to minimize  the inconvenience for customers due to the construction work at the hotel. My only compliant is due to construction the elevator from the parking garage does not go to the lobby floor of the hotel. This was very  inconvenient and was hard due to my husband has health problems walking. You have to walk from the first floor of the parking garage to the front of the parking garage entry and walk down a hill to the hotel entry. We stayed there 4 nights| so it would have been nice to have self-parking fees discounted for this inconvenience to customers. We had a very nice view of the city| but the windows were very dirty| but I assume it was due to the construction on the hotel.  We would stay again at this hotel once the construction phase is complete.,1
Lobby under contruction| access to lobby via garage elevators difficult with luggage & kids. Staff offered to assist with golf cart,1
No mention of construction at booking.  Super outdated hotel.  Old everything. Extremely overpriced for what it is.,0
The staff was very helpful and friendly. We had never been to Chicago before and the was very helpful with directions to different events.,1
Great location and friendly staff,1
The hotel was dirty and fairly unsafe. Very disappointed that this is a Hilton Hotel. Staff was rude and I was supposed to have parking included in my stay and they said they had no idea what I was talking about and charged $110 on my card for parking. I will never stay here again.,0
Close proximity to all attractions.Convenient to conference,1
It is an older hotel and it does need updating.  Rooms were fine but dining and bar were very dark and need updating. Same with pool area,1
Under construction so a little bummer great location,1
Pretty nice,1
It's a good spot for doing stuff downtown. Only about a 20 min walk to the Navy Pier and fairly close to several really good restaurants. Staff was super helpful| and when I wanted to eat but the hotel restaurant was closed| not only did the doormen have a really good alternative but I got 20% off my bill with a coupon they gave me. Easy to get a taxi and close to the train station.,1
Everything went well with our stay we we had no complaints,1
Nice hotel.  Convenient to Naby Pier| shopping and restaurants. I only wish that the room included a mini fridge,1
local position is perfectÔºå service is wonderful.facility is convenient.,1
Really nice hotel with great service. Didn't try the breakfast. Clean gym.,1
Everyone at the front desk were very nice. The only problem I had was housekeeping knocking and entering at 8:00am and again at 10:00am. It only happened on checkout day thank goodness but it was aggravating. They are also not serving breakfast. Which we were fine with we like our sleep lol,1
Everything was great except the gdfish left on the chair. Guess the desk chair wasnt cleaned.,1
It was good. I didn't like that we had to pay $66 dollars a day to park after paying $150 a night fore the motel room.,1
Great value for downtown hotel. Nothing super fancy but the rooms were clean and comfortable. Not having a free breakfast due to covid was the only bad thing about the place. The pool was nice.,1
Hotel was amazing but we park 3 blocks down off rush with parkchirp there scanner dont work so they try to charge you twice. But hotel was great customer service was great also location 5 star,1
I thoroughly enjoyed the flexibility they provided. Especially| Charles at the front desk was amazing. He got me an early check-in despite they were running full.,1
This may not be the fanciest hotel in Chicago| but it was perfect for a casual long weekend in the city.  They have EXCELLENT customer service| very clean and great location.,1
Very nice place,1
Rooms were clean and comfortable.   Staff was helpful and friendly.  Disappointed that coolers with pop and other essentials were lacking products.,1
Fantastic location.  Quiet area near a hospital.  Parking options were not great| close but expensive.  All elevators were never working so 15 minute waits most of the time.  Only one clerk even during busy times.,1
Great location.  Rarely did all three elevators work and waited up to 25 minutes.  Not enough front desk staff and manager just stood and watched. Parking is expensive.,1
A lot of racist out of state people very overwhelming,0
Room was amazing and the location was fantastic.  With a great ramen shop across the street| two great chicago pizza shops a block away| and water tower mall a skip hop and jump away| downtime was never an issue.Check in was slightly delayed| but with worker shortages post pandemic coupled with lots of late checkouts I'm nothing but sympathetic.As of July 2021 there is still no breakfast due to covid.  The pool and fitness center were operational however and very nice.,1
Loved the room set up! I liked knowing no one would come into my room during our stay.  Anything I needed replaced would be left at the door for me.   I wish the ‚Äúsnack bar‚Äù area had a better selection of drinks.,1
I've stayed there before and enjoyed it...,1
We loved that it was a half a block away from Northwestern and the lady at the desk was super super nice. Views from the room where beautiful.,1
Check-In was congested due to it being Friday evening & raining very hard. There was no carts to carry luggage on. So my husband & I had to carry our luggage and packages up to room| where we had to make several trips. Once in the room| cleanliness was good view was beautiful. However| bathroom was very small (we were on in unit 2401) When toilet flush| it had a loud sound. Shower also made loud sound when turning on water. Other than that| the stay was good.,1
Arrival was a nightmare! I reserved a king room at the beginning of May for the weekend after 4th of july and confirmed my reserfation a week before the booking. Despite all of this they had no rooms available in the specifications when i arrived. We were put into a temp room with a broken air conditioner (dissembled) and told that someone would be up to fix it soon after reporting it. After almost an hour I checked back in at the front desk and they said the person was on their way. After going back up i discovered they were moving us to another room...fine. or at least it was fine until we woke up the next morning to find small blood stains on the pillow| sheet and comforter on the bed. Heading tothe elevator to speak with the front again a family knformed us that they had a cockroach in their room the night before. So after missing the first night of a festival AND all the other disturbing happenings I have received no compensation for the chaos and can wholeheartedly say this was the worst travel experience I have ever had.,0
Floor sloped from entrance into the bathroom. Made me feel uncomfortable.,1
Very convenient to everything,1
I stay here often when I go to Chicago. It is always clean and friendly. The staff goes above and beyond to make sure everything is just right for your stay.,1
i didnt make this reservation but i was charged,0
It was a nice hotel| however there was no parking close by that wasn't 60/90$ a day. We also didn't know that if you pay with a debit or credit card| you pay $100 a day for a deposit. We were there for two nights & had to pay $200 extra dollars on top of our $400 hotel| for a deposit| that could take up to a month to refund to our card. rediculous.,0
We have stayed here almost every month or so when I come to town to see my doctors at Northwestern.  It always is clean| smells fresh| and no complaints from us.  The desk folk are very polite and helpful.  Walking distance to doctors offices| restaurants| and shopping make it the ideal location.  The views of the city are marvelous| especially at night.  We will be staying again in October and enjoying all this place has to offer.,1
Just around the corner from Lurie Children's Hospital and off Michigan Ave.  Clean and quiet area with the exception of ambulance sirens  but that is to be expected by a hospital.,1
This was the perfect weekend getaway. The staff is amazing and accommodating. Our room was perfect. We will be back when the rooftop pool is open!,1
Location was GREAT! Staff was AMAZING. The only thing that I disliked was the $66 fee per night to park your car. I did not know about this fee until I got to the hotel.,1
They need microwave in the rooms,1
Great customer service from the receptionist at check-in very helpful with where to order food late,1
Great clean hotel| check in was very fast. Elevators got busy at times. Walls are thin though I could hear the people across the hall in their room and it sounded like they were in the hall but they weren't. Other then that the sheets were extremely soft! Bed comfortable too! I would stay again in the future.,1
Great location for the price,1
There was no food service available. Elevator was slow durning check out times.,1
The only thing that was not good is there's no parking Ur staff was excellent!,1
Everyone & everything was great. Our stay couldn't have been better  The front desk personnel were exceptional by helping us navigate around town & finding places to eat. Will stay here again!,1
Overall our stay was great. We had a minor problem with our room that was corrected. The staff was extremely courteous and professional. If I go back it would be because of the service.,1
Room was very clean and the beds and pillows were so comfortable.,1
Very nice - close to everything!! Clean- beds comfortable! The valet parking I feel was a bit spendy but I didn't want to deal with driving around trying to find other parking after fighting traffic to get to hotel.,1
Friendly every time I go. Clean and quiet.,1
The hotel was great as was the service.  Lynette and,1
It was super close to the magnificent mile!!,1
Always happy to stay here. Quiet and clean. Staff is always friendly and helpful.,1
Lynnette was a little gem. A credit to the hotel.,1
Downtown beautiful view| but no free parking! I would go there again I parking 2 blocks away!,1
They should definitely specify that the $200 deposit that they're going to take out in addition to the actual payment of hotel will be taken out of your debit and or credit card not just your debit card. Other than that place was nice very busy but nice,1
I really liked the location just the room was a bit cold and it was small,1
Great location for NW hospital visits.  Most restaurants were delivery or pickup only due to Covid restrictions.,1
It was very nice especially being  on the 37th floor.  Convenient to hospital where I had an appointment.   Nice restaurants closeby.  Room large for my wheelchair.  Buildings around were very tall and litup pretty at night.,1
It's great hotel with perfect location so close to everything.,1
Hotel has really good soundproof walls| great location| and big spacious rooms. Staff is very nice and they allowed for a late checkout| which was great. The only reason I didn't give highest excellent rating is because the AC/heater Unit in the room was so loud we couldn't sleep. Maintenance came and fixed it| or at least tried| but the noise continued and the room actually stopped cooling down to the temperature we set it at. If it wasn't for that| I would say great stay and I would stay again.,1
Clean| nice city view. Pleasant staff. Perfectly placed in the city.,1
Affordable. Convenient location. Chose parking elsewhere to save money - but I do this with any hotel. The staff seemed to be wearing masks and I saw at least one staff member ask a patron to put a mask on when they didn't already. The room seemed very humid- I'm not sure if the air conditioner didn't work well| or it was just because it was a rainy day| but things seemed damp which wasn't great. We were also high enough up (30th floor) that we didn't really pick up any street noise from below which was good.,1
No breakfast parking or pool as promised! No housekeeping had to call up front for everything and they didn't offer ANYTHING for the inconvenience- won't stay here again,0
Perfect location everything downtown was walking distance staff was nice room was clean and big,1
Everything was very clean and easy and efficient,1
Everything was great except the room temperature was extremely hot for it to be 65 degrees. There was no way to adjust it lower.,1
You would believe by being associated with the Name ‚ÄúHampton‚Äù and being downtown that this place would be beautiful.  Well it isn't!  Upon arrival| our room which we first received was cracked open and the lights were left on and the deadbolt lock was missing.  Which is highly suspicious in Chicago.  The second room assigned had a toilet that wasn't properly working and the audacity of the staff to bring a plunger as if I work there.  This room was $125 and needless to say..... Don't waste your money.  The name doesn't precede itself.,0
We found a roach and had filthy towels in our room. Guest services did comp my room.,0
Would have liked to stay pre or past COVID19 but we needed a getaway. Hotel was awesome under the circumstances. We love this town.,1
Great location and very nice hotel for the price...,1
The view was great| and the room size was larger than expected.,1
Great location.   Clean Hotel  Appreciate them having a functional business center.When I arrived there was no record of my reservation| great follow up my front desk staff to resolve the issue with minimal inconvenience to be..  Great customer service during the pandemic.,1
The view the room had was amazing. And the set up of the room was very nice as well,1
I was told by 2 people they would hold my bags while I went to work at the hospital during COVID crisis. When the morning came| the front desk staff told me no. I was told i had to pay for another day to keep my bags there. I agreed. When I got back| all my stuff was out of my room. They were able to track it down about 30 min later.,0
In the first place i chose this hotel because of the Breakfast Buffet and also the location| Im calling the everyday before my flight here in Miami and they always saying everything's fine and they are still open. When I came in with my friends i didn't know that everything is shutdown they should told in me in the first place so I can book other hotel that is much cheaper because I paid for it ! theres no service at all not even room service. theres no housekeeping everyday. I know we have a virus situation right now but they should allow all the guest to order room service and then serve it with a togo containers.,0
The room was nice. I had to switch rooms after two attempts to enter into my original room (battery dead for key entry.),1
Amazing. The bedding was great and the service and breakfast was awesome,1
Nice clean room. Very close to the Magnificent Mile (half a block at the most). Big area for breakfast.,1
Everything was nice! The staff was very polite and friendly. The breakfast was fair| and the pool wasn't open| but otherwise i loved my stay here qnd will be coming back!,1
Location was perfect. Front desk staff was great.,1
It's too far from the riverI love visiting museums but they are too far from the property. It is also too far from the Millennium   Park,1
Our stay was great| the hotel was clean the staff was friendly and very helpful| the location is good| right in the middle of the Mag Mile and all kinds of restaurants| I will stay there again,1
The bed was so cozy and the service was so amazing,1
Our room was very clean and had a nice view of Michigan ave. The breakfast had a good selection.  The only thing we didn't like was that the bathroom ceiling paint was peeling off and needed to be fixed.,1
Very nice| clean and spacious room with a view!!! Close to eveything!!! Will book here again!!!,1
Great location! Super close to Ann and Robert Lurie's Children's Hospital.  Close to lots of restaurants and a candy store. Will definitely stay here again!,1
Spacious rooms for being in downtown Chicago. We were very comfortable here and it is a great location near shops and restaurants.,1
Very good Hotel for the price. Loved our room which was on the 38th floor. Breakfast was exceptional and beyond our expectations. Location was great| everything was within walking distance. Loved the staff and how friendly they were!,1
The hotel was very clean and conveniently located.  The view was beautiful as well as the room. Very  attentive staff and great valet service.,1
I read mixed reviews so I didn't know what to expect but it was a really pleasant experience.,1
Everything was made easy for 3 out of towners not familiar with the city. The hotel was clean| comfortable| friendly| and answers and accommodations were done in quick fashion to make us feel welcome and like our stay was important to them.,1
Friendly helpful staff| good breakfast| convenient location,1
Easy check in| check out. The rooms are in great condition.,1
Good maid service.  Brkfast offered to 10am. Friendly staff,1
Older hotel but great location 1/2 Bloch off the Magnificent Mile| very clean| service at front desk| lobby and breakfast was excellent.  Will stay there again when we return bto Chicago,1
1st room was noisy you could here elevator Traveling and water pipes hammering.2nd roomHeater was out and it was 12 degrees Fahrenheit Outside.,0
We will be returning. Amazing location: everything you could want from shopping| Lincoln Park Zoo to Ogilvie is within a 20-40 minute walk. Huge props to how quiet our room was| as well as how fair priced the night was for the large room we booked!,1
The cleanliness of the room.  The awesome staff that helped us every step of the way.,1
Great room| views of Michigan Ave and Lake Michigan.  Nicest staff ever. Only room for improvement was peeling paint on bathroom ceiling.  Thank you!,1
Such a nice hotel in a perfect area for shopping and food. Everything was walkable distance. Great customer service| will definitely stay again!!,1
great location and comfortable room.   Great price,1
The property was very clean and the staff was very helpful.  However there was a loud noise in the wall whenever the shower was turned on and at other times. (I believe it was when the shower was turned on in other rooms.),1
The elevators were inadequate The Bldg needs an upgrade. The mattress was lumpy The staff was pleasant.,0
It is clean and good hotel. The price of 3 night was very good. Also I like the location of the hotel. The only thing wasn't good is the parking $49 a day.,1
The breakfast was very good. The staff wasn't friendly at all.,1
Great location and good service!,1
Good location for Magnificent Mile with a close-by parking garage| in addition to a valet.,1
The room| breakfast and fitness center were all very nice. Our room was a tad bit noisy with street noise (mostly sirens several times through the night) and we were on the 32nd floor.  We had to wait a few extra minutes for the elevators during the breakfast and checkout rush.  All the staff I interacted with were very good| but we didn't need anything in the room (it was well done from the start).,1
The best thing about this property was it's location. The rooms are in need of a makeover| furniture very run down. My bathroom had a leaky toilet| someone was sent up to fix it but all they did was turn the water pressure down making it difficult to flush. There was annoying gnats flying in the bathroom| probably because of the toilet issue making it impossible to shower or do anything in the bathroom in peace!  After my rocky check in I really just wanted to go to another hotel| but the prices were really expensive. I've always heard rave reviews for the Hampton Inn| but my experience just wasn't that.üòî,0
nice complimentary breakfast in a spacious loungecomplimentary wifi with strong signal,1
Great location in the heart of the City right off Michigan Ave. Large rooms with decent views. Staff was very friendly. Excellent choice.,1
Will definitely stay at Hampton Inn on our next visit to downtown Chicago.,1
Great service| friendly staff and beautiful city view.,1
The heater was not working| the room was dirty| I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.,0
Loved the view from the 31st floor as the sunset over the city.,1
Pet friendly| breakfast was great. Loved that there was warm hot water and coffee available 24/7. The staff is amazing.,1
The front desk was great. They helped change reservations,1
Location is great and this humble three-star hotel competes marvelously with the surrounding four-star hotels. I stayed at a nearby four-star hotel nearby for the first leg of the trip because there was no rooms available at Hampton Inn so I can confidently say that this hotel does a much better job of making sure you feel like your money was well spent. Also there's coin laundry site- BYOP (bring your own pod) $2 per pod..lol.,1
Everything was very nice with the property. Only negatives I can say is one of the valets was a little rude| and I had to take a cold shower d/t no hot water at 8 at night. Otherwise great experience.,1
It was awesome!,1
Friendly staff| great location. Highly recommend.,1
Front Desk staff was very| very helpful.Room size very large.Need exhaust fan in bathroom.,1
Great place to stay in downtown Chicago.  Location is perfect| price is great| staff is excellent| room was wonderful| breakfast is excellent.,1
The hotel itself had a good central location to the city but The first night the air conditioning was not working. I couldn't sleep it was so hot! They finally came the second day after asking twice. The second day| there was no hot water so we had to take cold showers. Not good business- they should've offered us some sort of discount or something,0
Great location. Large room,1
great location and nice staff and breakfast was good.,1
Great location that was closing to lots of shopping and eating options. Breakfast buffet was awesome!,1
Stayed for 4 nights and the front desk staff was awesome especially Alejandro. Everyone always greeted us with a smile and asked if we needed anything. Breakfast was good and there was always plenty of food and the staff there were also great. When the elevators got congested during the breakfast hour the hotel staff took guests to other elevators to speed up the wait for the elevator. Our room was great along with our view. Great location. Would definitely stay here again!,1
My stay was excellent!,1
right in the heart of Chicago- great location for any kind of activities,1
Great breakfast and location.  Staff is also great,1
Great location and rooms are nice.  Check in is a pain.  Don't expect to check in before 3pmBreakfast is ok but other times have been better,1
Everything was absolutely wonderful.,1
Our room was ‚ÄúMagnificent‚Äù| spacious and very clean. The only change we would make is to the mattress of the sofa bed| one can feel the springs in ones back,1
Hotel is located in fantastic spot to everything downtown. Breakfast buffet was a bit of a zoo and elevators were hard to get a times (forced to use stairs from 28th floor on more than one occassion after waits of 15 minutes plus). But price and location made up for it.,1
Good location. In the heart of the shopping for Chicago. It is near northwestern hospital so much street noise...sirens etc,1
The good: breakfast was free!  The not so good: you could be waiting a while for the elevator.,1
The room was spacious and well appointed. Quality items and good WiFi service. The only negative was the wait for elevators but the staff were attentive to this and often stepped in with additional options.,1
Dedicated elevators for upper floors|  breakfast was l large,1
Very disappointed| the faucet in the bathroom dropped all night| not matter what you did| I couldn't get it to stop dripping. I had to put a towel in the sink so I didn't have to listen to it all night. Then in the morning I went to shower in the zero entry shower. The drian was plugged. Water was running all over the bathroom in minutes. Then 2 more people had to shower. Talk about a nightmare. Then to get ready to go in the pool of water. I did let the front desk know| they didnt seem concerned.,0
Pretty neat room design. $50 to park seemed a bit high,1
Everything was perfect. Thank you.  Great location.,1
The staff at this Hampton provide excellent customer service and they do so cheerfully and politely. They go out of their way to make sure your stay is a pleasant one.,1
Was very close to everything walking distance. Will stay here again,1
Great value for unbelievable service and a wonderful location,1
Staff were friendly and helpful.  Rooms were clean but a little dated.,1
The staff was amazing - they were prompt| accurate with their answers| and accommodating with questions and assistance.  The staff made the property !,1
Liked the hotel's central location.  Close to the magnificent mile shops and to the lake.  Lots of good restaurants in the area.,1
We had a awesome time. The breakfast was a amazing. The pool on the rooftop had my daughter's loving it.,1
Perfect location! Good deal for weekend with the Cicago Air and Water Show going on. Free breakfast was ok| but very crowded,1
Tried to check in early for the suite but was unable. At check in time 3pm was also told the suite was still not ready and would be another 20 minutes. Spoke to the manager who made it worth while on my bill for waiting the extra 20 minutes.the suite was gorgeous  and had an excellent view. Staff was very friendly  i would definitely go back to the Hampton Suites,1
Room was very clean and service was great! Have stayed at this particular hotel now twice as it is a perfect location to be near everything!  Have always loved the fact that Hampton Inn's wash even the duvet cover everytime!,1
The hotel is in a really good place| you have everything near of you.,1
My only complaint about this hotel is the time it takes you to get an elevator when coming down.  The 3 elevators are shared for two hotels.,1
The staff at the front for all venues in the building were so polite and helpful| and the gentlemen at the door on the street made every effort with transportation and safety of boarding cabs for us. Have stayed there before and hopefully will come back again.,1
Exceptionally friendly and helpful staff. Always gave awesome suggestions about sites and where to eat.,1
I liked the location of the hotel| the price and of course free breakfast.  The only thing I didn't like was the price for parking.  However| even with the parking cost it was still a great price for a hotel right around the corner from the Magnificent Mile.,1
It was great. The only downside was the rooftop pool was a waste| it's so tiny and full of kids splashing and running unsupervised| it was impossible to enjoy. Walkable to a number of attractions and also to the L train.,1
Nice room| courteous and helpful front desk staff| especially Alfredo. The parking folks lost my car key| Alfredo was helpful in fixing the problem.,1
Great location| really pleasant and clean rooms| but the thing that makes this such a good place to stay are the staff. All of the people are incredibly helpful and generous with their time and advice. This is our 2nd time to stay in this hotel within one years.,1
Great location! Staff very friendly. Rooms clean however needs updating such as fresh coat of paint and carpets need to be cleaned or replaced. Hotel parking is pricey. We used parking garage right next door which was $11 cheaper.,1
very good location| friendly and helpful staff but the elevators were extremly slow,1
The only thing is elevator rush time| really horrible you can wait for 15 minutes or more to get the elevator,1
Great Great location! Excellent services! Fast check in and out! They really made us happy! Yummy breakfast! Great view from the pool in 40th floor! Sure I will go there again| my daughter 4 years old love It! Special thanks for the hotel representative | she was in the lobby all the time and during the breakfast time she welcome us and making sure that we all happy!,1
Good location that's it not worth the money for a worn down dirty hotel . Could not wait to leave,0
The hotel is in a great location.Spacious clean rooms.Breakfast was convenient.Slow elevators were the only draw back specifically in the morning. A nice hotel and would recommend.,1
We had a great time and the hotel was so Centrally located to everything!,1
Very happy with our time here. Only negative was long wait for elevators| but understandably 40 floors to cover.,1
I love the location| being right off the main drag made everything very accessible| even with two young kids!  Breakfast was great!  No chance to explore other amenities.,1
The Hampton Inn was a nice| clean hotel. The location was great. The service was good and according to our 11 yr old the breakfast was the best. Would definitely recommend the Hampton Inn.,1
Liked: location| large gathering area| clean room| secure| 4-hour window for breakfast| coffee in lobby.Did not like:  elevators are way too slow| chilled water in lobby would be nice.,1
I think the valet parking cost was too high. Other than that| the hotel is great and perfectly located.,1
Location was excellent. Price was very reasonable.  Breakfast was adequate. The main problem there were only 2 carts to use for getting out of the hotel.people would bring the carts to their room and keep them there for loooongggg periods of time. They either need more carts| or there must be a time restriction on how long people use the carts. I had medical solutions which were too heavy for my husband and I to carry so we were forced to leave them in the room.,1
Great location in downtown Chicago. Literally steps from Mag Mile. The bathroom was a bit cramped but otherwise the room was comfortable and clean. Nice staff and free breakfast too.,1
Great location| breakfast| pool area. Elevators take a looong time!,1
I liked the large room| the hospitality and the location. Staff was helpful regarding directions to attractions,1
Great hotel| at a great location in downtown Chicago.   Room was clean| staff attentive| and free breakfast!,1
A little bit noisy| bc it's very close to hospitals. Traffic is bad at rush hours.,1
We had a good stay. Hotel clean| breakfast was good. Went for an adult birthday & this hotel isn't conveniently located by many bars| we walked a while. Wasn't an issue but if you're going for similar reason & not planning on using Uber or a taxi service| you may want to find something a little closer.,1
Everything about my stay was nice.  Friendly and informative staff| very clean from the room to the breakfast area to the hallways and the lobby.,1
There is a nearby strike happening and this hotel not only doesn't warn guests checking in| but happily dumps you into a room near the strike- which starts up every day at 7 am with loud drums and banging and yelling| and goes into the early hours of the night- without warning or explanation. It took us 2 mornings to figure out what was even going on| desperate and sleepy| and when we finally spoke to the front desk we were offered ear plugs and no apology| nothing. Maybe the hotel is generally ok| but considering even through ear plugs| the fan running| and pillows over our heads we could not sleep| I would call to see if a labor agreement has been reached with that hotel before booking. It's been going on for close to a year| apparently| so it isn't as if they don't know those rooms are going to be awful to stay in. We certainly were charged full price without hesitation| however.,0
Room was clean and good sized.Front desk staff could have been friendlier.,1
Location was excellent| just steps from Michigan Ave. Easy to walk to lots of attractions. Rooms were clean and comfortable.,1
Awesome location - close proximity to Magnificent Mile & Northwestern.,1
Great place to stay if your looking to shop| eat and do a little sightseeing. Great breakfast buffet also,1
We went to Chicago for a vacation| and selected this hotel due to proximity to attractions and transit options. The staff were extremely courteous and helpful. They gladly checked our bags after check out. The breakfast is a lot better than many hotels| especially considering it is included. (The pour your own waffles are great). This hotel is located a short distance from a pedestrian tunnel to the lake shore| so I was able to take a morning run. It was a little cool out for the pool| but I recommend going up there anyway for a nice view. All in all I would recommend.,1
Great location| parking was the only issue. Hotel does not have any parking and parking deck next to hotel was $63 a day.,1
Staff was nice and always helpful to find a taxi. Rooms were clean. Had an issue with the air not working in one room| someone was sent up right away to fix it. Breakfast was great with assortment of options. The only bad experience we had was the long elevator wait times around checkout & checkin times.,1
The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was very clean and comfortable!,1
Prime location and excellent view from rooms. Fast check in and check out.,1
We loved staying at this hotel. Nice hotel room and nice view of the city. The staff was friendly. Would recommend!,1
Great location. Clean and tidy. Front desk staff not overly friendly but not rude.,1
Close to magnificent mile and Northwestern Hospitals is did hear ambulances at night,1
The Hotel is right in the middle of everything at Chicago. All I wanted to do or see was either walking distance or a short ride away. Chicago CTA Stop is merely 2 or 3 blocks away and easy to get to. Would stay there again.,1
The room was spacious| updated| and comfortable. The location within the city was perfect as well!,1
Pictures on rooms a lot different than they were really!,0
Great breakfast| clean room| really liked the walk-in shower| all staff were very polite.  Since our accessible room was on the 37th floor| we had a great view on the city!,1
Staff was efficient and friendly.  The room was very clean.  Very nice hotel.,1
Liked the location| close to everything. No shuttle service for airport pickup.,1
The customer service there is a joke. I was told my money was fake and we were out our two night stay that reserved way in advance !! I used my REAL money elsewhere and it was checked there as well and was REAL. I was treated like crap | and like I was a criminal or something.  Would not advise anyone to stay .,0
The only thing that was wierd was that my room with one bed was behind the elevators. Apparently all one bed rooms are behind the elevators.,1
Where do I even begin? This hotel was perfect for our family trip to Chicago for my bridal shower.  Close to all of the shops and restaurants - this location could not have been more perfect. We were greeted by the wonderful Lynette and Talisha who went above and beyond to make sure we were happy and comfortable. When Lynette found out that we were in town for my bridal shower| she surprised my family and I with some yummy treats and a delicious bottle of red wine - what a way to make a girl feel special! My family and I could not be happier with this hotel and the staff truly made our weekend all the more better! For my family who has never been to Chicago| the stay at the Hampton Inn left a lasting impression on them for the many years to come and we will definitely come back to stay at this hotel!!!,1
Tried to cancel Sunday night stay on Saturday ( the 3rd night of our stay) for a medical emergency. Was not allowed too and had to pay for a night that we were not there.,1
Hotel staff was accommodating| friendly| professional| and helpful.  Wonderful location - loved the view from the 35th floor!  Hilton was short walk from Navy Pier| Water Tower Place and Millennium Park. The complimentary breakfast was amazing; it included cheese omlets| sausages| French Toast| and wonderful sliced fresh fruits and of course| waffles| cereals| muffins| etc.  Coffee was great.   Room was clean and bed was very comfy.  We were very satisfied.  I would definitely return to another Hilton location.,1
Staff was very friendly| breakfast was great as well.,1
did not like the parking 63 dollars a night was crazy,1
"Good stay. Housekeeping was slow and did not respond when I had put up a ""do not disturb"" sign during a 3p teleconference| so I was interrupted during the meeting and then they did not clean the room during that day due to their timing. I was frustrated by that.",1
The data FC was friendly and the hotel and our room was clean. The location was perfect! Great place to stay!,1
Super friendly and helpful staff. I would stay here again| definitely.,1
We were close to shopping and restaurants. The staff were friendly and helpful. We had easy access to our vehicle. We would consider staying here again in the future when we come to Chicago.,1
right by miracle mile and lots of things to do!!!!,1
Only issue we had was the elevators in the morning.  We waited 10 mins for an elevator in the morning on the weekend,1
Clean hotel| ideal location| friendly staff. The only down fall it the elevators. If your an early bird plan to get up at 6am to beat the rush.,1
I found our room to be dirty... found food under the bed and curtains were stained / dirty looking (room 1909 )  staff friendly and helpful with directions.,0
Great location| huge room. There was some sort of water problem where we had a wet carpet area near the bathroom| but not a big deal. Good breakfast. Would definitely stay here again!,1
It was a spacious room and the breakfast was great| staff was very friendly and helpful.,1
Very helpful and attentive staff in the lobby!,1
Location is excellent.  It lacks in amenities that other big hotels have.,1
Only complaint was the terrible elevator traffic. We were on the 15th floor. We had to go up| just to get down. No other complaints. Friendly desk staff| clean and quiet rooms!,1
Large rooms great breakfast friendly staff good location,1
The property was in a great location| walking distance to almost everything.,0
One word: amazing staff! Especially Lynette; she's a treasure!,1
The location was perfect. The breakfast was good and the staff was really friendly/helpful. My only complaint is that the heating/cooling was very loud.,1
Perfect location| clean and comfortable| great breakfast too.,1
We enjoyed the complimentary breakfast - great variation and selection. Wonderful customer service.,1
Good bang for your buck with a yummy breakfast in the morning.,1
Excellent facility very friendly and helpful staff I would highly recommend this hotel,1
Great off season pricing| allowed for late check in and check out| courteous and helpful staff| decent breakfast buffet. Heating system seemed inadequate for Chicago winters though.,1
Rooftop exercise area with great views of the city and shore. Very spacious breakfast area. Room was clean and comfortable. Excellent location| next to Michigan Ave. Only complaint was the early 6AM noise from protesters outside an adjacent property| but that's out of Hampton's control.,1
There was a mistake by a 3rd party booking agency and the hotel charged us for their mistake. They were not reasonable about it at all and were rude even though I didn't do anything wrong they refused to refund me.,0
We were given a room for people with disabilities. It took me a while to figure out how the shower works.They should have given us a regular room.,1
Very clean| very large room| great service. Lynette was the best! I've changed my other Chicago reservations in the future to here just because Lynette was so awesome!,1
Love the free breakfast. Did not like Expedia listed parking at $60 a night but when we got there they told us it was $63 a night,1
The room was okay| nice location. Heat went out & had to have someone look at it three times. Finally got a portable heater which worked fine. Valet was not timely & congested in drop/pickup zone‚Ä¶improvements a must.,1
My stay was great. John at the service desk had amazing customer service. He greeted me with a smile and made sure that my stay was great and I was comfortable while dealing with a cold.,1
Perfect Chicago location! Within walking to everything!,1
The location of the hotel was perfect and close to all of the sites we wanted to see.,1
My stay was great. They were very helpful at the front desk and the breakfast was amazing. Nearby to a lot of restaurants. Can be a tad noisy at night but that comes with being in a city.,1
I love the free breakfast|the large rooms|the location|the restaurant inside the hotel(exquisite food)|the fitness area|the amenities including fridge in the room.I do not like the slow elevators in the morning and the main entrance could be a little cleaner.,1
Staff was accommodating when they could be and rooms were comfortable. There was a bit of a smell on our floor and the breakfast though free was terrible in taste. Gym was great. Close to shopping and stuff but far from wheat we came for.,1
The location and Management Staff was excellent| especially John the front desk manager. Went out of his way to make are stay enjoyable.,1
A fantastic stay and thank you to the amazing friendly helpful staff (except 1) You were amazing!|,1
It was great. We unfortunately were told to take a car service by the lobby employee. He said the gentleman used to work for the hotel| and promised a price lower than our Lyft we had requested. It was a scam. Great service until we were scammed.,1
Great location with a great staff all around. I will definitely stay again.,1
It was easy to park| check in. It's an easy walk to shopping| restaurants and activities.,1
Breakfast was awesome room was very clean friendly staff!,1
Great location and value we were so close to so many great shopping| restaurants and bars. The Windsor also had a great bar and fantastic food.,1
Hotel was in a good area (right on the magnificent mile) and the view from the window in my room was amazing. That is until I noticed that the window was leaking and created a large pool of water. Although that isnt a big downer| upon trying to take a shower I noticed a large clump of hair on the wall. Now I'm bald and my significant other is blonde| so when we saw long brunette hair high on the wall of the shower we new the room wasnt cleaned at all!,0
He made the slightly dated hotel work - reservation for restaurant- room upgrade - genuine conversations and LGBT friendly !,1
We really enjoyed our stay. The staff were cordial and the rooms were a plus,1
The property and room was very nice. The bathroom however was cramped with no fan. The parking costs were ridiculous! Way overpriced.,1
Great hotel| location is perfect right around the corner from the Mile and the Nike Store. Tons of resturants nearby including a resturant connected to the hotel with a daily 4PM happy hour. Room was great with extremely comfy beds. Great views and other amentities like a delicious daily breakfast. Plan on staying here again!,1
There was mice in my room and the manager didn't want to refund me my money. The manager on duty| John has very poor customer service skills and no empathy towards the guests. Seems to focused to hitting quota's and doesn't care about guest experience. Definitely will not be coming back here or doing business with Hampton.,0
Excellent staff & location! Very responsive to maintenance. Excellent breakfast.,1
The elevators were slow and dirty.We could hear the people in the next room.When the heat turned on it was loud and noisy.,1
The only thing I didn't care for was the wait time on the elevator. It serves 2 hotels so during certain times it took a long time.,1
The location was perfect! Easy access to the downtown.,1
The room was the biggest room I've had personally for a hotel room that's not considered a suite. Grand windows. Enough room for a makeshift wetbar.,1
From the moment I checked in (EARLY...SO accommodating) I was treated with kindness and respect. Answering questions| explaining the local area| lending me a corkscrew| and as I checked out| running down the street after the cab to tell me I had left something on the counter. The staff went above and beyond and it was greatly appreciated.The location was perfect...within walking distance of EVERYTHING and I felt safe as it was near the medical school and hospital. Will definitely return...,1
WiFi didn't work-elevators very slow-guaranteed early check in but wasn't able to check in until after the normal 3pm check in time-very clean rooms very comfortable staff very friendly,1
Large room with a decent view and very close to everything. Perfect location for our travel needs.,1
The room was facing the AC units. The room was clean but the fan in the bathroom was significantly loud and the water pressure was not good in the shower,1
Great location and the hotel was nice and clean and people were very friendly and helpful.,1
I love visiting Chicago.  My December 2018 visit was great and the Hotel I stayed at; Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile was decent. The hotel was clean and I enjoyed the complimentary breakfast.  It did get busy a few days.,1
Great hotel| location and price!!  Enjoyed the free breakfast and staff was very friendly,1
The stay was fine| nothing extra special about it| the price was great| the room was clean| the view was good.  Front desk was helpful and pleasant.  The wait on elevators was ridiculous,1
The room was clean and large. The breakfast had good selections and the staff were very prompt in refilling breakfast items. The elevators were extremely small and we waited long each time. Great location to shopping and restaurants.,1
Enjoyed our stay.  Room was fairly good size| comfortable bed.  Had a great breakfast!  Location was good| right off Michigan Ave.  The only thing I would change is a hot tub would have been nice.,1
Very nice hotel. Everyone was so helpful!,1
The door and baggage staff were wonderful. Our beds was very comfortable. Hotel is in a perfect location for shopping and dining. We did not eat the free breakfast other than bananas and coffee| but the dining area was very nice. Our only complaints were with the shower and the busy elevators  in the mornings.,1
Our heater was not working | blowing cold air took 3 different guys and 2 days to get it to work. They put it on 80 and left it| room was ridiculously hot when we returned to our room x2. Had to turn the heat off completely at night.,1
Good location| good value| within walking distance to shopping and dining.,1
Last year we stayed here the first week of December| had a wonderful time and chose to come back. We arrived early as we took the train into the city from Michigan City| planning to check our luggage and return to check in. John was on duty at the desk| immediately greeted us very warmly| told us there was a room available for us| we could check in and bring our items to the room. We also would like to mention the greeter| thinking her name was Lynnette (beautiful African American)she was amazing also| beautiful lady inside and out. We will definitely be back.,1
Would stay again. Great location. I had a king size room for 2 and the bed was super comfortable. Beautiful view and the room was clean!,1
Love the staff- very helpful very sweet. Also really engaging with your customers..,1
Nice hotel close to the beach family Life is great when. You are with family and friends,1
Great for Thanksgiving family reunion,1
Great customer service - very nice hotel| great location to Michigan Ave.  Good breakfast,1
The room was spacious and clean and quiet.  It was walking distance to a lot of places along the Mag Mile.  The complimentary breakfast was great also - they provided a lot of options and everything was yummy.  I would highly recommend.,1
The employees were amazing. I had an amazing time. I can't wait to go back.,1
Door to bathroom was broken and would not lock or stay closed| there was dust bunnies hanging from the ceiling| hair in the tub. The person checking me in gave us the wrong keys so they didn't work. I had to leave my elderly friend and go back down to get the issue fixed.,0
The staff was courteous and helpful with any assistance needed during my stay. Room was clean and location was great.,1
Friendly staff and great location. Staff on all shifts were extremely helpful to help me find way around. Included breakfast was good as well,1
The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Lynnette was a welcoming face every morning.,1
Very clean room. Excellent attention to detail. Multiple caffeinated coffee packets| bed linens were tight to the bed. Nice!,1
The breakfast area was one of the best I've seen. Food was hot| easy to get through the buffet line and the room was bright and open.,1
Second stay at this location.  Was great this time around too!,1
Clean rooms| friendly staff| very helpful valet service. Overall good experience. Recommended.,1
The pullout bed had a very bad mattress on it. Nothing but springs.,1
It was about a 30 minute walk to the start line. It was clean. Would have preferred a discount to park in the parking garage of the hotel. $60 for less than 24 hours was ridiculous.,1
The parking cost is $60 and it is only by valet parking.,1
Nice setting the room was nice for us and but we had a problem with the wifi,1
"The upgraded room I reserved (King with studio and sofa) was not available.  So they moved me to a double queen room with NO refund of the upgrade.  The Wi-Fi was so bad we couldn't even stream Spotify.  Crazy long waits at the elevators.  And signs warning you that the elevator wait times are very long| but only eight hours of the day.  Breakfast offerings were paltry--green bananas that were bruised| I'm not even sure how that happens.  The second day of our stay we received no housekeeping because our room ""wasn't on the schedule.""  The third day of our stay| I had to go down to the front desk at 4 pm and request cleaning service.  But check out day?  That day housekeeping was banging down the door at 8:32 am.  I would only recommend this hotel to someone who wants to spend very little time here as the location is great.",0
Wonderful value and great location. Rooms were clean and the breakfast was good.,1
I was able to check in at 630 am .that was worth every thing.,1
It would be nice to have a courteous front desk person greet you in a nice professional manner. Not a good 1st impression. It was always a gloom n doom person no smile and bad attitude. As far as hotel I think it was over priced. Too much noise from the streets| Maybe invest in windows that will keep noise out of room. Hard to sleep at night with that & constantly hearing sirens. The only good thing about the hotel was the breakfast it was yummy. These hard workers that maintain that area and service was awesome! Elevators were slow but location was great!,0
Great location| walking distance to many attractions.,1
Why were there protesters every single day during our stay?,1
The staff were very professional. The check-in process was very quick. All the staf were very helpful,1
Great location| very welcoming staff and very nice breakfast that was well stocked and cleaned.,1
We had a room behind the elevator| I won't let that happened again.  They don't stop until after 12 am and restart at 5 am.  Not a good room for the price you pay.,1
The bed was very comfortable and the hotel was in a great location.,1
Great location.  Clean facility. Friendly staff.   Breakfast was average| not great,1
John the front desk agent was extremely helpful. Great customer service here.,1
Great location with many shops and restaurants close by.,1
Clean| spacious hotel. Centrally located so we could walk everywhere. Staff was very helpful. John was very helpful and pleasant with checking us in and always attentive to our questions about the safety of the area| especially since we were there during the protests .  John was just quite friendly and pleasant,1
Good service and location.  Should have told us about parking cost when we made reservation.,1
How would I know|  the called 2 hours before we were to arrive and canceled our rooms. They changed them to another hotel. Rooms there were kings and we need two queens.  Not in location we wanted. But other hotel worked hard to accommodate my family.,0
Friendly staff very helpful .  Ironing board was broken and the iron did not work very well.,1
The free breakfast was a nice bonus| and it was really good| too.  The staff warned us about elevators being slow during the morning breakfast rush| but we never experienced any kind of wait.  We had a great view facing south| the beds were comfortable| and the staff were all friendly.  The location is great- just off Michigan so it's not too loud| close to both the river & the lake| and lots of good restaurants nearby.,1
Stay was great although breakfast area was extremely crowded. Also strikers were outside on Sunday.,1
Great location in downtown Chicago close to the Magnificent Mile. Complimentary breakfast with lots of options. Hotel could have been a cleaner in the common areas. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Elevators are tiny and have no air conditioning. Prepare to wait for an elevator for at least 5 minutes. A few of the hotel staff were not very helpful and check in was delayed by a half hour. There were hotel staff striking outside the hotel; I would not have booked this hotel if I would have known there was a strike occurring.,1
Great location close to shopping and dining. The staff was friendly and helpful!,1
PERFECT LOCATION!!!  Would stay here again.  The staff were really great.  Unfortunately the pool was already closed so we didn't get to use that but otherwise we had a nice experience.,1
Our room turned out to be wonderfully spacious with comfy beds and a large window front with a view of Willis Tower. The complimentary breakfast was good. Contrary to what art reviewers wrote| we never had to wait for the elevators. The staff was friendly and helpful.,1
Very pleasant stay.  Were allowed to check in early.  Nice surprise after a long drive.  Convenient to all attractions.,1
Very nice.  Great location. Friendly service.  Very clean rooms.,1
I wouldn't recommend this hotel.  About the only positive is that the bed was super comfortable.  The room had a light moldy/musty smell.  The way the shower is set you literally have to stand against the wall to shower.  The rooms have those old blow out heater/cooler which I always get a cold from.  Breakfast was fine but the room was so insanely crowded and the food set up was weird.  People were knocking into each other trying to get stuff.  All in all just an incredibly uncomfortable dining area.  The staff were not exactly pleasant or helpful.  I could not get on the internet following the directions that popped up on line when I first tried.  When I asked the next morning apparently there were directions to get on a different way other than what shows up on your computer.  Not sure why they didn't give me the directions at check-in.  Over all - a very ENH stay.  There are much nicer hotels in the city for the same price!!,0
Hotel was under strike & waited a long time for valet before they came out and told me.  Manager said he wouldn't charge me but they did & that manager wasn't there when I checked out,1
We chose this property for its brand| location and price,1
Loud AC unit| happened to stay during a hotel worker strike that happened every morning right outside our room window sometimes starting as early as 6am.,1
A lot of hidden fees. They weren't completely honest about the charges either. Never again will we stay there.,0
Good stay. Staff was helpful with me dealing with an emergency situation.,1
The room was comfortable and the bed linens were lovely,1
I stayed one night at the hotel to attend a conference in the town. The room was fairly spacious and clean. The staff were nice and the price was reasonable. I would use this hotel again.,1
My daughter had an Oncologist appointment at Northwestern and we woke up to a shower that did not work and a phone that was not working to even call the front desk for assistance. Outlets in the room were also not working. It was at best a 3 star mediocre hotel with a 5 star price tag!,0
"We went to Chicago for a concert with friends who were also staying at the hotel. When we able to get into our room we noticed it was rather warm in our room but figured it was because the blinds were not closed. We lowered the thermostat and notified the front desk who said someone would check on it. We left and went to do some sightseeing| came back and our room was STILL warm. Called down again and had someone check it once again. He felt the air coming from the vent and said ""It's blowing out air. I don't know what more you want."" After he left we lowered the thermostat even lower and left for the evening to the concert we came into town for. Came into the room and it was still warm! It was hard to sleep and felt it was useless to call guest services because we were going to get the same ""repairman"" (If that's what you want to call him.) Our friends rooms were the same way and we were sweating just waiting for the elevator!",0
The pool| which is on the 40th floor| is amazing.  It has magnificent views of the city and is open to the sky.  Incredible.  The location couldn't be better.  Beautiflu hotel.,1
Great location and the friendliest and most helpful staff! Lynette was there to greet us with a smile as we came and went and helped us find great places to eat| fun places to explore and how to get everywhere. This was my second time staying here and it's the only place I'll stay in Chicago! Also| the breakfast buffet is great!,1
This is the second time we've stayed at this hotel and we will definitely be back! The staff is so courteous| helpful| and kind. Check in and check out is a breeze and our room was very comfortable and clean. The location is perfect for getting around the downtown area and is nearby great shops and restaurants. We can't wait to go back!,1
The breakfast area was large and comfortable  we were able to easily socialize with family.,1
Loved the bed! Very cozy   Would use this property agin. Had some testing down at NWM and location was perfect.,1
We always enjoy staying at this Hampton. The rooms are spotless| beds are comfy| great views| quiet| friendly staff| and the great breakfast buffet is icing on the cake. We highly recommend this hotel.,1
We had a great time. The hotel was clean and the staff was friendly. We were in walking distance of everything from e wanted to do.,1
the pool was a lot of fun| the breakfast was good| but a little busy|Location was perfect,1
It's confusing that two hotel brands (Hampton Inn & Homewood Suites) are sharing the same space. There was a lot of disruptive traffic of cabinetry (presumably to be installed) moving into the hotel while I was there.,1
Perfect location| extremely comfy beds and clean room..free breakfast included eggs| sausage| waffles| etc. It really exceeded my expectations!,1
Great location and comfortable facilities. Bathroom can be a bit bigger and cleaner.,1
The location was awesome| and the hotel was very nice. My only complaint was the price for parking per night. They charge $60 per night when the sign on the garage offers a 24 hour early bird special for $16.,1
Overall very good broken fridge but nothing you could have predicted most importantly though you guys have a really great staff. I cant remember her name now. Younger woman at the front desk she was amazing,1
All was and went went well except slow elevators at times.,1
Great location| amazing views from the 36th floor| rooftop pool was pretty good too!,1
Comfortable hotel in a perfect location| but it would be great if coffee and tea will be available in the lounge,1
The staff is wonderful! Jimmy for the elevators and John at the front desk were especially great. Breakfast was perfect and so many options. Nothing to complain about. Perfect!,1
Nice hotel in a good location. The bed was very comfortable. However the temperature in the room was either freezing cold or burning hot. Strange that one degree up or down would make an extreme difference. The shower wasn't that great either| the head was adjustable| but barely. Overall good place to stay while seeing Chicago.,1
Great location but parking is not included and very $$. Comfy beds| spacious room and breakfast included.,1
Great location - close to Michigan Ave| Northwestern University Heath Systems and much more.,1
I would stay here again without hesitation| and have already recommended it to several people.  Great room| great bed and bedding| awesome views from the rooftop pool| delicious buffet breakfast.  Loved it!!,1
The staff was very friendly and accommodating.   The location is great-  just off Michigan and blocks from Lakshore Dr.  However| the building is old and in need of repair.  The bathroom tub had a big tear in the surface and the build up on the showerhead was unsightly.   I ended up cleaning the showerhead before use. There were also large stains on the wall under the sink.  The wait times for an elevator can be long| but the staff open up the service elevator during peak times (i.e. the breakfast rush).  I realize that location drives the price| but the bathroom seemed incongruous with a room in this price range. The staff| however|  was wonderful.,1
Location is great!  Staff was friendly and very good to deal with.  We arrived early and the hotel looked after our luggage until we returned to check in.  Check in was quick and easy.  Free breakfast was included.  Lots of hot and cold variety at breakfast.  Could have someone walking around wiping tables as people leave as it was busy.  The rooms were huge!  We had two queen beds| sofa bed| cocktail table| desk| big room off the bathroom.  The view was some more buildings but that was a great view at night.  We were right by the hospital so we thought the sirens would keep us awake but they didn't.  The housekeeper was very friendly and actually asked if there was anything we needed.  The location of this hotel was perfect.  Close to plenty of restaurants and the Hop on Hop off bus.  Would definitely stay here again. Taxis are available at the hotel so we took one to the airport which was cheaper then Uber.,1
Great stay at the Magnificent mike.,1
I stayed with my girls 10 and 13.  The pool was really fun.  The room was nice.  I got a king bed with a sofa bed.  My daughter didn't like the pull out mattress and put the couch back together and slept on it as a sofa.  The breakfast was the real deal with hot bar| oatmeal| and waffles. The other reviews warned of a slow elevator.  It was slow| but we expected this.  I found the other guests friendly and we chatted while waiting.  Lots of other families were staying there too. The location was great.,1
Had a doctor appointment at northwestern so chose to stay the night here. Breakfast was the only disappointment. Very crowded and quality not very good.,1
Great location! Cannot beat the complimentary breakfast. Parking was easy and convenient. Rooms were spacious and had great views of the city. Staff went above and beyond as well!,1
Very friendly staff; hotel is within walking distance to everything we wanted to see; the river walk and the shore line walk are a stone's throw away.,1
Loved the hotel and the area was close to everything. My only gripe was the $60 / night parking fee and the morning we left I called ahead to get my car and they brought the wrong car and then argued with me that it was my car... I waited 45 minutes before they brought my car down.,1
The room was very nice|  neat and clesn and it was a pleasant experience.,1
MUY BUENA UBICACION LE FALTA RENOVAR UN POCO PERO EL HOTEL ESTA BUENO,1
Very good| near to town| good breakfast!,1
This is a good hotel| located close to all the attractions of Chicago| suitable for those who consider their money and value time. large room| it has everything except the mini-bar. but my question about drinking water was given to me at the reception without words. A deposit of $ 200 came as a surprise. as disposable paper utensils for breakfast. breakfast is sufficient. I will stay in it again.,1
ideally situated if you want to go for a shopping spree on the Magnificent Mile!,1
Staff was friendly| but the cleaning could improve. Some area were not even clean and didn't replace paper cups that we used for coffe,1
Hotel served its purpose for one night stay. Room was clean and comfortable| but our neighbors were loud. There is no valet or parking garage| but the is fee to park in a open parking lot at hotel. The only thing complimentary is coffee and the store wasn't stocked. Definitely recommend bring water and snacks.,1
Property is clean. Next to freeway but quiet. Far from other hotels.. Front desk did not explain in detail that rooms would only be cleaned with 24 hour request in advance. Parking is $15 but wasn't hard to find (should just include it in the price). Pool was closed but also not notified until arrival (okay for me but families with kids seemed disappointed). Staff is efficient but not outgoing or very friendly.,1
Says free breakfast there wasn't any breakfast says indoor pool pool was out of service they should mention that before people book rooms,0
Spacious room and in great condition. The problem is getting to hotel from SFO airport which is 10min away at any time of the day| their shuttle service to/ from airport is very limited- within 3 hour-gap early in the morning and 3 hour-gap at night. Plus hotel is very far from public transportation. Ultimately I will never stay at this hotel again because I spent more on Uber and Lyft rides.I recommend another Double Tree| not this at North location.,1
I was disappointed because one of the bedsheet and pillow sheet had little blood stain on it. Bathroom had mold. If we were staying more than a night I would've left and go to a different hotel,0
Always stay here on our trips to San Francisco. Always very clean and quiet and not to far of a drive to the city. Highly recommend,1
The road entrance is all tore up very very rough road,1
Business trip and the hotel was convenient.  Nothing special.,1
Clean| quiet| and comfortable. Lauren was super nice and went out of her way to make sure everything was above our expectations. Highly recommended hotel.,1
Property and room was very clean. Staff was very friendly and helpful.,1
You can never go wrong with a Double Tree from my experience. THe rooms are always clean| the beds comfy| and the staff cool. I was disappointed that the hot tub was not working and the pool was unseasonably cold. But overall| a great time was had by all.,1
When we were about to check in| they couldn't find our room that we booked through Expedia. And when we showed them our confirmation email| they said they never got anything from Expedia. So we never got the room that we initially booked and they had to put us in a handicapped room. The room was okay| the bathroom smelled and the lightbulbs were out on one of the lamps| and lastly the fridge didn't function properly.,0
It had easy access to the highway.  The hot tub is included as an amenity but was closed for unspecified reasons.  The reviews said parking was free which was a huge enticement but when we checked in we were told it's $15/day ($85) that was not told in advance when factoring finances.,0
Average cleanliness.  Bed and sheets smelled.  I expected more during a pandemic.,1
Nice Hotel spent one night during covid bar was closed I would recommend hotel close to airport,1
Everything you would find at motel six. Ugly art| ugly furniture| rude staff. Even there coffee sucks. Many customers not wearing mask!. I paid for the Hilton and they delivered motel six. By the way if you decide to stay there be prepared to be charged extra! I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. And the location is terrible. There is not one convenient location for food or anything. Even the parking is terrible. They charge 15 dollars to park and the take no responsibility. I have traveled the world! This place is absolutely below any property of the Hilton I have ever stayed. I regret staying here and I will tell ever person I know. This place is a dump !,0
Horrible CUSTOMER SERVICE!,0
Clean and great price.,1
Not friendly| no healthy choice coffee for people who can't have caffeine| the coffee maker in the room did not work. The girl who work a the front desk very rude and cross. Will not stay there again.,0
Good location pleasant and clean hotel.,1
Check-in was fantastic. I arrived earlier than planned and asked if they had a locker I can store my luggage. Gustavo offered to check if my room was available and yes it was!! Thank you for a great stay. Will be back!,1
Was great but what about the cookies üç™,1
Building is brand new| very nice| about 1/4 mile from the marina where |y boat is slipped| I've watched them build it. After getting caught in some very rough weather my boat was soaked| needed a comfortable place to stay. This place definitely fit the bill| it's immaculate| staff was friendly and helpful| pleasant stay. I'll be back.,1
The stay eas exceptional and the front desk people were all really friendly and helpful on every shift. I got ro walk to the trail alomg the water and continue my workout. I would recommend.,1
"The staff was very friendly when I arrived. There was a blue tag on the door to my room stating it had been cleaned. But when I went into my room it did not appear to have been ""covid cleaned"". There was residue all over the bathroom door| the shower looked like it hadn't been cleaned| there was left over trail mix on the floor next to the bed and the comforter had something black stuck to it but was covered by two thin sheets on top and bottom. No where on the site said there would be a $15 parking fee. You had to reserve a spot for the gym or pool which is understandable during covid. Overall was very disappointed in how market their cleanliness when a 5 year would have done a better job. The front desk staff was friendly though. I will be staying at a different hotel next time I'm in SF.",0
Room was great| when we stayed and extra day the room was not clean and that was a disappointment.Other than that| great!!!,1
Nice and clean,1
My toilet did not flush properly| would have to flush teice. The toilet water would run all night and I would have to lift the tanks to stop it from running. When we arrived the toilet had hair on it. The tub did not drain while water was running and I would stand in a pool of water while showering.The location of the hotel was beautiful. It was in the bay.,1
I didn't like the fact that it didn't serve breakfast and had to pay for parking.,1
Everything was really nice |staff is really friendly definitely stay there again .,1
Very Clean Big Tvs Comfy Beds Quiet Hotel Was Upset Because I Really Wanted To Get In Hot Tub,1
Only stayed one night. It was clean| quiet. Onsite parking for $14.99. Close to San Franscisco city center.,1
Loved the area near the water ..the hotel is beautiful. N clean  but thought the parking fee was an added cost I was not expecting .. bummer for me. Overall my stay was amazing !! Will be back again,1
The 1st room we stayed in was not good. There were ants in the bathroom and something that looked like blood on the floor| I did not stay to find out. Moved rooms/ floor and this room was much better. At first the TV in the new room didnt work| but banged on the remote and it worked just fine. This floor had more people on it. and across the hall was some sort of bachelorette part going on| but nothing to bad.  would stay here again.,1
Very friendly receptionist checking me in. Had no problems whatsoever. Would recommend staying here!,1
I like the bed. It was very comfortable. Had to pay for parking,1
It's nice place| but very far interest of place,1
Great staff| clean quiet rooms and a place to sleep without paying the high hotel fees in San Francisco.,1
It was a nice hotel but there was hair in the bathroom in random areas.,1
I booked this hotel because DoubleTree by Hilton but....It is place for teenagers party. I was informed that there is restaurant but it was closed 9 months ago so I have to drive to pick up for Dinner at New Year's Eve. I paid extra for getting ocean view but it was tiny lake view over the other building. No soundproof at all| Sewer smell in bathroom. It was worst hotel I never seen.,0
Very clean|  friendly|  and accessible hotel. Staff was very accomadating|  rooms were spotless and quiet.,1
Customer service was very bad. The staff does not know how to talk to the customers and you can tell they don't enjoy their jobs.,0
Good hotel but Nothing interesting surrounding the area.,1
Business was shut down.,0
First going to start with the positive of this hotel. Great room| comfortable bed| extra clean room specially during COVID.The 1 star comes from the rude female receptionist| unfriendly and unwelcoming. Never thought somebody like that would qualify to work at a Hilton. Another reason is because we paid for a bay view and we were given a room on the 5th floor out of 8th with tree views not the bay which is what we paid for. In addition| the hotel requires you to pay $15 for parking when they have plenty of space to park.Also.... no airport shuttle.,0
Shower was not clean. Disappointing!! The room was very dusty.,0
Customer service was the best. Welcoming and kind. Friendly.  Checked in and checked out with ease. My room was comfortable. Thank you Doubletree. I will stay with you again.,1
We booked this hotel so we could stay near the San Francisco airport since our flight to Cancun was early in the morning. The staff at that hotel are not friendly at all. They do not make you feel welcome. We were tired and we went to bed I was laying down on the bed and my youngest son screamed and said there was a bug crawling on my bed. I immediately got up and it was a bug crawling on my sheet. I took a picture of the bug and I went on google and the bug was in fact a bed bug! I was so disgusted because me and my family have never experienced anything like this and we never expected this from this hotel. I immediately got up and talked to the hotel staff about it and the guy that was there looked at me as if it was nothing bad. He don't even apologize about it. He was just staring at me so I told that I was not going to have my family stay in that room. So he then switched our room and we had to move all of our belongings to another room late at night. We will never go back to that hotel. Everyone there looks like they don't like their job and they are forced to be there.,0
No cookies| is it still doubletree?  Called twice to ask about airport shuttle.  First call they said yes and second call they confirmed no.,1
Author Wood was very unprofessional and rude . His demeanor screamed that he didn't give a damn the way he came off .,0
Nothing| my room that i had booked through expedia was not given to me.  The hotel stated that booking through expedia or 3rd party you wont get the room you booked.  So basically saying not to book through a 3rd party because they lie the to customer.,0
Hotel is nice| decent enough area although going to anything on the other side of the freeway is a little inconvenient but not unmanageable. When we first checked in we were given a room on the second floor| smelled musty| toilet water low| dead bugs in the bath tub and no covid measures stated... went downstairs and explained it to the concierge. He apologized and gave us a different room on the 3rd floor. Much nicer| smelled clean| had a clean seal sticker on door when we entered and a stack of wet wipes for hands by the tv. Very happen and felt safe in the 3rd floor room so no direct complaints as the original issue was easily resolved.,1
Hotel management excellent. Prefer real breakfast over bagged breakfast. Other hotels do a regular setup but have single point of contact to retrieve breakfast.,1
Staff was away from the front desk when I arrived. Someone she was talking to finally told her she had someone waiting a d then she came to check me in.  Check in was easy and fasy.  Rooms were mostly comfortable except blood stains on sheets| very soft pillows and no fan in the bathroom.  Loved the see through fridge so nothing was forgotten.  Room was clean.  Ample on-site parking.,1
I have to come down to the bay area to see my doctor at UCSF| I have stayed here the last couple of times. I love this hotel| it's beautiful| staff is excellent.,1
Convenient location.  Comfortable bed.  Friendly receptionist.,1
A good place to stay| close to the airport and close enough to the city. Quiet area. Doubletree quality.,1
Gustavo de Almeida is a manager with low standards which are reflected in the care of this hotel. His eye for detail misses more than it observes which is why Gustavo makes numerous mistakes on charging| offering amenities and essentially performing his job to Hilton standards. The Larkspur or Hotel Dylan are close by| better suited| alternatives.,0
It's by the airport but we had a truck to get where we needed to go it was clean friendly and everything was not to far away it was a great stay I would do it again,1
Booked a room with a bay view and was disappointed. The rooms are dark and the view is minimal. Walls are super thin.  First we had an issue with hearing the elevators. After arguing with the staff to be moved to another room| during which we were told the hotel was full only to find out later than multiple floors were currently unfilled| we were offered a lesser accommodation without a view or  refund. After further negotiation|  we were given a equal accommodation| but we could hear the couple in the room next to us talking and having sex all night because the walls are so thin. We were then woken up at 6:00 am by the sound of trucks backing up at the construction site next door. When checking out early the manager attempted to get us to stay by offering us an entire for to ourselves with anything we needed. The stay was so bad|  we gladly left despite the offer.,0
Excellent facility with professional staff and location,1
At check-in we were not greeted with a friendly staff|  didn't engage in conversation.  All she talked about with the guest before me was about Covid-19 and how she felt about it| nothing about the hotel at all. The hallway in the guestrooms smelled like skunk. The sheets and comforters were old| replacement needed. There were no iron| microwave or blowdryer. We left a message at the front desk but never returned our call. Saw a few housekeepers and they were so aloof. We asked for coffee cups at the front desk and the agent gave us unwrapped cups and didn't give us lids üòï the following day| we asked for cups again| this time the male front desk agent was nicer| he let us get the cups ourselves. We checked out at 4am| the agent was busy putting some bottled waters in brown bag (we didn't get that welcome bag) and when I told her that I was checking out| she said ok we'll just email you the receipt| like I was a bother for interrupting what she was doing. Wish we could have chosen a better hotel. üò£,0
I know there is Covid and all but my stay was not what I expected. No microwave in rooms and no toilet paper or towels Had to ask also for shampoo. No room cleaning or products to clean available. I was there 3 days and at 2:30 am on my day of check out someone was smoking in there room and alarms went off. I had to walk down 6 flights of stairs and evacuate. I ended checking out early. Most scary stay ever.,0
I would not recommend this hotel. We checked into our room it had iron| no blow dryer| the sink was backed up and room smelled of smoke. They ended up switching us rooms but the room door lock did not work properly and someone tried to get into our room at 2am and was able to open the door thank god we had the bar lock on otherwise they would have been able to get in. We have stayed at many different Double Tree's and have always had great experiences but this particular hotel I would not recommend.,0
nice property and good value. perhaps due to the pandemic| mid-stay cleaning was subpar.,1
Nice view of the marina and close to the freeway. Definitely would stay here again,1
Theocation was good and the property was clean. I will stay here again,1
Because the shuttle service was not operating from SFO| the cost to and from the hotel added another $45 to the tab. However| once at the hotel| everything was first-rate.,1
$100 incidentals fee and $15 for ‚Äúoptional‚Äù parking pass with no other option for parking. Front desk staff was less than friendly. Then had to dispute charges that were made to my room for room service etc.,0
I understand that we are in this new corvid-19 situation but 1. I booked a king suite for my family and I ...but when checking in the front desk person told me they were out of the suite rooms.  She blamed it on 3rd party booking but I checked with Double Trees website and it still had those rooms available.2.  While I was checking in a security guard came to the front desk| chatted with the front desk clerk.  The clerk asked the security guard to wear his mask and the guard  proceeded to use profanity about not wearing a mask???!!!  Right in front me!3. The parking lot was full of garbage| cans of beer! it literally felt I was at a tailgate party!I will not be staying at this Hilton Hotel again!,0
With Covid-19| one would think the hotel rooms would be cleaned/sanitized properly. My husband and I| wiped everything down with Lysol| as we usually do wherever we stay| and found the towel filthy brown from dust and what not. Took the towel to front desk and let my concern be known.As a result| we will no longer stay at this hotel.,0
Friendly staff| clean room and convenient location to airport and downtown.,1
I loved everything about this hotel. Cant wait to stau again,1
It was quiet| clean and had a nice amenities. Breakfast was great a lot of healthy choices. Staffs are friendly and accommodating.,1
I did not like that the breakfast is not included other than that it was nice and clean,1
I only had issues with checking in everything else was great,1
The check-in was HORRIBLE!! The lady named Stella treated us super bad and didn't give us the attention we needed after traveling 12 hours by car. She needs to know how to treat the guests better| it was definitely a really bad experience for me and my family. That's sad because a famous hotel like the Hilton company| I believe they should select better their employees.,1
hotel is very clean| pool is awesome| food was great| love this hotel and only 20 minutes to downtown... Oakland is firkin filty and wouldn't go there again...,1
Everything.. all good üòäWelcome cookiesConvertible room| love the bed üòä,1
I was able to check in after hours with no problem.,1
Our room was in excellent conditions and we got free cookies at check-in. My only complaint is that they charge $15 to park on their lot -.-,1
Great beds. Tv location,1
Very clean and quiet . The room was a good size . I stayed there over 10 years ago and still beautiful. Can't wait to go back .,1
The room only had a below window HVAC unit. We needed the heat. It was noise and had to cycle about every 20 minutes...all night long. The wife liked the white noise| not me. The hot tub needed a water change bad. There was excessive foam when the jets where on. Otherwise| great access to the city and easy parking. Beds were also comfortable.,1
Our stay was fabulous and the hotel was clean and comfy. The only negative was the hidden fees we were charged and did not know about until we checked in. We are waiting to see if the so-called incendiary fees will be refunded.,1
The lobby was clean and welcoming. The staff was friendly and very helpful. The rooms were clean and comfy.,1
My only complaint was with the loud heating/air conditioning unit. Otherwise| my stay was a pleasant experience!,1
What I enjoyed most about the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North was the shower head in the tub bathroom.,1
Double Tree hotels can always be counted on for cleanliness| and who can beat the delicious cookies?  I also love the soaps and lotions provided. My only complaint was that there was a very long wait between airport shuttles.,1
Try to order food through room service goes to some recording called front desk she laughs and transfers me to a recording again .. 40 min of wasted time and no food .,0
We had a great one night stay! Room was very clean| bed was comfortable| staff was friendly. The restaurant had delicious food (especially the cali-quinoa salad!). We used the gym for the first time ever at a hotel. It was small but had everything we needed. The pool was out of order but not a big deal. The only thing I hope they add in the future is a fan in the bathroom! It was always very warm in there| especially after showering. The hotel is very close to the highway which was super convenient. We would definitely stay here again in the future.,1
The shuttle to the airport was easy to get to and the driver was friendly.,1
This property is under construction. The lobby is gone. The hallways have plastic all over it. The front desk is a room on the side. Was charged full price for a room and hotel in disarray. They should not be even be open during this. It's a embarrassment to the company name.,0
EXCELLENT!! A little excluded from the city but comfortable and a quiet place. That view though.,1
The hotel is new| clean| and comfortable. The room size is big. The location is good to visit San Francisco or to SFO airport.,1
Good customer service.  Quiet and convenient location to several attractions.,1
My stay was very clean and everything was at minimum 10 minutes away. I felt cozy and comfortable here and was not greater with disrespect. Plus the warm cookies they offer are great.,1
Great location and around 10 minutes to drive into SF but it seemed that every night we got a new guest in the room next to us who didn't want to go to sleep. Numerous times I called down to the front desk to ask them to get the guests next door to be quiet at times well after 1am.,0
Great staff and nice hotel,1
very good| except for heavy quilt instead of blanket (too hot),1
Very quick check in| easy to access room and quiet!,1
Great hotel| clean and comfortable,1
The checkout experience was terrible. First a long time to wait to have the final receipt. Second a mistake on the receipt| same charge charged twice. Very unfriendly staff to finally fix it. Waiting to see my cc statement to check,0
The hotel locates at a beautiful quite location. The room was spacious and neat. We had a great stay!,1
Great property| located near Downton (without paying parking)Near the airport as well. not may restaurants nearby though,1
I had a wonderful stay at the Double Tree Hotel. Staff are friendly and the place is clean and has easy access to the freeway. I will definitely go back.,1
Clean| easy to access| not too noisy| free parking.,1
The property was great. My problem was checking in. My full name didn't show up while checking in. They had my first name and 2 letters of my middle name. NO LAST NAME. That's it. Luckily I had my confirmation number. It can't be that hard to transfer information.,1
The room was nice| no microwave.  Construction all around the area didn't care for their smoking section by the front entrance,1
Overnight stop before flying on the next day. Ideal hotel location with free airport shuttle. Clean and comfortable.,1
Hotel didn't have my room available upon arrival.Great location,1
We go to dam Fran every year| used to stay at different hotels| until we found this gem. We start wit this property every time because it feels like home. A little travel to get to the city but so worth it. Everything about this hotel is perfect!!,1
Back at this hotel after 2 months and I like it. Going south on the 101 (Airport) not a quickly exit| but I can live with that.,1
Everything was very nice from the room to the lobby.  Easy location to get to as well.,1
The hotel was very clean| the staff superb. clise to evetything,1
Great option near the airport.  Ate in the bar two nights as a matter of convenience| food was really good.  Room was great.  Comfortable bed.  Solid front desk staff.,1
Was looking forward to staying here| but never made it since our travel plans were delayed. Room was prepaid and no refund was provided.,0
Rooms are large| clean and well maintained. Very friendly staff. A very nice hotel.,1
The cookies are the best...I just love the cookies!,1
"Not happy about anything regarding my stay.I drove all the way from Canada| for 15-16 hours straight on the road. I booked the hotel 2-3 hours before i got there. There were 3-4 adults| I ordered a room with 2 queen beds. I get there and they give me my room| I go upstairs and guess what| only 1 bed and the best part is the front staff didn't even tell me| so thanks for that!I go downstairs and tell them I had two queen beds and they said ""oh sorry we sold out and don't have that room available. I am very disappointed| I was extremely tired from driving for all those hours and I would have loved to sleep on my own bed except I had to sleep on a single bed that they drag in from who knows where.This was my first and definitely last time that I will be going to a Hilton owned hotel. Thanks for nothing.",0
Commentary:Bathroom door swing open toward the wall mounted mirror. Towel rack mounted above comode.,1
The carpets were really dirty. The shower has low pressure water. The ac unit did not work properly. We had to evacuate the hotel because the hotel had an issue on the 2nd floor with a dryer. There wasn't a fire but we were rushed out of the hotel and forced to check out early.,0
Clean place| very nice and convenient restaurant  and bar inside,1
This location was great. Restaurant for breakfast and dinner was super good too..  Stuff help me get inside the room super fast . And. Had a welcome smile on there face..Thanks again'Would like to come back soonFor sure',1
The facility was nice and clean. Had wonderful staff. Parking was so easy and lot of it. My favorite part was the soaps and shampoos smelled so amazing I didn't even use the products I brought with me. Such a great stay. Easy to get onto freeway to access San Francisco.,1
We had a clean room. One of the beds was uncomfortable. Staff was very friendly. Tub did not drain really good. We would definitely stay here again. Cookies were amazing as usual!,1
Facility was very well kept.  There was an initial problem with the carpet being wet near the AC but the staff took care of it quickly and provided breakfast voucher compensation to remedy the situation.  Very professional.,1
The Hotel was very clean like new and the staff was very helpful. The food was good too!,1
I was a very nice place to stay. No ocean views but a nice quiet place to relax and SF is only a few miles away.  Plus Free Parking!,1
Very nice updated hotel. The attendent at check in was very nice about accomodating 2 parking passes. The chocolate chip cookies dont hurt either. üòä,1
The hotel itself was in a good position for driving into San Francisco and also the airport. Front desk staff were very friendly and helpful....the cookies went down well too!,1
Really frustrating. I called ahead to include parking| got a reservation agent who said they had added it and I wouldn't be charged. Then when I came with a 3 year old to check in they told me they wouldn't honor that and charged me for the 3 days I left my car. They did say I could cancel without penalty| which was a bit ridiculous given the 3 year old and late time of night. Couldn't believe the poor customer service. I wont choose to stay at this brand hotel again. They acknowledged three people had said the same thing but wouldn't honor what I had been told on the phone.,0
The picture and the property were two different things ! There is nothing within walking didtance of the hotel fof dining etc. The hotel itself was nice with good amenities| plenty of parking and free airport shuttle  close to freeway so was a bit of road noise. On the whole| good staff| nice stay,1
Close to SFO| clean room|  cookies at check in.  That's all I need.,1
Comfortable just overnight stay,1
Nice clean room. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable in explaining the area.,1
The staff was friendly and professional. Hotel was clean. I plan on returning to this location in future. I highly recommend this hotel,1
We were a bit disappointed by the fact there was no microwave oven in the room.,1
Good stay| near at the Airport but non at the Downtown.,1
It was excellent Nice clean room,1
Nice hotel| friendly staff| very good place to stay for visiting San Francisco,1
This was a great hotel.  Clean| quiet| convenient to the airport.,1
Great location near the airport (15 minute driving)No air plane noise at all. Very quite20 minutes driving to most of San Francisco In rush hour no more than 30 minute,1
This is an amazing hotel. Staff were great! Not too far from.downtown SF.,1
"the fruit-flavored waters in the lobby were a treat!  Staff were friendly.  Our room's air conditioner was leaking moisture and it made the carpet soaked around the A/C unit.  We paid extra for a ""marina view"" and the view was not something I would have paid extra for had I known what a lousy view it was.",1
Staff and room are great! The water in the pool looks like it hasn't been clean for awhile.,1
Aunts everywhere in the room!! It was too late for to change over the room! Expedia  service was soo bad and misleading! I guarantee you I will NEVER EVER book ANY of my trips with them!,0
Hotel is clean. The only thing I don't like is there's no Microwave in the hotel.Thanks|,1
Friendly staff and clean rooms! I was given 2 free bottles of water and 3 cookies!,1
We had an enjoyable stay| will stay there again. It's in a very quiet neighborhood area.,1
Very nice hotel! Close to everything. Excellent cost. For a hotel this nice to only pay a little over $300.00 for a two night weekend stay is a tremendous bargain. Plenty of parking with no parking fees is a bonus. Would definitely stay again!,1
Close to freeway access | parking is an issue | the area is quiet with no issues,1
Nice hotel with free shuttle to the airport every 30 min.  Made it easy to catch Bart to SF.,1
Everything was great other than issue with the toilet and had to call| no answer| go to front desk| & then waited 30 mins in maintenance| & then called again & they finally sent someone.,1
Close to the airport and parking facilities are excellent,1
The overall stay was good.  My only complaint is that the coffee bar (free coffee) was only open until 8. I don't remember seeing anything that stated the coffee bar's hours. Thankfully the cleaning staff gave me another cup and creamer for the coffee in my room.,1
The hotel was great and the room was spacious. Access to highway was great. Other than the hotel restaurant you need to travel a bit for restaurant options. Brisbane had some great options though if you are OK with driving 10 minutes or so.,1
Hotel was very nice. Immaculate| spacious room with all needed amenities.  Restaurant was great.  Wifi great. Beds were very comfortable. Good location - quick 10 minute ride into the city. Would definitely reccomend,1
Quiet. Location. Nice view. Convenient. Close to the airport and city.,1
Clean and conveniently locted. Great staff all through out our stay,1
It is convenient for those who need to park and go to the airport. It's also convenient to stay and catch an Uber into the city.,1
Clean and good service.,1
Room was nice big and clean. Loved that they offered free water and coffee and day long. Although the buffet was a little pricey it was worth it with the  variety food. Waiter was awesome,1
The DoubleTree by Hilton was the worst customer service ever. We found bedbugs an actual bedbug and my wife was left with bites and the front desk couldn't do anything because the manager was not in. Then they had the technician change his story and say that the bug he confirmed was a bedbug| was a woodchip. Very poorly managed and sneaky! I had to throw away all my belongings and they could not even give me half off my stay. They are liars I have pictures of everything so think twice before staying here.,0
The property was confusing to get to at night from the freeway. Parking was not available at the site and had to park at the overflow parking. Rooms were very dark and lighting was not enough during the night. Overall experience was not at Doubletree quality.,0
love the indoor pool for the kids,1
Great hotel but an odd area. Gas stations| restaurants| etc are all a few mile drive. It looks closer on the map| but because of the roads and exits| its at least 10-15min to get to gas station! And considering that there is very limited parking at the hotel (it took me about 10-15min to get a spot and also saw others complaining the next night) - it is difficult to leave since you may give up your parking space. The room and staff were great though. If you are visiting a business in that area or not driving/renting a car - its a great property.,1
The room and facility is clean and comfortable.,1
Excellent service from everyone.... including Lily and the chef... enjoyed his food very much... watermelon salad with fried shrimp! Excellent!!!!! I was in room 225 ... no view but I was exhausted ... great sleep... very quiet... I would definitely stay here again!!,1
Nice hotel very close to the city. Would stay again,1
We booked two rooms but they only had one room available for us. They were unwilling to help us. We ended up booking a second room last minute for my family.,0
Clean| comfortable.  Upset that it was difficult to get a hold of someone up front to ket them know about lats arrival.  Also disappointed in the pool - only 3 ft???,1
Convenient to Golden Gate Bridge and downtown San Francisco. About 1/2 hour. Reception was most helpful with suggestions. Very good breakfast Short shuttle trip to airport.,1
Room was very clean| we enjoyed the short stay.  But we missed the shuttle bus to the airport the next day| and I wish the shuttle was provided more frequently.,1
The only negative is parking space is not enough. 2 nights in a row we parked at the overflow lot which is a dark unlit walk back to the hotel,1
Friendly staff and clean room. Nice gym and pool. Easy check in and out,1
Location close to the airport was definitely a plus.  Not too mention the other amenities close by.,1
The price was reasonable for the location.,1
I loved everything about this hotel '!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
Terrible service| dirty hotel| deteriorating conditions.  They boast of their easy and convenient airport shuttle| which was anything but.  It took the shuttle over 40 minutes to pick  us up.  Once the driver arrived| he lied and said the back door to the van was broken and that we would have to lug our own luggage up the three stairs and figure out where to accommodate them within a narrow space.  Please note| every other shuttle service had a driver that was helping passengers accommodate their luggage| especially larger suitcases.  Once we arrived at the first hotel drop off| we switched drivers and the very nice female over immediately opened up the doors to the back of the van and miraculously was helping passengers store luggage.  I reported this to the hotel upon my arrival| no one cared.  The elevator doors and property in general is run down and dirty| my room smelled of mildew and the shower was not clean.  All my issues were reported and not a apology| extra cookie| NOTHING because they don't seem to give a darn about their customer.  I would rather sleep in the airport than to ever waste $300 a night staying at this hotel,0
I originally requested for conjoining rooms on the phone a week before arrival and the concierge confirmed it was available. However| upon arrival| we were told conjoining rooms were unavailable. Slightly disappointed.,1
The hotel is great but room walls very thin| staff very friendly,1
Kids love the indoor pool and the cookies at check in,1
good condition and comfotable to stay.  room was clean.,1
I really loved the look and feel of this hotel. It was clean and the bed were comfortable. I also want to commend the staff for such a great buffet setup in their restaurant down near the lobby. Had an excellent stay. I will definitely use you guys again if Im ever back in town.,1
Friendly service| cookie at check-in was a nice treat!,1
Cleanliness. The location is right outside of the business of SF where I can park and be at peace for a good night sleep.,1
Super friendly staff and with free cookies on your arrival.,1
The layout on the first floor is a little awkward but everything else was outstanding,1
We love staying here. It's so comfy and always clean. Please don't change a thing.,1
Very good and convenient hotelThe staff was really nice and accommodating. The property was much quieter than I expected and it was perfect to be able to walk to the boardwalk nearby.,1
Everyone was so nice we loved our stay. The hotel was close to the airport and to the freeway.,1
Love how clean it was and the bed was super big and comfy!,1
Only downside is nothing is walking distance away.,1
Hand sink plug and Odor smell from the pipe. Towels are old,0
Proximity to airport and scheduled meetings was great.,1
Sad the cookies were OOS but otherwise it was wonderful from start to finish. Had to book last minute due to flight issues and had no problem with check-in or responsiveness. Great help over the phone| lovely in person| and facilities were great. Also easily gave an extended checkout when we let them know our flight was much later in the day than anticipated. I would stay here again| no question.,1
Not enough parking space at night,1
Stay one night since it's close to SFO.,1
Staff was very polite and gracious. Lobby is comfortable and practical.,1
I had Iris helped me Checked in late Friday night (4/5/19) told her that parking lot was full| without hesitation she told me| she still have in,1
Very comfortable and clean room. Staff very courteous and friendly,1
The staff were friendly and the hotel was very nicely maintained. The room was clean| quiet and extremely comfortable. The shuttle from the airport was frequent and arrived right on time (both to and from the airport). I will definitely stay here again for flights out of SFO.,1
Great stay.,1
Staff was nice and we enjoyed our stay everything was clean. Price was great and bed was very comfortable,1
The hotel was quiet. The restaurant was decent. Check in and out was smooth. Overall| I had a very good experience at this hotel.,1
I booked for 2 queen beds but as soon as checked in at the front desk| I'm told that I was booked for I king size bed. She said that's how it came through to their system. I've used Expedia for more than 10 years and this is the first time this happened,0
Great staff.  I just wished there was like a free breakfast. But all in all| a very pleasant stay,1
Staff was accommodating.,1
I enjoyed the floor level I stayed on. It was quiet for my restful stay.,1
Very convenient and pleasant,1
It was immaculately clean. The gym is small but has plenty of varied equipment where you can get a decent workout in.,1
Close proximity to downtown. It was nice and clean. We'd definitely stay again.,1
I chose this hotel for its proximity to the airport and its airport shuttle. I didn't realize the shuttle runs once every 35 minutes and waited a long time outside the airport to be picked up. Other than that| it was very comfortable and clean| and the bar was a pleasant place to grab a late supper.,1
Very friendly check in! The room was clean and the kids loved the indoor pool.,1
Perfect location if you want to be close to san Francisco but not pay the san Francisco hotel price. Indoor pool was nice. The only complaint was the poor service in their restaurant with over priced mediocre food.,1
It was good.Comfortable| clean|Easy access to the airport and local events,1
Room service was extremely rude. They didn't answer all night into the morning and I eventually had to call the front desk. Front desk said she would have them call me and they never did. I ordered two drinks and never got them and the food from breakfast arrived cold. When I finally got ahold of them| they were very nonchalant and aggressive. ‚ÄúWhat else you want?‚Äù. I was hung up on twice instead of saying goodbye when I was done talking.,0
The rooms were very clean and comfortable. Customer service was exceptional.,1
Close to downtown San Francisco . Nice area| parking is free,1
The staff was very friendly and welcoming. The hotel is in great condition| clean and we had a very comfortable stay. The indoor pool was a plus. Every staff member we had an encounter with including front desk| housekeeping| maintenance and restaurant staff was great. Will definitely stay again.,1
The hotel and staff are top notch the friendliness and attention to all our needs we met with no hassle which is greatly appreciated we would stay here every time we visited Brisbane California,1
I booked yhis hotel for the pool and hot tub but they were broken.,0
I liked the feeling that it was safe and the cookies. Its a business style but for someone on a road trip it was secure unlike the common car break in's in SF. Our bag was lost and damaged on united but delivered and we were notifed from front desk:) Thank you !!,1
Room was clean and check in was easy. The pool area was nice and my toddler enjoyed it.,1
The hotel staff was welcoming and pleasant and not to mention very clean establishment.,1
Nice| clean| very nice and helpful staff. Nice to have the impossible burger as a vegan option in the restaurant.,1
Nice hotel & nice staff| but I booked two queen beds room.But they said there are no more rooms available and gave me a one king bed...,0
It was Clean and friendly. Stylish decor. Fast check I and check out.,1
Just stayed for one night| but was everything I was looking for. Very clean| quiet| comfortable bed| good service| all the amenities. I was traveling alone and looking for a safe comfortable place to stay - was perfect.,1
Staff was very friendly and helpful...place was very clean and nice...not a lot to do nearby but the hotel itself was very nice.,1
Lime water served in front. Restaurant in hotel. Pool and gym amenities,1
No restaurants close by| otherwise pretty good.  Rides to San Francisco on Uber generally much cheaper than parking there.,1
Everything was good until they ran out of parking and we had to park far away from the hotel.,1
Location was great and appreciated that there was no charge for parking.  Only thing is there are no restaurants nearby.,1
Check in staff did not explain how to get to the room and details of charges- difference from travelocity price. Room a/c was broken and very noisy.Fewer glasses/cups| fewer towels| no water bottles(comes w stay)| stains on sheet...Water w fruited was nice. Indoor pool was nice.,0
Excellent hotel| clean and safe. Friendly staff. Shuttle is somewhat slow but otherwise great hotel,1
The staff were very friendly| specially at the restaurant.,1
I had reserved 1 king bed suite| checked in at 9:30PM& got our keys to the room and got 2 double beds. Called front desk and got the right room| it was 10PM by then| I could've been resting after a long drive. Next night| I was woken up at 2AM from a phonecall from the front desk| when I answered it| it was just the dial tone. 3-5 minutes later there was a knock at my door. Looked at the peephole and no one was there. Turns out| nextdoor was complaining about the tv volume which was at a 10. I have sleeping issues and in order to sleep| I need noise in the background. Mind you| this was our last night at the hotel. Lost my good nights rest because walls are too thin| not my fault. At 1AM| I could hear children screaming and yelling. Will not be staying here again.,0
Great location parking and clean rooms enjoyed our stay highly recommend,1
very clean hotel. probably the only place I found that still offer free parking. I wish they would start offering free breakfast. Overall nice place to stay near the city,1
Hotel was nice and close enough to downtown but had a late check in and was not informed when room was ready.,1
Perfect blend of  convenient access to airport without airport noise. A door attendant to assist with luggage would be a good improvement.,1
It is a perfect place when you have cars.  It is away from the city center but near the airport.,1
It was ver good but the room was not in front of the ocean,1
Our rooms were already taken. Had to go to a different hotel. Not happy!,0
The service was top notch. I arrived at 9pm and had no problems with a late check in. We received warm cookies and chocolate upon checking in. The service was great!,1
The room basically was clean| but I still found other human hairs in the clean towels.,1
Great stay. Clean| comfortable bed| quiet and safe area| easy to get on interstate for 15 min drive to the city. Friendly staff. Would for sure stay again. Large room. Free parking.,1
Nice and clean room .,1
Awesome stay. Staff was great. Very clean.  Free water and yummy free cookies made it even better free parking was a plus too.,1
Cold pool| fungus in room shower| Jacuzzi closed due to contamination from child urine.,1
Very nice hotel. Nice staff. Just a note that stores| restaurants off site| shopping would be a mile or more away. It seems located for several large corporations nearby. Something to consider for some travelers as outside food and beverage options are very limited unless you get a ride. There is a nice walking path along the water very close.,1
Very good good breakfast ckean|nice view free breakfast| good staff,1
It was amazing! Friendly and attentive staff.  Super clean| easy parking access. Would definitely stay here again...oh and the cookiesüòãü§ó,1
Great location| easy to get to.  Close to san francisco.,1
Wasn't there long enough but it was nice,1
Wonderful everything great | super easy to check in and out. No hustle,1
Prefect place to stay if coming Oakland Raiders game. Had a great stay.,1
cheap inside-out. loud. air too dry in a room. curtains too small| light gets in at night. all these details make it hard to rest at night. service is terrible| hard to get in touch with (via the phone or in person). does not worth the money. ops!,0
Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful.  Close to the airport but you can't heat the planes.    I would stay there again!,1
Nice view of the city a short walk away. Easy freeway access. Expensive| but a lot cheaper than being in the city.,1
It was a nice hotel a couple miles away from the city but it's a really nice hotel its worth staying there if you ask me,1
Beds seemed old| there was clanking when you would sit down. Overall nice though.,1
Great location to stay while visiting San Francisco! Rooms are spacious and comfortable! Highly recommend,1
Good location| short drive to downtown.  Very clean and nice hotel.,1
Best hotel in San Francisco for vacation if you want quiet and relax,1
Comfortable stay| very clean.The breakfast was satisfying. Dinner selection was pleasant. Overall very accommodating| no need to leave the premise.,1
Best stay ever!!! From the super friendly and courteous staff| to the beyond clean accommodations| and the amazingly comfortable bed I could absolutely live here! The indoor pool and hot tub was very clean and warm and the fitness center was a nice size with everything from machines to free weights| water and yoga mats. The in room dining has a nice variety as well. Overall i qould highly recommend this hotel to anyone.,1
Great location!Great Prices!Plenty of free parking.Made our 1st trip to SF excellent!,1
A good hotel| conveniently close to airport| but not far from SF tourist attractions.  The hotel was clean| but definitely gets used a lot and shows some wear.  The staff was friendly and competent.  I would not hesitate staying here again.,1
Nice hotel close enough to all the sites without breaking the wallet!! Loved it would definitely stay again!!,1
We were visiting family and didn't want to stay in SF (to many problems there now). This hotel is new| in great shape and very convenient to get to downtown SF and to visit with family. Even though it's very close to the freeway| it was quite . The staff was very friendly and helpful. Nice bar and restaurant .,1
Overall is good. The place is quiet. I don't see many people in this area. Parking is $15. However| the parking lot is not covered or patrolled. I am not a big fan of this. But it is fine.,1
Great staff! Easy check in and out. A bit hard to find if you drive there yourself. The room is clean!,1
employee very friendly and helpful,1
Great room with view to the bay.  Front desk service is quick and warm.  Bedding is very comfortable.,1
The room was just ok. The ceiling had visible patches from water damage| the bathroom door was pretty beat up| and the sink wouldn't drain. There were crumbs in the sofa bed| which we used for sleeping. The front desk staff was rude and incompetent- charging us for things we'd prepaid| giving me floor mats instead of bath towels that were still damp (our room wasn't adequately stocked with towels)| etc. I wouldn't stay here again.,0
Check in was super fast and friendly.  Shuttle service was quick and on time.  Rooms were very clean and comfortable.,1
My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay. We were satisfied w/the condition of the hotel. The breakfast was nice| but was a little disappointed that there was no fresh fruit| along w/other items| usually served for breakfast. We were definitely satisfied| and looking forward to staying there| again| soon.,1
The staff was very friendly and helpful.,1
Love this place,1
Housekeeping needs to step it up. Our whole bathroom had black mold that hasn't been scrubbed in awhile. Patio door hasn't been cleaned in a long while either. We enjoyed being by the airport and the inside lobby is really pretty,1
I flew in with my family via LA from Panama. I  reserved this hotel because I have had great experiences at other Embassy Suite locations. I saw they offered Airport Transfers| we landed at 11PM and come to find out their airport service stops at a certain time| for a hotel that is 1.5 miles from the airport they should continue to run this service| end result was paying for two cabs to get the the hotel and of course they charge the LA minimum. I checked in they give me a room without a frosted window where you cannot see anything| also had a strong smell of smoke. I do not recommend staying at this location if traveling with family or just needing a room to stay.,0
When we arrive to the hotel we asked a room on the fifth floor. The girl on front desk said ok but you have to wait like an hour in a half .We waited in a lobby more than hour in a half and then they said we are sorry but all rooms are busy on fifth floor.. Then they said they don't have a cleaning Service for every day. They can do just one time whitch they didn't do even one time for our five nights reservation.. Every day we had to go to the front desk and ask them  for towels.One day they even told us we are out of towels..Breakfast is not like it was before not even close.For some reason they told us before we booked the hotel that everything the same but its not..Laundry was broken all the time and we couldn't do the laundry too.And the worst what was happened the Elevator was stock one night and we got so scared to death..My family so disappointed about this hotel ..We definitely never ever come again ..,0
The bathrooms where old and mold was in between the tile of the shower. I asked to switch rooms| the other room was just as bad with the mold in between the tile of the showers,0
Rooms clean and comfortable. Staff friendly and helpful. Burger at the Bistro bar was delicious. Washing machines were a helpful amenity except only 1 washing machine was working.,1
The staff was friendly and helpful. Hotel was clean. Street parking is free. Just make sure to check signs,1
The Hotel is absolutely gorgeous.,1
It was a nice hotel but the pull out bed could of had nicer blankets . The blanket felt like something you would use for moving . I was pretty shocked and for the price we paid for one night 300.00,1
I have stayed at this property many times over the years.  This stay was much improved over my last stay.  Room was cleaner| appeared to have been refurbished since my last stay.  Security was improved.  Staff was welcoming and friendly.,1
It's old.,1
Facilities were nice but we arrived late and had to wait about 10 minutes for a staff member to come to the front desk to check us in.,1
I've stayed at this hotel prior n boy what a difference.  The hotel smelt so bad. A mix between pot and dirty socks.   The breakfast was disgusting and not cooked to order.  N yes I know there's a pandemic ........it's really run down and old..... the bathroom vanity panel was all busted up ...would def not recommend this  hotel.,0
I like the fact that is next to the airport I did not like that the pool is still closed and they charge to get a parking space inside the hotel.,1
It's a very nice hotel.,1
Stayed 2 nights was nice the breakfast was very good! Was happy to see they still served the breakfast also tried the dinner on site was very good as well! Over all enjoyed my stay and would stay again. The only negative thing I would say is the staff needs to answer the phone for incoming guests|that was very frustrating!,1
Property was so outdated| tubs were stained| walls were stained. No air filtration in the room. My kids had to sleep on the floor because the mattress on the sofa bed was so thin the rails were digging in their back. Bathroom was small| toilet did not flush upon arrival| had to call maintenance. Pool was closed| lobby smelled like a swamp. Balcony was so tiny. I just wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone. They need to destroy it and rebuild.,0
The view on the elevators,1
All was good. Didn't care for loud air conditioner and stuffiness at times but other than that it was ok.,1
Property are very nice quiet place to staff very friendly staff,1
Our stay was ok. It was clean enough for us to shower comfortably and it wasn't too far from the beach,1
The location and the staff,1
Staff was kind and very pleasant but the bad thing is you have to pay parking kinda feel like is ridiculous the price,1
The personnel were friendly and helpful.  Problem in the first room| shower did not work it was broken.  They switched us to another room. The bath shower area had mold but we did not report to the front desk.  We were too tired and just wanted to rest.,0
Overpaid for an outdated room. Elevators smelled like marijuana. Parking was way too expensive. Shuttle service not 24/7.,0
I chose this hotel because it said that it had airport to hotel transfers and breakfast included. When we got to the airport in LA| I called the hotel only to be told that they no longer offered them and to take a cab from the airport.  When I stated that that was the reason I chose the hotel through Hotels.com| the clerk told me ‚ÄúWell| the information is on our website.‚Äù  When you go through a third party to book| you don't go to the hotel's website.  I'm sure I am not the first person this happened to and probably not the last. Also| there was no breakfast available at the time we had to leave for the airport the next morning. We paid top dollar for an ‚Äúairport hotel‚Äù for 5 hours at a airport hotel without airport amenities!  We returned to Lax 1 week later for our return to Florida. This time we stayed the Lax Hampton that while not offering a shuttle| did pay for the cab/Lift to and from the airport. They also had on the go breakfast.,0
I was very disappointed| the water drain so slow in the shower| I was standing in a tub of water.  When I pulled out the sofa sleeper in the front| I saw GREEN MOLD on the bottom of the mattress.  Lastly| the sheets on one of the beds look like it had blood stains on it.  I will never stay there again.,0
Very clean And the breakfast was better than expected usually all the stays I've had at hotels during COVID didn't serve any hot breakfast but Embassy did. I enjoyed my stay we are regulars with  Embassy especially when we're doing family trips. The parking is $36 a night but there is parking on the street.,1
The service was great. The team was nice and responsive. Easy access to LAX and beach.,1
You can not look out windows. Window in bedroom frosted glass. This should be stated upfront,0
Everything was nast about this hotel from the overall look to the doors walls and toilet. The toilet screeched all night. The walls has holes abd was dirty. All the trash cans was overflowing. The doors didnt have locks the air conditioner was broke. The pool was broke abd dirty the lobby smelled like urine it was terrible never ever ever again.,0
The mini fridge did not work we booked a room with full balcony was given a room with tiny balcony,0
Very bad property| dirty rooms need updating| hotel needs updating| bad location,0
Hotel was great for a family stay.  I didnt realize the shuttle wasnt running (its located on embassys website| but that information did not get placed on the hotel.com website).  Otherwise| service and the site was great!!,1
Very comfortable and excellent services,1
I would love to frequent your hotel in my future across the world thank you and God Bless Each of you!,1
I loved how spacious the rooms are! However I did not like that there were no windows to see out of!,1
I would not recommend anyone go stay here. Highly disappointed at the amount of money I paid for my stay here,0
Stayed there for granite airport.  Never emailed in advance to let us know it no longer was a available. Room was old furniture| and small. Very disappointed,0
Stayed here several times over the years| but this is the first time I stayed without the buffet breakfast and no cleaning services for my room.,0
I did have an issue the restaurant needs to put a limit or watch how intoxicated a guest is. While waiting to purchase a meal| my daughter was being harassed by a Caucasian drunk woman. As I intervene I noticed she had too many alcoholic drinks in front of her. She started to harass me but I didn't stay quiet. As I yelled at her she quickly looked down and her husband told her to relax. I got my food and my daughter and i walked to our room but I was very upset.,1
When I walked in the building I killed a roach. Once we hot into our room there was a stuffy mildew smell. After examining the room there were dead bugs splattered on the wall and door. My family left immediately,0
I have stayed at this hotel many times| but this last stay was the worst. I understand certain things was because of COVID-19. No housekeeping| no complimentary breakfast and the service from staff wasn't available. The bathroom was dirty| and the water in the shower dripped all night. It was horrible for the price I paid.. They need to come down on their prices if you're not getting the service that included in the price. I felt robbed,0
Not so good| toilet was broken and ran all night,0
Big rooms| clean| spacious.  interesting hotel layout.  lots of good amenities when open.   they do have ceiling fans and underground parking is extra.  off street parking is free and sometimes available.  close to airports| and everything.,1
Beautiful lobby| cool to be able to watch the activity at the airport! Sucks the restaurant/bar was closed due to Covid| but lots of Door Dash options. Balcony was small and bathroom was a little outdated| but overall a good place to stay,1
Lovely place inside and rooms were very spacious and comfortable.,1
This is one of the friendliest nicest staff i have ever expirenced! Always a pleasure to stay at this hotel!,1
Excellent service ! definitely come back and stay again,1
We paid the same price for a room that you pay when there is full breakfast and cocktail reception. Disappointing,1
I hate that I select this hotel for my 3 day getaway. My bathroom ceiling leak| noisy hotel and the breakfast on the go was a brown paper bag with a fruit| muffin and package of instant oatmeal that you have to make yourself. Nothing to drink but a bottle of water. No shuttle and the parking is almost $40 a day to park.,0
Very friendly staff. Beautiful roooms. Such a calming peaceful hotel.,1
The elevator has a really bad odor.. The balcony was very small.,0
It's was a very nice room. I like that there was like a living room seperate from the bedroom. I didn't like that the TV didn't have Netflix or streaming apps. The internet also doesn't support anything like a Roku or Amazon Fire stick. I really wanted to catch up tv shows| but couldn't. Which was a big let down for me.,1
Customer service  was horrinle| dirty room |had to change rooms|,0
I clearly did not read the reviews before booking and boy what a mistake that was. This was by far the WORST Embassy Suites that we have ever stayed in. The lobby| elevator| and rooms had a terrible smell. My wife spent the first hour trying not to vomit while adjusting to it. You could also hear all conversations from the hallways and rooms next to you. On a positive note the staff was friendly and on street parking was easy to find.,0
Yuck! They are ridiculously overpriced for a tacky smelly old building with ZERO amenities! They have the balls to charge $40 for parking too! What a joke!!! This place gives all Embassy suites a bad name,0
The room was not so clean as it seemed. The restroom was dirty and the restroom door was broken it would get stuck when you closed the door and you would have to push on it hard to open it really disappointed,0
It was a great experience. I would definitely recommend to anyone.,1
Front desk service was fantastic| but the hotel was dark| room clean but outdated and needed painting| cabinets refreshed| etc. Also| no airport shuttle service while the sister hotel less then @2 -3 miles offered shuttle service. Get your act together| so you're still in business after all this noise-mask or no mask| providing fantastic service and overcoming obstacles is what's required to successfully survive this environment.,0
I understand this is covid19 pandemic however if your going to still reserve rooms they should at least be clean. Also I didn't get the room I reserved and nothing was available in the hotel horrible stay. The rooms are old and needs to be upgraded. No parking $36 to park insane. This is the worst embassy I have ever stayed at. Won't stay at this particular one ever again,0
Bathroom is super tiny and dirty corners in the bathroom| the refrigerator had a horrible smell in it The bedroom was not vacuumed properly| found an old sock next to the bed| We left our room came back and there was 2 bugs crawling on our bed GROSS! I will never stay here ever again,0
Big hotel nice room very convenient to airport,1
Needing a Receipt for my stay. Very good stay getting a room was easy and fast.,1
I never checked in because the pool was closed. Disappointed that I wasn't told at time of reservation,0
I didn't like that the pool was close but I understand the reasons why,1
I chose the hotel because it said free cook to order breakfast and an indoor pool. Upon arrival we were informed that they would hand out sack breakfasts and the pool was closed. I felt mislead and should've received a discount for the sack breakfast.,1
So on 4/15/2020 my wife and I decided to stay at Embassy suites for the very 1st time. I WILL DEFINITELY NOT BE RETURNING OR RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. I'm allergic to dust and when I checked into my room| I turned on the A/C and went to bed. 2 hrs later I woke up drenched in sweat| with red|swollen| itchy eyes due to my allergy reaction from the dust collected in heat vents. I looked at the A/C monitor saw that it read 65 degrees| confused but being the good person I am I| turned off the AC| opened a window and decided I'll just call in the morning about it.I called the front desk and explained the issue...Both the front manager and the General manager| were the most disrespectful and unprofessional managers that I have ever came across and shouldn't be working in the service industry. They offered me only a 20% discount stating it wasn't their fault and explained that the ax only has 3 set temperatures that u could put it on and the weather outside effects the temperature so if it's cold out it will turn heater on. Never have I ever heard something like this. I was never told this because if I was I wouldn't have stayed at this hotel. So if you like sleeping with the ac unit on don't stay at this hotel.,0
It was bad room had a weird smell and bee hive right above me,0
The bed service was excellent and all the staff was amazing... We had a great time and was treated with Love and Respect.,1
Not new but clean and kind| totally I like it and will return.,1
no expresso shop  should have coffee access in the lobby,1
I tried not to listen to all the bad reviews about this hotel but they were almost all true! Walking into the hotel the water fountain was dripping but we were greeted with a smile. The hotel room smelled like wet cigarettes. The bathroom had water damage. It's a completely outdated hotel. The balcony that gives a view of the city was tiny. There was no room for a chair. However| I loved the balcony that faced the inside of the hotel. The breakfast was awesome. This was my first experience at Embassy Suites.,0
The hotel is good for the price. I visited from Friday - Sunday in late February. The location is very close to the airport and to the freeway. So I was pleasantly surprised at how quiet the interior is. I ordered a fan because I typically need one so it may have blocked som if the outside noise however in the past I could still hear hallway noise if not outside doors. My biggest concern with the property is that my room was a little smelly and there is rust in areas of the bathroom. Overall for the price this hotel is a fair value for budget conscious travelers with a family.,1
We were returned to stay at this hotel because we love our last stay 2years ago.  However| At this time| the staff at the front desk was not helpful and friendly as before.  Wendy makes me feel like I bother her.  She talked like robot.  The room wasn't ready when we check-in.  It was around 3:30 pm. She said it's wait time around 20 min.  I told her I don't' want to wait I can take any room.  She said I have to pay extra if I changed room type.  I refused to pay so we wait.  However| it took longer than 20 min.  Until passed 20 min.  Wendy left and someone else helped me. When we entered the room.  The carpet was not clean and it's so sticky. we need to wear shoes in the room.  I found the gum next to the chair.   We were in room 106.  My husband doesn't' move because we were so tired because of travel back to Boston the next day.  Room cleanliness was very disappointed.  No complimentary water for HHonors.   Only 2 things I like there are the manager reception staff and a van driver were so nice.   Check out staff didn't ask my stay at all and I don't' want to tell because it's her job to ask the guest.   I don't' think I will go back there again.,0
I love the hole hotel . I was just disappointed they took the  hot tub out  and the food wasn't as  it use to be.. but other then that it's a great hotel,1
We had to be moved because our first room was completely dirty!  We did not sleep at all because the second room felt just as dirty! I am extremely disappointed and will not be trusting Expedia for rooms again!,0
There was too many people in the pool and the tile in the shower had mildew.,1
We stay at a lot of Embassy Suites and I have to say I found this one architecturally my favorite it is a beautiful hotel. The employees here are very friendly and helpful. The manager's even reception was good the bar tenders were very friendly and like to talk they made you feel like your at home. We had dinner in the restaurant I had the New York steak it was delicious cooked to perfection my husband had the turkey sandwich which was great. I would highly recommend this hotel.,1
Great team.. very accommodating and patient with my special requests.  Overal great service,1
Rooms really spacious and clean and my husband love the breakfast... üëç,1
Very comfortable| great staff| close to airport| nice breakfast!!! All great!!! See you again!!!,1
Proximity to the airport was a plus! The hotel is clean and comfortable! Room is spacious!,1
Was a good stay at this hotel but we had some problem with the shuttle in the arrival,1
I thought this location had a Jacuzzi. I was really looking forward to it,1
We ordered food and the kid's meal they sent was completely cold. We had to wait on that| and the meal for two adults and a kid was $90. The food should be fresh. They replaced it| but we were finished eating by the time it came back. We had to call the restaurant 4-5 times and the front desk several times to get this resolved. That was very frustrating with a hungry child. The indoor pool was nice| that was a highlight.,1
Beautiful atmosphere and gorgeous atrium. Very generous with their complimentary evening reception and breakfast. We had supper in their restaurant and the food was very tasty and the wait staff were very friendly.,1
Hot water was out.  Staff was a little less than friendly about the situation.,0
Very nice stay| except when we arrived there was only one working elevator and it took 10 minutes to even get on it and get up to our room. Otherwise the facilities and services were excellent.,1
We have stayed at this hotel before for a morning flight out. It is a very nice hotel! Has a crib for our daughter| big room| free breakfast and free drinks and snacks during a certain time at night. The shuttle is great and got us to the airport on time! Will stay at this hotel every time we are in LA flying out in the morning!,1
The hotel shuttle schedule and service was great. Did not like the condition of the room. Room is old and the bathroom door had a hard time closing correctly.,0
No hot water in the room| I called the front desk and was told| ‚Äúit takes a few minutes to warm| it's not instant‚Äù.. so after about 15 minutes and a call back to the front desk we ran out of time for our entire party to shower.. Ooh| the biggest issue- Don't let the ‚Äúfree shuttle service to airport‚Äù lure you in. What they don't tell you is they have two shuttles| maybe 20 passengers each| and they are both full with an ‚ÄúI'm sorry| wait for the next shuttle in half hour‚Äù as your parting gift. We ended up taking an Uber.,0
The hotel is very clean | the breakfast buffet it's very good| the social hour with free alcohol  drinks and snacks it's very good . The staff very helpful and friendly. There is also a gym to use . The whole stay was very good and will be staying there again when I comeback to Los Angeles!,1
Room 110 smelled like Mildew and floor was damp room 108 when you take a shower water shoots out the back the shower head if u move it to any other position.,0
Our recent stay was poor.  The toilet was inoperable. We contacted maintenance and he came| pulled apart the toilet and said we may need a new toilet and then left.  After an hour| we went to the front desk to inquire| and he told us the maintenance man said he left because someone was taking a shower.  No one was taking a shower.  Our son was sitting in the living room with his girlfriend.  They then said he man would be right back.  He fixed the toilet and left.  He left the floor dirty| and left our bath mat wet| and filthy.  The temperature control is unacceptable in that there is no way to cool the room .  They have no air conditioning during this time of year.  It became so warm and stuffy that my husband's glasses steamed up.  ( humorous... but not) We had our 9lb dog with us and were told originally that there would be a $35 pet deposit| only to find out that they charged us $40 PER NIGHT. We called housekeeping and asked for 2 pillows and 4 towels.  They brought us 2 pillows only.  When we called back | they told us they would bring the 4 towels.  They then brought us 2 towels and 2 blankets?? We have used this hotel for years for both ourselves| as well as family when they came to visit.  After the last 2 visits|  we will be looking for another hotel.,0
Our room ac did not work| smelled really bad | carpet had a leak coming from the handicap room . Tried several times to contact reception | no answe. No water in room to drink either. Worth stay ever.,0
All of the employees| with the exception of one front desk person who seemed a bit tense| were very friendly and helpful. The 2 shuttle drivers I encountered were very polite and personable. I didn't receive my bag of complimentary waters for being a rewards member| but did very much appreciate the breakfast each morning.  Big Pros to keep: shuttle service|  free breakfast| evening reception Con: overpriced restaurant and no other food options,1
Good for an overnight stay by the airport.,1
Very nice stay.Reasonable price. Kids friendly.Happy hour every day!We'll be back!,1
Very convenient to LAX....great place for a stopover.  Maria ar the Managers Reception was delightful.  Mucho Gracias,1
Great place I liked it very much very clean close to airpprt,1
The secure parking with a guard was most enjoyable!The Embassy suites was just as I expected from name:),1
I think $40/night parking fee exorbitant ‚òπÔ∏è,1
Great property with pleasing architectural character. Spotlessly clean| spacious room. The staff are very professional. Maria makes delicious mixed drinks at the evening reception bar! My only complaint is it's in a very odd setting - reminded me of a high school cafeteria. Not really suitable to relax and mingle with other guests.,1
it wasn't very pleasant for biz stays| first i was assigned the ground floor unit that was outdated and first room was with strange smell| but reassigned room again the same row few doors away. Furniture looks old and quite an unpleasant experience,0
Room late check in at 3:00 the room is not ready until 4:00 plus give to mi a handicap room because supposed no more room available house keeping no due beds one day and no mop the floor just take garbage out,0
Great hotel. Clean comfortable Great customer service and great early and service shuttle to the airport.,1
Breakfast was the best part of stay. Checkin was horrible experience the person who checked us in was rude and said we had not paid when we already had. The room was dirty mildew in the bathroom refrigerator leaked water everywhere. Would not stay at this hotel again,0
After a long trip| it was nice to have a happy hour included! Comfortable rooms| convenient to airport| regular 24 hour shuttle service and a great breakfast.,1
The room was clean and efficiently well appointed.  The staff was cordial and professional.  The evening reception had made to order drinks and the usual comfort food choices such as nachos| popcorn & pretzels.  The morning breakfast was outstanding.  In addition to a buffet of traditional breakfast foods| they offered made to order omelettes as well as a variety of nutritional fruits.  The shuttle to the airport was prompt and the driver was very courteous.  We will definitely stay there again when we have to fly out of LAX.,1
Unfortunately this is a very hot property. The room would not cool down past 72 degrees and quite a bit humidity. While some people can handle that| I need the room a bit cooler. They even brought Maintenace in| but they could not fix the air. It's an older building with a different air system. If you need a cool room| avoid at all cost.,0
Wished I could've enjoyed more of the amenities| but I did get to enjoy the buffet. Loved the lay out of the suite.,1
Overall appearance and quality was great but didn't have a jacuzzi by the pool.,1
Hotel room was run down. Paint was peeling off the walls| tiles were brown and cracked in the bathroom|  air conditiomer was old| noisy| and didn't work well. The in-room refrigerator wasn't cold and the chain on the ceiling fan lamp broke off| and staff couldn't fix it during my stay. Overall very diappointed in the quality of the hotel room.,0
Staff were lovely and loved the complimentary drinks and snacks in the evening| also thought the breakfast selection was good. Very happy with our stay,1
Hotel had booked wedding and birthday celebration on some night. Hotel did not inform me when checking in of events scheduled. Wedding event was right outside my room. There was a no host bar and a three piece live band that was loud. The event was scheduled until midnight. Hotel offed to move us but same area different floor. Could not sly. The heat was not working. The hotel gave us space heaters. The mattress on the bed was saggy and lumpy.  The stay was not y.,0
Beautiful hotel with everything we needed!,1
Very good choice for the price. Great location: safe| close to beaches and air port.,1
Nice and patient staff. Clean rooms and bathrooms.,1
Close to the airport| nice shuttle| great breakfast| comfortable room and bed.,1
Liked the proximity to the airport| shuttle bus (free)| buffet breakfast and the quirky interior layout/design.Our suite was a bit tired.,1
The open terrace is inviting. The complimentary 5:30 happy hour was very nice. Great way to relax at the end of the day. Also a nice breakfast today start the day. Rooms are spacious and clean with friendly staff. On-site restaurant serves quality food. Looking forward to staying here again.,1
Only issue the room door wouldn't close. Other than that had a nice stay,1
"This hotel was awful! Customer service didn't exist.  When we arrived| we were convinced to upgrade to a beautiful suite with a balcony and a view for only $25 extra per night. Well|  the balcony was a barred in ledge. The phone didn't work. The wifi wasn't included. The pool had things floating on the top of the water. I complained to the general manager of the location and he actually told me that his hotel was not for vacationing|  rather more for business in and out meetings. He also told me that the word ""balcony"" may have different meanings| and his was not truly a balcony to sit on. The ""beautiful"" view from our room was of the airport and the kicker was when I finally went to bed the room shook everytime a plane took off. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!",0
It was a wonderful experience as usual| but some of the rooms are out dated... could use a revamp! But it's is a beautiful and relaxing atmosphere.,1
All good. Very grateful to be able to book day trips from the hotel as we returned hire car early. Lovely staff| great reception at front desk.Maybe more variety from restaurant.,1
Poor service and room not clean.  Had to waite half an hour to get a shaving kit.  room is not very clean,0
Had a lovely stay me and family.food was excellent,1
Spacious rooms| nice design. We loved that there are two rooms and fridge/microwave. Breakfast was great.,1
The property was nice but i didnt like the fact that we had to get up at 3am to change to another room because water was leaking inside the room i was in and once i checked out the room i ask them how was they gonna compensate me for the inconvenience they caused nd their response was since i didnt book the room straight from their website i have to deal with Expedia since i booked from there,0
Stayed here for our connection to Japan.  This hotel is exactly as it is pictured.  So beautiful on the outside and inside.  My only complaint is the shuttle time service| otherwise it was very nice that the driver offered us water| especially after a long flight.  The hotel is very clean and the breakfast is one of the best I've had with a good variety and a made to request grill.  The pool is beautiful even though we didn't get to use it and the little outside garden is cute.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS LOCATION.,1
The property is very close to the airport and provides a great shuttle-the very reason we decided to stay there. However| the room was damp| there were spots of moisture on the ceiling| the property was overpriced ($200+ per night) for the lack of The room layout was strange. The rooms with the bathroom with an extra sink were in one room| which made it difficult to shower while the baby slept in the same room. This is not the typical set up of the Embassy Suites we have stayed in. Where the room with an external sink we're in one room and the bathroom was in the next. We requested via email and was confirmed to have a crib. The crib was not ready upon arrival but were promised we would have one. Two hours later - nothing. 3 hours later- nothing. It was 9pm and 4 requests later until we received it. The price did not match the We will not stay there again.,0
Everything needed was within the Hotel. Staff was friendly and helpful.,1
"We booked this hotel| because their proximity to LAX and shuttle service. We ended up waiting more than one hour for the shuttle and we're lied to by the hotel about when it's going arrive and when it left the hotel several times.Check-in efficient| but unfriendly. Hotel room toilet wasn't cleaned properly| backsplash on the cover.Hotel hallway was filthy with a big stain of what liked like vomit| but was a very sticky mass. No effort to clean that or to at least cover it up. People stepped into it one after another.Telephone in the room didn't work.The list goes on... not even so much as an ""I'm sorry"" from the front desk. QGreat shuttle drivers| baggage handlers and security personnel though.",0
There is a huge inside courtyard that is a nice touch when walking through the hotel. There's complementary hot breakfast as well as complementary cocktail hour with a few snacks an open bar. They have an indoor pool strong with chlorine no ventilation no Jacuzzi but at least they have a pool. It was too busy when we went.,1
Enjoyed the space in the suite.  Plenty of room. GConvinient loscation,1
Complimentary reception was awesome .,1
Very impressive lobby| decor. Good food. Nice rooms.,1
Great location in relation to LAX....wonderful amenities| and the service was impeccable! I will be making this my hotel of choice when traveling to LA going forward.,1
Great hotel near the beach.,1
had an excessive amount of bags due to a relocation and left an item behind and 12 days later have not  been contacted back. very unfortunate!,1
Overall stay was Ok; however| we had problem with our reservation from the start. I called on a day of check in and they could not find my reservation| I called Expedia representative could not find it either. It was nerve racking 40 min.. When we finally checked in| the bedding for the couch was missing| i called the front desk twice and then went there for the sheets to be delivered to our room. Also| about guess laundry| they only have 2 washers and 2 dryers and washer didnt work for the first 3 days of our stay| really inconvenient with kids. Breakfast was delicious!!! Staff was friendly and helpful! Social hour was great as well!!!,1
Front desk was not engaging or friendly upon checking on a Sunday afternoon,1
The hot  breafast and variety.  They also have the order to cook.,1
Dirty bathrooms| old hotel| needs desperate updating,0
Good service//////////////////////////////////:::::::,1
Close to airport| Los Angeles| yet remote location in its own way.,1
It was an amazing hotel. But| the $35 a night parking was a little excessive.. When you figure an advertisement of $169 rooms is really over $200. Just saying.,1
Very old rooms and washrooms. Bad pool area. Lobby ok,0
Love the layout of the hotel with the courtyard. Has a nice homey feeling.,1
Everything is Clean except the pool area| in my opinion water needs to be changed,1
The reception and breakfast is the best.   It almost made it worth putting up with the dated room but not quite.  The most important thing to me is the sleeping quarters.  The king bed was worn out and sloping a bit downward so our head was a little lower than our feet!   The pillows were old| lumpy and thin.   I think there was one decent one in the bunch of extra pillows I requested to try and solve the problem.    It never ceases to amaze me when hotels don't replace their pillows!! It's such an inexpensive upgrade!   Our girls were so looking forward to the indoor pool but returned quickly reporting that it was cloudy and so gross in there.   I was pretty disappointed with our stay.  I thought all Embassy Suites were great| but this stay has definitely changed my mind.,0
Our stay with my family was wonderful! Loved the upscale breakfast! Definitely will stay again!,1
Embassy suites is my go to hotel.,1
Loved the old traditional look and feel of the facility. This location is well maintained.  Do not make any changes to the layout and design!,1
Excellent service| staff and efficient location for air travelers,1
The room smelled| window needs to be opened during the night (which is not acceptable). You hear airplanes at 3 a.m.| too.,0
This room had the familiar Embassy Suites layout and all was in place.  We were only there for a very short stay so weren't impacted by some of the services that were being worked on.  The lobby is very pretty and spacious.,1
Great stay for me and my family the kids love it,1
The rooms were ok. When you walk it had an odor to it. But other than that it was ok,1
It is kind of old looking| we had a bad experience with noisy guests upstairs,0
Property is big and nice. The breakfast was awesome and staff friendly. Would go back,1
The property itself is nice and the even reception was good. However| Parking is $35 per night| this is ridiculous,1
Managers reception was excellent. Fitness center was under renovation,1
Awesome hotel overall. Staff very friendly. Bartender Maria made us feel welcomed during the manager's lounge.,1
Clean rooms comfortable stay and excellent customer service,1
Maria in the kitchen is fantastic| also Rose and one in the bar,1
This hotel was one of the best hotels I stayed at.  Loved how I can step out on the balcony and smoke in a CA hotel.  Free breakfast served every morning.  The staff was friendly and great!,1
The bathroom curtains would not hold the shower water. It would flood to the floor.,1
Pleasant and helpful staff. Clean and unique surroundings.,1
Great place to stay! Staff were awesome and helpful. If wanting to venture out it is abit from from places but delt with it as very close to airport. Would definately stay again!,1
Nice breakfast| great staff!  The proximity to the airport is less than 1 mile.,1
Things I didn't like... mold on the ceiling| exposed rust on the bathroom door frame. Going to my car first thing in the morning and the entire thing smelling like weed. The parking garage was the place to get contact high. Things I liked... staff was happy. Beds were clean and comfy. Security was friendly. Other stayers were polite. Would I stay here again... yes... provided my $$/night matches the room I'm in.,1
The beds were very small. They were full size not Queen beds as i requested. 2 of the elevator broke while we were there. The breakfast was great. In fairness i would give the complete stay a 6.5. The hotel needs a facelift.  Its kinda old and musty the pool was also outdated.  The staff was great thats the only thing that made it better.,1
AMAZING HOTEL! We found and booked this hotel last minute as a change from one we already had booked and checked into and were not pleased with. I was taken back by the resort feel this hotel had. The rooms were so big and clean. We booked 2 rooms but could have easily stayed in 1 with all the extra space. The free breakfast was a bonus and delicious. The bar/restaurant we ate at had the best chicken quesadillas I have ever had| and our waiter was so quick and friendly.  I will definitely be staying here again on my next LA vacation.,1
We had a great stay the people were extremely nice and helpful.  I would definitely come back and recommend.,1
Everything was resplendent. The minor details provoked major,1
Clean room.  Service just as we expected from Embassy Suites.  Nice to find a Tesla Destination Charger available in the parking garage.  Only complaint: $35/night for parking seems VERY steep| relatively far from the airport.,1
Everything was so clean and the staff was so great and helpful,1
Great hotel and staff.  Best breakfast ever at a hotel!,1
Bathroom was dirty and false advertisement.... no jacuzzi,0
The breafast was good bed was very nice|the tv was nice,1
Fantastic hotel in every way. Great service and facilities,1
I did not expect to see this type of place| very impressed with the condion of the room size| and all the amenities im it. Very good environment|  good breakfast| the garden area very clean and the staff very well trained.,1
Beautiful hotel.. love the restaurant..  complementary breakfast was very good.. my only problem I had was the maid came twice to my room.. The 2 days I was there I noticed dust on the furniture when I arrived..  when I left on the 3rd day it was still there.. all in all I Definitely would stay there again.,1
Very old facility needs a makeover badly the sink in room did not work the shower drained slow and neither phone in room worked to call the front desk,0
We came to town a day early to enjoy a bit of vacation before my husband's business trip started. This hotel was soooo wonderful that I'm seriously thinking about booking it again for the last night of our trip! You walk into pure and blissful luxury. The restaurant is wonderful. The staff are not only helpful but personable too. And| the cook to order breakfast was just magnificent. Add to that the outdoor terrace and free alcoholic beverages from 5:30-7:30pm| and this place just can't be beat!,1
There was nothing we didn't enjoy. It was excellent.,1
Hotel is in a convenient location 5 min from LAX. The property was clean and the room was spotless.,1
Easy check in and out. Love the amenities. Parking is expensive but you and find some parking along the street.,1
These rooms need to be upgraded for what they are charging.  I'd do better staying at the Sofitel hotel  for this price. Smh,0
If you've never stayed here| there is a central atrium that all rooms abut.  On my stay there was an extremely loud party that made the atrium| the pool| and our room uninhabitable.  The front desk couldn't seem to do anything to stop the noise.,0
Customer service and good location to airlines and other surroundings areas,1
Felt totally safe.  Beautiful setting. Available underground paid parking| but also street parking available for free.  Shuttle took us to airport at 4:30 a.m.,1
It was okay for the price that is more than expected. Also| I don't like hidden fees. The online total is different than when you get there.,1
Beautiful Hotel grounds. Room was big and clean with a seperate living room area.,1
It was a great location for the family. Close to the airport when we arrived and close to the beaches. Great location| service and great value.,1
The breakfast was delightful. The parking fee per night is outrageous and would cause me not to ever stay there again.,1
Close to airport but not worth the price. Expensive| stuffy|,0
The hotel is close to the airport.  The rooms are a little tired| but clean.  The breakfast and happy hour were excellent.,1
What a great place to stay for over night parking for vacations. I found this hotel only because the other local hotels were fully booked. I'm glad they were because this location was so easy to stay the night at and leave my Jeep for the week while flying out of LAX. The room was big and parking was very easy thanks to the easy to locate parking structure under the hotel and free LAX shuttle service. The shuttle was only 5 minute drive to LAX with traffic. Highly recommend this location to anyone looking for a place to stay the night and beat the LA traffic before a flight.,1
Just a beautiful place . Everyone was so nice and helpful,1
Complementary breakfast and happy hour| friendly staff| room service,1
The lobby looks great! Breakfast is good. The rooms need remodeling,1
This hotel was beautiful| clean and comfortable. The lobby was huge and so was the king bed room we booked. The room had a living room and a bedroom separated by a locking door. The bathroom was small but very clean. I would definitely stay here again!,1
The staff was amazing!! Helped us out with early check in| then let us have a late check out. The restaurant was fantastic| great food and drink options| at a reasonable price. We would definitely stay here again.,1
Free breakfast and nice staff. Nice to also have free parking too.,1
The listing specified it was a 2bdrm suite along with the pictures which when we walked in our room it was a one bedroom suite with two beds in it and a sofa bed which was very uncomfortable the stay was good but the sleeping comfort was not. It was not enough space for 4 adults and two children,1
I stayed at the property for the heated pool. The only issue that occurred was kids with no adult supervision| they were  being loud and upnoxiuos.,1
Love this embassy suites- a bit far from universal studios but beautiful clean and can't beat their free breakfast,1
I love the ambiance| compliment drinks| indoor pool and great breakfast.,1
Everything was great. Icing on the cake was free parking on the street which was mentioned by awesome staff member. Save $31.per night. Thanks,1
Enjoyed the breakfast and ample space of the room.,1
The hotel was great. It was 6 of us total and the room was perfect for us all. Breakfast and pool were awesome as well.,1
Proximity to LAX. Far enough but close enough to LA Live,1
The place is great. Very convenient to the airport and is fun for the kids. Poo is fun but as it is indoor the wear and year is evident. Also the bathroom had steam or water damage so it was a little dingy. Breakfast was great but I wish the head more vegan options. The staff was very friendly. Everyone smiled and said hello.,1
Room was cleaned daily| and the breakfast was awesome. Also enjoyed the evening snacks and drinks that were offered.,1
I really enjoyed this hotel. The staff was really nice and informative.,1
The entire stay from Sharon at check in to the maid service plus the breakfast. This was our second stay there and we recommend it to anyone we know going to LA.,1
Nice hotel| staff was nice. They only thing I would say is the parking garage is low ceiling so if your drive a larger truck you may have problems.,1
The service was great I'm well satisfied with the service the bed was not so great I think they might have to replace the mattress is in my room,1
The receptionist was not very personable. I didn't really feel welcome at this hotel. The customer service could improve.,1
Over priced parking and dirty showers and the breakfast was terrible,0
Nothing about the property we liked. All the amenities were closed or broken.  The prices were ridiculously high and the staff was very rude .,0
We had a very disappointing stay at this property.  LA was really cold the days we were there.  I called the front desk on our first night because the heat didn't seem to be working.  The person who answered told me the heat would not come on until 1am.  I was offered a space heater and extra blankets.  The security guard brought up the items -- carrying the 'clean' blankets against his outdoor coat.  The room was older and had peeling wallpaper.  The nightstand was sticky from the previous guests.  I definitely would not stay here again.,0
Visually comforting . Comfortable surroundings. Friendly staff.,1
I was so looking forward to using the indoor pool and hot tub| BUT there was a terrible smell that did not smell like chlorine coming from the entire pool area.  The smell was so strong couldn't even enjoy sitting in the area.  The out door garden area was very relaxing.,1
A beautiful hotel and the food was great! The service was excellent and the staff was very friendly and accommodating! Will definitely be coming back.,1
Convenient to the airport for short overnights. Nice area for a walk. Pretty old murals and lobby. Was surprised with complimentary cocktails and snacks but charged for wifi.,1
Amazing and wonderful customer service from front desk to restaurant. Will come back again,1
The garden feature throughout the hotel is wonderful.,1
This is our second time here and we absolutely love it! We will be back again!,1
SHARON AT THE FRONT DESK| IRMA AND HOUSEKEEPING DID A WONDERFUL JOB OF MAKING THIS A VERY PLEASANT STAY.,1
Heating / cooling set to default: start heating at 55F and cooling at 70F. Had to use 3 layers to keep me warm during the night.,0
They charge $31 for parking per night!! Uggghhh,1
Room are clean and provide very good breakfast selection.,1
We enjoyed our stay at this hotel.  The property was clean and very accommodating.  We would stay here again.,1
Cost effective| great location| cleanliness of rooms could improve,1
Dated heating and cooling system means that you will freeze your tail off in your room until 9p if the weather outside does not match their setting. Other than that...good stay.,1
I was very disappointed in our suite. It was outdated and rundown. Shower tiles were dirty| bathroom door hinges rusted| bathroom ceiling stained| furniture all scratched up and old. Room had a stagnant smell to it. This property needs a complete overhaul.,0
My family enjoyed the hotel breakfast and indoor swimming pool very much.  The hotel has underground parking but cost $30/night.  We did not use it and can find street parking right out side the hotel.  The area is seem very safe and we had park our car on the street for the three nights  and has no problem find the parking.  But just need to watch the street sight because they wash the street twice a week.  We enjoy very much with this hotel location| clean room| friendly staff and great value.  We will come back again if we are in LA area again.,1
I stay at this hotel often.  This is the first time I've had an issue. I requested a certain room because I have OCD. Upon check-in I was told the room wasn't ready wasn't ready. I waited 1 1/2 hrs then told it was occupied. I rev'd an upgrade. New room was ice cold and so was the weather. I was told the system changes from hot to cold around 10 p.m. at 11 p.m. The air system was blowing cold with thermostat at 74 degrees. I called front desk at least 4 times. Each time someone showed up to the room with a portable heater| so I ended up with 4 heaters. No manager came upstairs no manager called. I asked to speak with the manager I was left on hold twice and hung up. I didn't go downstairs I was just too exhausted from my trip. I didn't get much rest because I didn't feel safe sleeping with portable heaters on| and having the heaters on for an extended period. Of time they begin to make crazy noises| so I had to get up cut them off wait a few minutes turn them back on. Last time I called downstairs about changing my room I was told the hotel was at capacity. I requested a manager call me back but that did not happen. This was the first issue I really had at this hotel but for me it was a big one. After all it was New Year's Eve.,0
Beautiful lobby like resort hotel| warm welcome from all staff. Food and room was top level service.,1
Quick stop over at LAX.  Close to the airport| free breakfast| free shuttle,1
Nice and relaxing,1
Staff is nice. Breakfast was meh. Could hear a lot of road traffic from the bedroom and noise from people on the front suite due to the open atrium. Sleeping in was not an option. Would stay here again| but would request a different room location.,1
Everything was fine. Nothing stood out but nothing was bad either. It's the location to LAX that is so convenient and is the reason why we chose Embassy Suites South.,1
Close to the airport without the noise typically associated with similar properties. It had a neighborhood feel. Only issue was the room temperature.,1
Very nice facility; the complimentary breakfast was the best. I'm looking forward to staying again.,1
Wet carpet!!!! Room smelled wet from the wet carpet.,0
Really nice hotel very close to the airport.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Breakfast had a lot of options and plenty of food even if you got there close to the end of breakfast.  The snack few hours were great! Perfect snack time when my kids started to get hungry again.  Overall a great hotel.  We would stay there again!,1
Spacious comfortable room| super breakfast and perfect location for a stop over having flown in from London. Only tip would be to make sure you get the ‚ÄòSouth' free shuttle bus from LAX to this hotel as this was not mentioned when we got on the shuttle or on the phone and we ended up at the wrong Embassy Suite Hotel...! Had to then Uber it to the correct location - not ideal after an 11hr flight and very tired!  Would def book again though and obviously get the right shuttle next time :),1
Great location for Los Angeles airport| courtesy airport shuttle. Friendly staff| great happy hour evening reception.,1
Excellent place| convenient location to airport| excellent breakfast with a lot of different choices| complementary snacks and drinks| super friendly stuff and service. if I ever go back to LA this is the place I'm staying,1
Tv programming was offered but offline. Could not use on demand,0
Clean & the shuttle worked out great.,1
I had been to many other embassy suites| I did not feel this as an upscale one. Units are old| carpets looks shabby. The worst thing was they charged for parking which is like $30 per day for two days to a totoal if 60. Car daily rental is only 30 and parking is again 30| that is very expensive. I will not stary here again.,0
Delicious cooked to order breakfast| friendly staff| will be back anytime we have an early LAX flight.,1
This is my second time at this hotel and has always been my favorite. Beautiful place| staff great and always very helpful (shout out to Edgar| Wendy| Jose for superb customer service).,1
We used this property to spend the night after our trip return from Europe. We didn't want to fight the LA traffic. They have a clean shuttle bus to pick you up from the airport. We enjoyed the happy hour. Next morning had our choice of cooked to order omelet and after breakfast we went home. Embassy Suites always a great place to stay| including this property.,1
The hotel was clean and close to the airport. All of the staff was very friendly and helpful.,1
Clean good service great experience   Would stay again.,1
Everything was great| room was clean| breakfast was excellent| staff was helpful.,1
Awesome experience! Definitely thinking of staying again.,1
Great hotel for a layover| nice breakfast| good staff| etc.,1
We have stayed here a few times on our way home to Australia. We love ‚ù§Ô∏è it| being close to the airport we catch the shuttle and we are at the terminal in 10minutes.Plus the hotel is like an oasis in the middle of chaos of L.A.,1
Location of the room was right next to the trash dump so it was noisy in the morning but fortunately I had an early morning so it wasn't too bad.,1
We were happy here| we did get assigned a low level room| which was fine| but ground noise just outside the window was a bit difficult with our small children. We were also just a bit concerned that the window literally faced the driveway to the hotel. The room was well maintained and stocked and we were overall very happy.,1
Every thing exceeded our expectation .,1
This was the nicest empbassy suite I have experienced.,1
Staff was very gracious and helpful.  Made-to-order breakfast always very good.  Evening Reception is nice for a quick drink and snack.Have stayed here twice and both times thoroughly enjoyed it.,1
My only complaint is paying $30 a day for parking at a hotel you PAID to stay in. When I made the complaint to the person at the desk they discounted it %50. I'm happy they discounted it but the hustle isn't customer friendly in my opinion. Other than that| very nice place to stay.,1
From first day to that last this place was amazing! Parking can be difficult but otherwise it's was great. Will definitely stay here again.,1
Everything was great| except for one thing.  The music from the wedding was quite load and went on later than expected.  Midnight seems to be an unreasonable time limit for that type of activity.  Would suggest better soundproofing or limit to 10pm.,1
Shower knob was broken. Entire of hotel is getting old and need some maintenance. We stayed at secound floor close to cafeteria. The music and noise of party at night bothered us.,0
Very convenient to Los Angeles International Airport,1
The most awesome breakfast and staff that knows how to serve you. For the evening you can sit at the bar in the open atrium and again great service.,1
The room was great| bathroom was clean| and the bed was cozy. The outside hallway with the large view of the entire lobby and dining room were amazing. And they serve free breakfast every morning. But the only small problem they did not provide are basically the free Disneyland shuttles. Probably because the hotel itself is located a little further south and on the other side of the freeway outside from the Disneyland resort. Other than that| the stay there was terrific.,1
Front desk is easily accessible. Quick check in .Less than 5mins.,1
Waited on elevators for 40mins| the cleaning staff got on the elevator before guests| everything looks shabby and beat. The coffee maker was dirty where you put the water. The door to the room didn't close properly.,0
Our family kept saying over & over how nice the room was! Very comfortable| spacious| cozy| etc....highly recommend for a family vaca stay!!,1
Great spacious room that we had on the 6th floor. Clean and the breakfast is what you expect. Parking cost about $30 per night.,1
I would stay again,1
The hotel was clean and neat. When you walk in you can tell it's a nice place to stay. The rooms was fresh and clean and made the stay relaxing.,1
Embassy Suites always deliver| great breakfast and nice to see the happy hour back. Only bad thing was $26 a day to park was not listed in original booking.,1
Check-in was a breeze.  Lobby and entrance was pretty grand.  Elevators seemed old. Popcorn ceilings| a little dated but overall was a comfy stay.  I can see why people would write bad reviews about this place but it's not THAT bad. Certainly better than most hotels and motels. The room they gave us slightly smelled like cigarettes| plugs in the bathroom didn't work| phone in the living room didn't work| felt a little muggy. I just called front desk to be moved to another room and they did no problem.  Our other room we had no complaints.  The staff was pretty helpful.Tried to access my email at their business center to print something but they still used internet explorer and it had some sort of restricted access. What's the point of a business center if the computers won't even let you access your email?  I just sent my documents I needed to print to the company email and they printed it for me.  At least they can do that.,1
Payed for a double and got a single love having guest sleep on the floor,0
Its 2021 and the best TV service/remote you could provide was THE SLOWEST moving channel changing access since 1975?  Come on| upgrade your service there... And the Angels game wasn't part of the TV package?  Angels play literally right across the street... really?  Bush league at best there...,1
Came for an Angels game. It was close enough to walk!  Wish the bar had stayed open later. We were looking forward to a celebration drink after the ‚Äúwin‚Äù and it was already closed. We were disappointed.,1
Great place to stay with family. Close to Disneyland| good restaurants| 1hour from Universal Studios Hollywood.,1
Complementary drinks in the evening and great breakfast in the morning.,1
Unless things change do not waste your money. Our stay was awful. The elevator was broke our whole stay so we had to pile in the service elevator with no AC and 15 other people and we had to wait 30 minutes at a time just to use it. The staff had no answer's when the elevators would be fixed. We stayed on the 10th floor there is no AC up there and it was horribly hot. The rooms AC was barely working so we had some hot nights of sleeping. The breakfast was nice but over at 9! So no sleeping in on vacation if you want to eat. The parking! After getting back from Disneyland... there was none! And u had to pay for it to go park in another parking lot that wasnt the hotels then wake up at 6 to move your car so you dont get towed. It says they had room service they don't none of the phone system worked in the hotel so you couldn't call for towels call for anything. We had to track people down just to find extra toilet paper. We payed more to get that peice of mind of a better place to stay .. total rip off! And the front desk staff could care less!!,0
Had to pay extra for parking....not cool,1
Certain staff members were friendly and accommodating and tried to make things right.,1
The hotel was very clean the breakfast was above and beyond exceptional. However the elevators in this place kept going out of order. We had to use the service elevator most of the weekend. We also book two queen beds and were given a king and pull out bed.,1
1 of 2 of the elevators did not work the entire stay. 2 of 2 elevator broke down during stay. We were made to use the service elevators as there were no stairs??? Random dirty towel in front of our room the entire stay. Cleaning staff saw but never picked up or cleaned. Hair in room| carpets dirty| shower looked old and used. Sheets were stained and old as well.,0
Clean property,1
When we entered the room| the bathroom was not clean and the air conditioner did not work.  The hotel sent someone up immediately| but the AC never worked correctly through our stay.  Additionally| we were not told during check in that we had to make a reservation for our room to be cleaned. Therefore after spending all day at Disneyland| when we got back to our room| we had no clean towels to take a shower. Plus the elevators were not working and had to take the service elevator to our room.  One positive was the breakfast was very good.,0
"The elevator didn't work. Had to use the service elevator. Our room never get cleaned in our 3 days stay. The paid parking was always full so you have to go to another building like 2 blocks away from the hotel. The front desk lady was rude when I ask for water bottles (im Hilton honor) tell me to buy it from my room. The telephone guest service never works. By far the worst ""Hilton"" hotel ever stayed.",0
Quick trip for baseball game| hotel was very nice. We enjoyed being able to walk to/from the game. Would stay again. Staff was very nice.,1
Elevator broken. Only one working for entire hotel. No stairs going to ground floor. Insane waits if you're on floor 2 or 3 trying to go down| had to wait for multiple elevators to make the journey up and down.,0
The hotel looked dirtyWaited forever for one elevator for whole hotel,0
We arrived after 5pm and our room was not ready when we booked months ago.  üò©  There was also only one elevator working for the whole hotel.  There was always a line and long wait.,0
When I get to the room I was given the wrong room accommodations of which I paid for. The elevators were broken| there are knives and food in the lobby. There was also food from others guests in our room. I get switched to another room. There are cut phone lines but there's a community phone in the hall. Now why on earth during a pandemic would you have a community phone in commission and not a personal one? This place is worn and raggedy as hell. As is the lady in front shaped like a penguin. Then they gave the audacity to make you pay for parking overnight after paying 350 for a room. Bye.,0
the room was on the 5th floor |  there was only one elevator  and the other was broken |  i had a real hard time to get downstairs | as it was full all the time.also my stay was from Tuesday June 29 to checking out on Thursday  July 1st on Wednesday  night June 30th | when i came back to the room | i took off all my jewelry| near the coffee Machine and on Thursday morning when i woke up  | there was none there . i checked all my bags and belongings | to think that .maybe i left it somewhere else and could not locate anything . I hate to think that someone came to my room in the middle of the night and took them. i asked your house keeping to check for them and there is nothing to be found . i also had a small bag with card and some cash which is missing from my bags. could you check on them please ?,0
Everything was in room so,0
I had an issue with check in and the way the facility was not cleaned. I got charged fees that should have been addressed when I reserved the room online. The elevator did not work so we were constantly going to the service elevator to get to our room. We got charged $26 a night for parking when there was no parking for hotel guests. The hotel stay was unacceptable for the price I paid when I arrived. Inaccurate times for breakfast as well. Just a horrible experience. Will not be visiting this hotel again.,0
A very good hotel with good service. Rooms are very clean and comfy. Parking was a hassle if you come in a little late. Only one elevator was working leaving people stranded most of the time (there was a lot of disappointment due to that). Breakfast was very limited (maybe because things are still opening up after Covid). Overall a great stay.,1
Staff was excellent very professional and kind. Carpet was very dirty on the 5th floor. Second elevator inoperative.,1
We enjoyed it so much we booked another stay right on the spot for a future visit!,1
First bad experience here! Normally we stay here for a easy/close walk to the stadium| but we will be searching for a new hotel next time. Nothing was the fault of the employees (or lack there of)| the employees were all nice and professional| there just wasn't very many! One person at the desk checking everyone in with long lines. The room was dated with heavily stained carpet and the pull out sofa ‚Äúmattress‚Äù was more of a metal wire frame with absolutely no cushion. COMPLETELY unsleepable! My son had to sleep on the narrow (stained) sofa cushions. The included breakfast buffet was,0
Everything was great except only one elevator was working. Long line.,1
We were told our room was a downgrade on check-in| with less beds for our group then what we booked| when in all actuality| we were indeed given the room we had booked. Not happy at all until we saw it was indeed the correct room. This property charges a daily parking fee ($26/night)| but there was no parking to be found 2/5 nights. They say there is a parking garage| but you will be towed without an appropriate permit for designated parking| and there were no hotel designated parking spaces in the garage. No refund. Next| we were told breakfast would be served until 10am. I arrived at 9:15 for breakfast| we weren't the only ones who were lied to. Laundry service: the washer worked| but both of the dryers did not. Front desk would not accommodate drying our clothes and wouldnt refund for what we had payed to dry our clothes. Not only wasted hours trying to dry clothes in dryers they knew didnt work| also had to go to a laundromat as a result of the hotel not being able to provide a service they offer. And once again| no refund. There was only one functional elevator for the entire hotel making getting in and out or around the hotel aggravating. Our room was infiltrated with marijuana and cigarette odor through the vents. Not a fan of either of those smells. Not expected in a non smoking hotel. Went swimming one day| pool is decent| no towels| not many people. Definitely won't come back.The breakfast was delicious as long as they tell you the correct time. Beds cozy.,0
It was fine for an overnight. What was not fine was charging us $26 to park our car overnight. Our reservation confirmation said nothing about this parking fee. Everyone arrives by car. Ridiculous price to park in their parking lot!,1
Not good the elevator was broken,0
Disappointing stay and not worthy of the embassy suites name.,0
Very unprofessional with front desk| Unable to find the reservation and kept asking for confirmations and email. Finally found my reservation at Expedia??? Room is next to the construction side and very noise like the machines's ran all night. Location is not find on the map and parking was fulled unable to find a parking drive around 30 minutes to find a parking.  Bad stayed.,0
Entire property is in dire need of complete renovation. Room windows so fogged unable to see out. 1 of 2 Elevators under 3 week maintenance project and had to take service elevator. Other guests stuck in elevator for an hour and fire department let them out. Called for furnace/air conditioning repair 3 times and unit very loud. Little space in parking lot at night. 2 room phones not working and replaced. Microwave had to be replaced. Property sandwiched in between 2 freeways and very loud. No pool towels and staff did not maintain pool area. You can walk to Angels stadium but crossing many lanes on State College street is very dangerous. Small ants on property bushes got into our car at night. Got some credit for bad parking situation. Bed was comfortable and room was clean upon arrival.,0
The bathroom tub was disgusting you can clearly see ppls hair in there and a line of where the water was stopped the sink would clog the shower was dirty when we got there how to clean my own shower the phone was broken ac only worked on one side of the room The front desk was overly rude the elevator would get stuck all the time asked for a bell hop or help with my bags was told I had to take my stuff on my own to the 10th floor alone being only 4‚Äù10 alone with lots of bags having to walk to the other side of there parking at 4am cause there's no one to help was scary don't ever recommending this place,0
Eveything was great. Favorite pkace to stay in that area.,1
My room had a bad smell and the carpet in the bedroom was soaked from an unknown source.,0
I liked how nice the rooms were and how clean everything was.,1
Everything was great| from the room to the service. Having 2 pilots was a plus,1
Jajaja ahorita para ir s Disney tienes que reservar meses antes de ir.Yo estuve en espera en la pagina  de Disney por 15 horas ! A la pr√≥xima ya que est√° todo abierto para todos hacemos un viaje de la familia Astiazaran.First off| the hotel didn't have hot breakfast on weekdays which was the whole point of reserving this hotel.when I called the property to make sure| they said they did have hot breakfast however it was a limited menu. Second| both hotel elevators were not working and the stairs are for emergency only and we were told not to use them ! So how r we supposed to get to our room when we got back from Disney ??? The fire department was at the hotel when we arrived at 10 pm from Disneyland and people were stuck in one elevator while the other hadn't been working. They had us go to the service elevator which was packed and we had to wait to get to our room. This whole experience was unacceptable of a hotel. If the elevator isn't going to work they need to make the stairway accessible. Third| they don't clean your room.Fourth| there's no hbo or movie options.The elevator itself was the biggest issue. Guests could not social distance because initially the first day there was one working elevator. Guests were jam packed liked sardines in the elevator because we were waiting 30 min just to get in! Everytime it stopped at our floor it was packed. This caused delays to our plan and we will never be staying at this property again.,0
I like everything there it was a great stay there and would come back,1
When we arrived there was no carts to takes our things to our room. One of the elevators did not work we had to wait more than 30 min to be able to go down for breakfast and another to go up to our room. The breakfast was bad  I really don't know what happened to this place. üò´,0
Excellent service amazing staff very friendly. Outlets are 2 minute drive. Plenty of restaurants around the area.,1
You pay for parking| then there is no place to park. Exercise equipment was out of commission. Indoor pool area was filthy. Garbage running over outside of the building everyday! They had no available towels! We stayed 4 nights| no one came and cleaned our room as we requested. The 3rd day into our stay they came and ‚Äúcleaned‚Äù they gave us fresh towels and left the sheets for the beds on the couch...I thought they made the beds. Overall stay was not good. Oh...ONE working elevator for the whole building. Ridiculous!,0
I was not happy with the breakfast | they ran out of beacon| and what they had was very greesy| like for food was unorganized and servers were rude. The only reason I stay only at embassy suites is for their breakfast and it was not what we are used to. The pool was closed no no Access  in year of limiting access. The room was very clean and layout was good.,0
Very clean just sad no made to order breakfast or evening cocktails and drinks due to covid,1
It was just a mid week getaway. Very nice hotel and staff was helpful. I will stay again.,1
Loved the hotel and how close everything was to it. Was walking distance to the Angels stadium and breweries!,1
I didn't like that parking was $26 for overnight self parking.  I didn't see it listed on the site.  With that being said| the hotel was pretty good to excellent.  Only had 1 elevator working due to the hotel being refurbished.  I would recommend as it is located right off the freeway and easy to find restaurants and other stores.,1
Very nice place and clean rooms.,1
The room was nice but there was no free WiFi| no free parking| staff wasn't very friendly| and it was overall not the best experience me and my spouse have had staying in a hotel.,0
"BEWARE!!! SOME CRAZY LIES GOING ON HERE. PAYING FOR REVIEWS!! THIS PLACE IS CLOSED!!!!!! YET STILL TAKING RESERVATIONS. THE PHONES DON'T EVEN RING JUST SAY THEY'RE ""BUSY"" THERE IS NO ONE THERE!!!! HOTELS.COM SAYS THEY WERE NEVER INFORMED OF THIS AND ARE STILL TAKING RESERVATIONS FOR HERE WHICH IS WHERE I BOOKED THROUGH. MY WIFE EVEN WROTE A WARNING REVIEW ABOUT IT AND IT DOESN'T SHOW ON ANY OTHER GOOGLE ACCOUNTS WEVE TRIED OTHER THAN HER OWN. SOMETHING FISHY IS DEFINITELY GOING ON. THEYRE RE DIRECTING PEOPLE TO BOOK AT A DOUBLE TREE NEAR THERE WHICH IM SURE IS THE SAME OWNER OF THE EMBASSY. SINCE MARCH! YET WHERE ARE THE REVIEWS ?WHERE is the truth ?? I'm not the only one who booked here since March that this has happened to. What in the actual eff is going on ?!",0
We enjoyed the breakfast and complimentary cocktail reception,1
Had a great time everything was perfect.Enjoyed the location and everything was close to everything we wanted to see,1
I like  everything property was beautiful.  Staff was very helpful  bed was very comfortable,1
The staff friendly| the room was clean..the lights in the bathroom too bright| the view ok..of the freeway| next time I will ask for the other side. The snacks at 5pm ok and breakfast ok. What I was really disappointed was the parking fee $26 overnight.. Really?,1
They didn't properly clean my room| everything else was great,1
For the first three nights there wasn't any housekeeping done| we told the night manager and some housekeeping lady and no one listened until we spoke to the general manager; the parking spaces are very limited| there's like cero security and once the main parking is full you can park in the back and then you have to jump between cars to get back in the main property| but you still pay for that space. The only good think about our stay there was the breakfast.,0
Very nice and clean. Easy access to restaurant and lobby. Staff very helpful and courteous.,1
Great experience| clean|friendly| definitely i will be back to this location,1
The buffet isn't like it used to be but overall really good hotel!,1
Very convenient that breakfast is served| specially when you have kids.,1
Everything was pretty much good| except the pool situation. My family and I wanted to take the kids in the indoor pool in the morning. I called the day before checkin to make sure that the pool was in fact heated. They assured me it is always heated. Then I read some reviews where they said the pool was cold. So I call again. Different person| similar response.  We get there - the kids are super excited to swim - ice cold! I ask at the front and they say it hasn't really worked in awhile. They're waiting for a part. Need to share this information with other staff.,1
The property was clean and the staff was amazing. I didnt like the breakfast buffet they didnt have variety and the food had no flavor. My husband enjoyed the omelette station. My kids loved the pancakes.,1
Booked a beautiful suite with a balcony.  Lots of room| very quiet.  Clean facility.  Walking distance to Angels Stadium.  We took advantage of the big breakfast buffet.  Food was very good| and there were a lot of choices.  One of the main 2 elevators was out of service| but other than that it was a perfect stay.  I would stay here again.,1
Loved the pool! It was perfect for all ages!! The hotel lobby is very nice and the room were very clean.,1
Great staff. Happy hours nachos got old after the second day.,1
The outside and the courtyard are nice. Our room had peeling shower base. We thought it was dirty so we tried to clean it but it wasn't dirty it was peeling paint. Breakfast here is wonderful! Service staff is wonderful too. Another annoying thing is the vacuum at 2am in the hallway.,1
Used for an event at Anaheim Stadium which was walkable but a little isolated for any thing else. Restaurant offer somewhat limited| breakfast was ok.,1
We had comfortable stay and the breakfast was good. We enjoy staying at this hotel each time.,1
Stopped for couple days friends wedding. Bed were amazingly comfortable. Very clean and spacious room. I'll be back thank you,1
room service was quick. front desk was friendly. we were promised a bathtub and unfortunately did not receive one.,1
The breakfast was awesome and the room was great as my son was sick at the time of arrival which they assigned us a room basically with 2 bedrooms. The front desk clerk was fantastic!!!,1
Always a great stay.. Third year in a row that our family has stayed here for the Supercross races.,1
Stayed for the new year one of worst hotel stays in last 20 years. The floor in the room was wet in the bedroom roof leaks on the 10th floor manager says hotel is full can't do anything for a couple days. There made to order breakfast was a joke a best no plates no cups and ran out of food everyday. Worst managed hotel for $200 a night ever and they charge for parking that they don't tell you about until you get there. The staff said sorry about the issues with the breakfast. They been asking for more plates and cups and food for 4 months at no avail and cut there hours from 8 to 5 Hours's day in the kitchen and it shows horrible place to stay poorly managed.,0
Overall condition of property is good. Three bad rating came from pour customer service. On check out Dec 27| 2019|  I left behind a big bright make-up bag handing I  the back of the  bathroom door. I called the hotel next day and they gave me a website to report it. I've been calling hotel every second day or so speaking to various staff from front desk manager to housekeeping managers| but no-one has been able top provide any update.  They claim all found items are returned to lost property department|  but it's been over 10 days and I've not heard from the hotel. So my advice to future guests is if you accidentally leave something behind|  consider it lost,0
Really love the breakfast and evening reception. Don't like the noise at night from the bar since it's in the open lobby. But overall a great place to stay.,1
The staff are very nice & helpful. The property seems older & run down. Elevator was down two of the days we were there. Had to ask for TP & towels - no extras in the room. A bag of opened chips left from maid service. We've always had great experiences with Embassy but not sure I'd stay at this one again.,0
House keeping could be a little better. Garbage was not picked up,1
Too many things out of order. No towels at pool| not just one time ( BUT 3 TIMES ). They not more workers and managers need to stop being cheap. I know this business I use to work in it. It's all about dollars  ... don't forget the customers . I can go on and on and on. They need to stop being cheap and fix's this beautiful hotel.,0
This property was amazing. Close to the outlets|Disney etc Rooms were spacious| very clean and quiet. Staff were very helpful and friendly.  Very affordable Amenities were great. Free happy hour each afternoon and the buffet breakfast was great. We will stay here again for sure .Highly recommend,1
Another great stay.... wish breakfast had more options... but overall great service üòä,1
Property looks great. Reminds me of a  cruise ship,1
NOTHING | I LEFT THE FACILITIES| SPIDER| PHONE DOES NOT WORK| NEXT TO A FREEWAY AND EXTREMELY NOISY AND DID NOT GET SLEEP,0
I was Charged 25 dollars for parking|shouldnt that be included in the reservation fees,0
Stayed at the Embassy Suites because I like the brand| the price was right and it was located close to the Honda Center| where I was attending a hockey game.Staff was friendly and efficient Fromm the moment I drove on to the property.,1
My family used VRBO to get an awesome deal on this Embassy Suites hotel stay. From the very friendly staff| to the cleanliness and size of our room| to the delicious breakfast| this is a great place to stay for your next Disney vacation. Another perk is that they have a shuttle service that picks up right around the corner from the hotel that is the perfect alternative to having to drive and park at the Park. They pick up every 40 mins. This hotel is the first pick up from the hotel and first drop off on your return. I would give this Embassy Suites more than 5 stars| if I could!! Thank you for having a quiet| comfortable| clean place for us to stay after our VERY long| tiring days at Disney!!,1
Nice stay. Staff very accommodating,1
Very friendly staff.  The Breakfast was awesome.  Will definitely stay there again.,1
Great Breakfast. Washer and Dryer room not working which was the negative.  Spacious enough.,1
The hotel is so outdated and looks old. We like the breakfast. The staff are not so accomodating too.,0
It was an ok stay| but definitely not worth the cost per night| plus having to pay $25 a day for parking and 9.95 a day for wi-fi. I've stayed at less expensive hotels that were actually nicer and included amenities| free breakfast| plus free parking and free wi-fi. The pull out sofa bed mattress was terrible for my daughter. It feels like you're laying on a thin piece of cloth over coils. My husband said the bed hurt his back| but it was fine to me.  Breakfast was plentiful| it wasn't great tasting| but it was ok. If you come in late at night| there might not be any parking in the hotel lot| and you will have to park in the lot next door. It happened to us twice. The room was very clean| and front desk service was great. All in all| I wouldn't choose to stay at this hotel again.,0
We had to change rooms first room was very diry| blanket on bed had stains| floor was not vacuumed|  crumbs on floor|  phone did not work| and the door to the room was busted| looked like it had been kicked in a few times. Changed to a new room and the floor in there didnt look like it had been vacuumed either. Coffee pot outlet did not work| shower door had soap scum and rust and hair.,0
Hotel was clean and the beds were comfortable. Very convenient location. The only complain is that the breakfast was terrible! I understand it's included for free but how hard is it to make decent tasting eggs?,1
Great location for Disneyland and Angel Stadium for the price. Breakfast included was very nice. Staff was welcoming and helpful.,1
It was really good. The breakfast was great and we got a free upgrade for our room.,1
It was clean and the room service was done every day thank you good work,1
Clean and safe stay. We usually stay in Garden Grove for Disneyland but it was booked. This was a little cheaper and only a 10 minute drive to the parks. This might be our new official spot to stay. Made to Order Breakfast is quick| easy and filling. Parking is a pain| most of the time it is full and you will have to park in the overflow lot (which isn't far but still...who wants their car way off where you can't see it).,1

Had a great stay! The only thing that was slightly annoying was all the noise coming from the lobby/bar at night! But that's just because of how everything is shaped! Overall the stay was amazing and I will definitely stay there again!,1
I wasn't expecting the charges of the parking| it was ridiculous. Definitely not staying here again. Will be not recommending others to stay due to the excessive parking charges.,0
Overall the service and the location are pretty good.,1
I loved this hotel and would definitely recommend it| the rooms are wonderful| breakfast is super good| the location is perfect üëå LOVED IT!! I would love to stay again! I also loved that it was close to an awesome mall| Disneyland & Knotts Berry Farm and good restaurants.,1
First stay at this location.  Staff was very friendly and wanting to help.  Rooms were well kept and comfortable.  Free happy hour never hurtd| lolI will stay here again,1
The made-to-order omelet station and other great breakfast items always makes these hotels a great choice. Parking can get tight but we always found a spot.,1
Overall| property was dirty and under maintained.Dirty dishes everywhere| broken doors| etc.,0
The staff was the best and we loved everything about our room.,1
The room was clean. Was kind of upsetting when both phones didn't work so I wasn't able to call the front desk. I had to walk all the way downstairs to ask them a question and the girl at the front desk talked was a little rude. coming from someone who works in the customer service she could of been alittle better . I didn't catch her name. I don't if I would come back and stay at that hotel.,0
Incredible breakfast included and excellent room too.,1
Our first night water leaked from shower out through bedroom door and the phones were out. Second day we were not left any hand towels| wash cloths| coffee accessories were not replenished and ice bucket still had melted water form night before. When we were on our way out we let the front desk know of the discrepancies and he said he would let staff know. When we returned we noticed we left the do not disturb sign on door and when we walked in we had an overabundance of coffee items and towels on table. Still no was cloths and we didn't like the fact that they came in with the do not disturb sign up.  Day 3 came back about 5pm and our room was still being cleaned.  We had to wait 10 minutes to get access to our room. Not ok after a long day and still no wash cloths. My husband went down to desk| because we still had no phone| and they sent up a huge bag of towels ( only 2 of us staying in room) A little overboard if u ask me. He only asked for a couple of wash cloths. We felt the desk staff was good but the cleaning staff not so much. When i asked why room is still being at 5pm she proceeded to tell me about the staffing issues. I interrupted her and stated Not my problem and customers don't need to be burdened with in house issues. We expect to come back from a long day to a room that is clean and supplied with all items that the hotel provides.,0
i loved the breakfast in the morningi didn't like that the pool was not filled.,1
Beautiful landscaping| liked the amenities| nice size rooms| and best sleeper sofa| I have ever seen.,1
Seemed a little old in places and the pool was closed for renovation.,1
Great hotel. Nice and clean rooms. Love that this hotel is pretty close to the angel stadium.,1
Process of check in was fast. Service was friendly| convenient location| close to my conference. Breakfast is always the best.,1
Love staying here while we are in town visiting Disney,1
Very nice big room| beds very comfortable.  Buffet was ok. Had better selections at other Hilton hotels. Also| buffet only 6-9 weekdays| ends to early. A lot of parking spaces available for $20 a day.,1
My Sons and I had a greatWeekend in the OC.   This hotel was great!!   We will definitely come back!!!,1
Excellent customer service| peacefully| pleasant we love the Embassy suite don't make a mistake and stay anywhere else,1
Rooms were clean and really nice. Had a mini fridge which we used to store fruit for the kids. Included free breakfast in the morning. Workers who served us were friendly. Overall a positive atmosphere. Would definitly come back.,1
The breakfast buffet and evening receptions were fantastic.  The rooms were spacious and clean.  The downside was that there were only two elevators and one was not working for pretty much our entire stay.  The stairs are alarmed so we could not use them as an alternative. As a person who likes to walk| be prepared for at least a 15 - 30 minute walk to get to anything but there is a little shop onsite for snacks. It is also conveniently located to the baseball stadium| outlet mall and Disneyland.,1
It was a great time,1
I was very upset by the fact that they charge $25 per day to park a car. This is a hotel with a large parking lot. It is in California| the land of cars. Guests can't bring their car up to the room| so they need a place to park. They charge more than enough per night for a room. The parking should be free. I'll even offer a compromise-$25 for your entire stay,1
We stayed two nights in a King Suite on the 10th floor. Very comfortable beds with a lot of room through out the suite. Very convenient to the Honda Center. We attended an Elton John concert and it was a fast| easy drive from the hotel. The complimentary hot breakfast was delicious. The hotel| also| has an evening reception nightly that included fresh fruit| snacks and free drinks. I told my husband that you feel like you don't want to leave when your check-out day arrives. I would like to stay here again - only longer than two nights.,1
We had a nice room overlooking the river. That is about the best I can say. Front desk is not the friendliest and the room was really stuffy. But the worst was when we had to call twice because housekeeping did not put a top sheet on the bed. And when they finally showed up they just handed it to me. I had to remake the bed myself. This room costs way too much for that type of service. I would definitely not recommend this hotel.,0
I was nice that there was an indoor and outdoor pool.,0
Easy to access to the baseball stadium and Disneyland!,1
Cleanliness.  Great place to stay.  It is good to have a whole family for breakfast,1
Didn't like that they had no shuttle to Disneyland| so had to pay parking at the hotel then parking at Disneyland,1
Nice big room for price. Quiet.  Windows very dirty. In living room there was the constant noise of running water from the vent like a loud fountain. Staff very attentive. Had to ask for more towels daily like they did not remember we had four people. Nice big breakfast. Wish they didn't charge $20 for parking.,1
Excellent hotel| from the breakfast to the complimentary reception. We couldn't have asked for more,1
Very comfortable place very clean and nice staff really love this place,1
Attended UFC event and baseball game. Staff was exceptionally friendly and efficient| especially the bar tender and the waiter.  Would have rated this staff five stars except for the $75 (surprise) parking fee for the three days we were there. This was not mentioned when we booked or when we checked in.,1
Major blackout for hours. Manager promised to make things right but never did,0
"Easy access from two freeways and close to Angel Stadium. Very simple decor. Swimming pools were cold/cool. Food was good| but not hot. Happy hour was too ""simple.""",1
Hotel is very nice. We got there a bit after 3 and our room wasn't quite ready which was ok cause check in wasn't until 4| so they took are number and said they would call us when the room was ready. Which they didn't it was only until we went up to the counter after 4pm. The elevator is extremely slow| but the breakfast was good and the hotel was clean. I have stayed there before which is why I returned.,1
Good stay and very clean. Very nice staff. Close to attractions.,1
Great room and breakfast included.,1
Payed more to stay here vs. another hotel because of the amazing location and look of this place! Very pleased ‚ù§Ô∏è,1
We loved the location. It was close to the theme parks. The staff was helpful with the following issues| the first room we were in had a leak in the loght fixture over the bathroom toliet. It was dangerous. They moved us to a room on level 9 that had issues of its own. Half the pligs didnt work| the vent where the ac was fell down in the middle of the night. The safe was out of batteries and the sink leaked water. We were excited about breakfast but it gave us disentary every daym,0
Clean and inviting....................................,1
Always a great stay,1
The lobby and eating area was unique and very inviting. The staff was very friendly. The pool area was hidden and very sparse.,1
Liz Acevedo at the front desk was Outstanding! Courteous and helpful. Really made us feel welcome.,1
Breakfast was amazing!!! Clean room and facility! Staff are always friendly and helpful. I will definitely stay here again next time we go back to California.,1
Always a great place to stay! Close to the outlets and Disneyland. Rooms are comfortable and has enough space for our family of four.,1
Very clean. Open bar 5-7pm. Only con was there is one elevator and we had to wait 15 mins for one.,1
I love the embassy suites| they are always clean and have great staff. Love their happy hour and morning breakfast also.,1
Everything about the hotel was nice. The lobby the rooms great hospitality.,1
Close to everything. Free way is closed by. Breakfast is good in the morning.,0
They gave me free parking| the free breakfast & cocktail hour was a sweet surprise! The rooms are clean and very spacious. Definitely stay here again!,1
Great property and right next to The Angels Stadium.,1
I was quoted a price on Expedia and overcharged 40$. When I asked the be refunded they said there system was down and they would do it later. Never got done,0
Very clean| comfortable rooms and excellent breakfast (included),1
it was fine| obviously an older hotel.  When you step out of the room it immediately smells like food.,1
I haven't stayed here since i was little it was great! And our view was amazing we were able to see angel Stadium,1
Breakfast was great| house cleaning was great,1
Staff was great. Breakfast was a little chaotic but remaining food was great,1
Great location near many local attractions. Clean and well equipped hotel plenty of parking,1
You really need to update your sofa bed. We stayed in unit 702 and I had to sleep on the sofa bed for 3 nights. All I could feel were coils pushing against my body. I could even hear the sounds of the coils each time I moved on the sofa bed mattress. Also| if I reserved for 6 people| why are there only 3 bath towels in the room? I had to call for 3 more towels and waited 1 1/2 hrs just to get them.,1
Front desk staff went out of their way to make our check-in pleasant and quick.,1
Room was not properly cleaned| found clothes in room on flor from previous occupant|  TV was broken in room| they made us pay for a new TV even though we never was able to use it.  Would not use Hilton again.  If they don't even clean clothes off the floor imagine what else they don't clean...,0
The room smelled and everything was sticky. It was also noisy.,0
.lots of parking. nice lobby area. Ugly popcorn ceilings in the bedrooms| no vents in the bathrooms,0
Checking in and out was very easy.  Staff was very friendly and accommodating.,1
Perfect location not much traffic relatively speaking| walking distance to Angel stadium and must eat Golden Road brewery,1
Fantastic stay and loved the hot breakfast buffet! Would have been better if parking was free| but I guess you can't have everything.,1
Parking area was restricted| and if arriving late in the evening you are directed to park in an adjacent overflow area in spots marked '2 hours'. If the next day is a weekday you have to move your car before 9 am. Very poor| when you are being charged $25 per day for car parking.,1
Need to add more elevators. During our stay they don't allow to use the stairs.,1
Front staff was fantastic. Booked a reservation last minute and They were able to get us in a couple hours later. Had a corner room that gave us a little more room  which was nice. All areas very clean! Very happy with stay.,1
The staff was excellent. Always willing to go the extra mile. However| we had to change rooms the first night as water was leaking in our bathroom bathtub wall and leaking from the shower stalls light fixture. Definitely a safety issue. We changed rooms the following morning and the rest of our stay was pleasant.,1
The building was very nice| but we didn't get the good view of the nightly fireworks,1
Overall great stay it was beautiful| everyone was friendly| only thing was no free WiFi.,1
They keep making charges even after it's been a week I stayed there!,0
I had ankle surgery and requested an ADA King room.  Upon check in I was given a double standard room.  At 4 am I discovered the shower was not functional.,0
Excellent accommodations| outstanding service| great complimentarybreakfast| handy parking facilities| good proximity to many attractions|friendly and helpful staff,1
Very clean| modern| and overall really nice hotel! I would definitely stay there again and I would highly recommend it.,1
Perfect location and close to Disneyland | very clean and good breakfast | room very clean and staf very nice .,1
My check in went well| considering it was at 1am and I was the only client.   The gentleman was understanding of my tiredness and let me get on my way quickly.   Over the 4 night stay| I cannot say the same as the service people were very difficult to get hold of by phone and at the front as they seemed to always be busy with line ups and often only 1 staff member,0
Every thing was perfect! The location was easy to find| close to our destination. Check in and out was a breeze! Everyone was super friendly and smiling. The room was very nice| more than we expexted. The guy who checked us out was super nice. I dont remember his name but he has an awseome joker tattoo on his left arm. His service and friendliness was super appreciated.,1
The last night of our stay (Feb 9th)| I was awakened at 2:00a.  There was a cealibg leak in our bathroom.  I am expecting a refund for that night per the manager on duty.,1
The hotel was very clean| modern and conveniently located. The complimentary made-to-order breakfast was delicious and the complimentary drinks in the evening were much appreciated. The hotel is beautiful. The rooms were comfortable. The staff was extremely friendly.,1
"This hotel is not a business friendly hotel and is extremely outdated. The small cost of bringing it up to today's standards has not been invested which says a lot about their emphasis. This hotel has no concept of what ""Guest"" means. Find another hotel and avoid the aggravation.",0
We enjoyed the indoor pool| breakfast| and complimentary drinks.,1
The front desk staff was polite and helpful! The breakfast staff was friendly and efficient! And the evening reception bartenders were welcoming and courteous!,1
Housekeeping requires an improvement. Insufficient towels and hangers in room. TV remote didn't work.,1
We were given a room that was intended for persons experiencing disabilities. Therefore| we could not hang out close in the closet (no full length way to hand pants or dresses). After taking a shower| the area leading out to the bedroom flooded the entire carpet. After waiting nearly two hours| the front desk sent a ‚Äúhousekeeper‚Äù up and told her she was supposed to clean up a ‚Äúspill‚Äù. None of the phones in the room were working. Overall| a very disappointing experience.,0
Close to disneyland| we got to see fireworks from the room.,1
Free breakfast with ability to order what you wanted was a nice perk.,1
We stayed for the Monster Truck show. It was fun.,1
Room was nice. It does look like it needs a bit of an upgrade but overall good place to stay at. Breakfast was good.,1
Liked being close to Angel StadiumLoved the great free BreakfastProperty is showing its age stuck doors| wore out stuff,1
Everything was fantastic and service is excellent.,1
Great place to stay| friendly and helpful staff| and comfortable bed and room.,1
The room was dirty and smell a cigarette The elevator smell like a dog and dirty,0
3 TVs in the room| swimming pool| very close to Disneyland and free shuttle to Disneyland. Great breakfast. The only problem I saw is the 2 elevators are not enough around breakfast time| I waited 30 minutes by the elevators but still ended up taking the stairs. There are fake alert warnings at the exit doors at the end of these stairs. If I knew they were fake this would have saved me 30 minutes.,1
This was a great stay.  We loved our spacious room.,1
Free shuttle every hour to Disneyland was convenient. Made to order omelette breakfast was great. Overall the stay at Embassy Suite was excellent. We will use it again for sure.,1
Everything was great except the elevator. There's only 2 elevators and one was  ot operational so it was a bit of a wait.,1
The hotel was clean and welcoming. The checkin was a mess. There was a line| however| people kept walking up and ignoring the line. The hotel staff didn't speak up and helped those people. It was annoying and the staff didn't apologize for the line cutting. The rooms were clean and valet was great.,1
Good when you have kids with you. Shuttle bus to Disneyland is very handy. Breakfast is excellent. We enjoyed our stay.,1
It was our first time staying at this hotel and it was very nice and had friendly staff. Great food and drink menu. Only two things I ddnt like was our door to our room ddnt fully shut due to it being broken/old. Also| our whole stay there our room smelt like weed. It was non smoking room but a guy who stayed there was smoking weed CONSTANTLY that it traveled through the vents and stunk up our room. Unfortunately the staff didn't take care of that problem as fast as they shld of| so we had to deal with the smell for two days. But over all I would definitely stay there again,1
Nice hotel| front desk service excellent. Close to Disneyland and many restaurant.,1
Loved the free Disneyland shuttle. Breakfast was good but no take out plates available.,1
Very spacious| clean and comfortable. Staff are very attentive to our needs and very courteous.,1
Check-in took awhile. There were two people working and neither acknowledged anyone waiting in line. I was not informed about complementary happy hour or breakfast. I was not informed I would be charged for parking. If the check-in process was done correctly I would rate my stay higher. When I got in my room there was one sneaker in the corner of the room from a previous guest. The property is clean. There were lots of people in the pool. Later in my stay I called maintenance because the hot water handle of the sink was loose and I couldn't turn the water off. That experience was nice and well handled. I usually just drop my room key to check out but the valet asking me about paying for parking (even though I parked myself)| so I went inside to chat with someone. I stood in line again| and waited 15 minutes not being acknowledged by front deck staff before I asked if there was someone else that could help me| because there was only one person working. The guy then said he hadn't seen me but would be with me shortly. I waited another ten minutes| 3 more people gathered waiting behind me in this time| I finally caved and just left without my questions being answered. How annoying.,1
Great hotel to stay near Disneyland. Breakfast was awesome.,1
Nice location| nice free breakfast. Some difficulty with getting cleaning staff to tidy/restock room.,1
Great for our stay. Everything wad very clean and there breakfast is amazing.,1
Great room & hotel cleanliness. Lines for the breakfast & evening cocktail hour were opened late & not ready. There were very long lines & traffic flow was not set up well.There were some outstanding| helpful staff in the restaurant| & some stoic staff at the front desk. It really makes a difference if the staff smile.,1
First I would like to start bye saying how pleasant and helpful all the staff where from the front desk|cooks|house keeping and last but not least ‚ÄúRay‚Äùthe shuttle driver who entertained everyone that road his shuttle with his jokes card tricks and singing.The made to order breakfast buffet was great and a must for any family with young children wanting to get the most out of there Disneyland trip.There was one major but easily fixable problem that we experienced and that was the boxspring mattress on the sofa bed.It was so incredibly bad that we all had a good laugh when we first noticed and then called down to the front desk of which with no problem at all moved us to a suite with 2 beds.,1
Great rooms and very comfortable stay| highly reccommended,1
Shuttle to Disney convenient| however| they don't run for the Magic Morning hour.  Stayed 8 nights but linen wasn't changed on beds.  Fantastic price based on shuttle and full buffet breakfast included.  Would stay again.,1
The staff was great and they were able to check me in earlier than the check in time which was wonderful after driving 8hrs.,1
Very impressed with the free full service breakfast available every morning along with the free happy hour beer and snacks. Nice clean room.....,1
The TV was terrible very few channels and many didn't work at all. I got charged for wifi and the wifi never worked. I did tell the front desk and they removed it from my bill.,1
Took way too long to register for room. Dishes were left in hallway for greater than 24 hours,1
Absolutely loved this property| except the 20 per day to park. If it wasn't for that hidden surprise it would have been perfect! The breakfast| reception| suite| shuttle  and pool were all amazing! Great property for a fair price. Stay here you won't be disappointed!!!,1
This is a beautiful hotel. Customer service was on point. Breakfast was really good. And then there is the room. Our room was not cleanest floors were dirty microwave was dirty. The worst part was the beds| they were very uncomfortable. We took our kids to Disneyland the last thing you want is to come back from a long day and have to sleep in a uncomfortable bed. We had a sofa sleeper in our room  which we all know probably aren't all that comfortable this one the kids couldn't even sleep on. You could feel the springs no padding whatsoever. We had to ask for a roll away it was more comfortable but not much more. The rooms need a make over. We paid over $600 for two night. Not worth it. I'm sure we could have found something better.,0
Corner suite was Perfect for Our Family Vacation weekend in Disneyland| The Breakfast was Wonderful!!! Helped Sooo Much| As The Mom of 2 teenagers| your time is Already consumed!! The Beds are Super Comfortable| Tub was on The small side if you are a taller Person| Tub and Shower are separate| So that is helpful for little ones and families... LOVED The Space Definitely Reccomend!!!,1
Hotel staff is a joke| I left my wallet at the room and called asking if it was ok to pick it up next day at 7:00 am and the front desk person said yes that there is always a manager on site which it was t true. We arrived at the hotel at 7:25 and we were told that the manager will arrive at 8:00 and that the manager is not always on site. We have an international flight to catch,0
Great for family. Grandkids loved the pool! Buffet was delicious. Fun to have happy hour for the adults.,1
Fantastic service by Grace when we checked in and fantastic service by samy at night shift great customer service for both but just had a very rude manager sandra not very good customer service at  all,1
Nice hotel. Great breakfast. Free shuttle to Disney.,1
Close to Disney and orange outlets. Would recommend,1
Loved the reception hour and omelets fro breakfast. Rooms were very comfortablePool should be open later than 10 pm on sat night,1
Check in was quick. Staff was very nice and courteous. Room and hotel was very clean. Definitely will be back.,1
Had some issues.  I requested a extra foam for the sofa sleeper.  Was extremely uncomfortable| that I never received.  Issues with the key pad low batteries.  This of course after all day at Disney and had to make 3 trips to the customer service desk.,0
Overall great stay.  Very nice hotel and would stay here again.,1
Nice hotel. Pretty close to Disney parks. Just 5 minutes. Excellent included breakfast. Just two thinks. For having a huge parking lote| 20 dollars per day it doesn't make sense. I should be included in the price. The internet is additional too. These services in more regular hotels are included  right now.,1
"Decent location to Angel Stadium and Downtown Disney.  If you don't mind a zillion kids running around and parents that don't know how to control their said kids| then this place is OK. The lines for breakfast were a bit too long. Only 2 employees working the made to order breakfast for approximately 75 people.  Not too good.  Managers reception was good.  ""Light snacks"" were mediocre.  Trail mix| gold fish crackers and fruit.  Something hot would have been nice| especially since there was a limited menu for room service due to a closed kitchen.   Staff was great.  Room service and front end were very friendly.  Hotel was a tad dirty.  Kind of expected with a lot of kids running around (Wipe down the elevator doors for goodness sake).  Rooms were OK.  No fans in the bathroom| made for quite of bit of discolorations on the walls and ceilings.  The one thing that bugged us the most was there was a convention in the hotel for travel agents and we continued to be solicited by them for 2 days on investing in a travel agency.  In the future| the hotel needs to tell them to not solicit guests.  Also| our room was very loud with traffic on the outdoor street.  Lots of motorcycles thinking it was a drag strip.  Overall| I would say this place caters more to the family scene vs. a couples weekend getaway.",0
Love this hotel and we'll be staying here every time we have a tournament. The beds are very comfortable and the breakfast is good.,1
This Embassy Suites hotel is great with friendly staff! It situated close to major freeways| Angles stadium| Disney| Knott's| several breweries and restaurants. We enjoyed our stay and highly recommend this location to other travelers.,1
Nice hotel close to Disneyland with hotel shuttle. Close to shopping and restaurants. Large rooms| ideal for families. Nice pool. Friendly & helpful staff.,1
Hotel was great but one elevator was broken during most of our stay. Other than that no complaints.,1
This is the second time we have stayed at this establishment and had an even better experience this time! We have a large family of 5 children and we won't stay anywhere else when we go to Disneyland! The suite is large enough| comfortable| and priced right. The breakfast is the best I have ever had at a hotel (we have 3 teenage boys so the breakfast saves use easily $50 a day). Now that they have remodeled the outdoor pool and added the Disneyland shuttle FREE (it used to have a charge) there is nothing I would change. Their front desk staff is friendly| courteous| and always go the extra mile. Hands down| the best hotel I've stayed at for a large family!,1
Very nice hotel. Shuttle to Disneyland. Staff  very helpful and fast to respond to requests for extra items needed in our room.,1
Loved the hotel| hated the pillows and shower,1
I will recommend this hotel anyone is was amazing staying there the breakfast was really good üëåüëçüëçüëçüòäüòä,1
The food was great and the bed was comfortable. I was hoping for the pool to be heated.,1
My family and I stay here every time that we come to Disneyland because it's very convenient (especially with children). The hotel provides breakfast between 6AM -10AM & yes at times the lines can be crazy but the staff do their best to accommodate everyone. Most importantly| the hotel has a shuttle that runs every hour to take guest to the Disneyland park (which is very convenient because you don't have to look/pay for parking). There are minor issues like long wait times for the elevator or kids running through the hallways at times or slamming doors but hey kids will be kids....lol Overall we've enjoyed our stay each time.,1
Customer service left some to be desired especially the guy at check out that probably needs to find a new job. How do they not offer pay per view movies? I thought the 2 hours of free drinks at the bar was pretty cool as was the the made to order omelets at breakfast.  Overall| the experience was good and I would return.,1
Great place to stay convenient and the shuttle to Disneyland was great! Breakfast every morning was fantastic,1
Free breakfast & free shuttle to Disneyland was great. It made up for the dated rooms and worn/stained couch in our suite. The bathroom needs some scrubbing to remove heavy mildew/grime buildup. However| staff and service was excellent!,1
Ac broke in the middle of the night. Kids asleep at 2am wsnt going to wake them either with a new room or maintaince fixing it. No ac made for a miserable night sleep,0
Clean location perfect  the stuff are very friendly good breakfast clean bathrooms and towel free shuttle to and from Disneyland.,1
I read some not so good reviews about this hotel after booking but have to say our experience was very nice. There were complaints about the temperature in the rooms but as picky as we are about it being cool| we were pleasantly surprised when we walked into the room and it was perfect. We stayed in a suite because we were expecting 2 more people to come with us and they couldn't make it. The room was very spacious.,1
Front desk tried to charge me $75 for checking out a day early with our prior notice from me. No prior notice given to me that I was aware of prior to arriving or during check in.Also| this property is very close to the freeway and very noisy. It appears the windows do not seal properly to prevent freeway noise.Not good.,1
I had to wait in the long line at Breakfast buffet.They should come up with better serving system.,1
I thought that all the staff were bery kind and wonderful.I had a great time.Thank you very much!,1
We were not aware of the strict covid guidelines that the hotel had in place. Not having breakfast was a big downside and was not communicated to us until check-in.,1
Excellent place | very clean | with a Great staff .that were knowledgable of the area and helpful and  courteous  . Thank you,1
Great time,1
The staff were friendly and quick to meet any requests. However| it didn't look like the bathroom had been cleaned. There was tons of hair stuck to the shower walls from the previous user and the shower didn't drain while in use| which made the discovery of the hair on the walls pretty gross.,0
In need of a face lift online says free breakfast hotel didn't provide one,1
Easy to get in and out. Traffic was not bad getting in or out of Chicago. The hotel was very clean and we did not get charged for an extra room key when we were locked out. We also had no problem getting on the elevators since we were on the 23rd floor. And wait times were never an issue. Overall perfect stay.,1
The room was very nice and big.,1
Great location. Clean rooms and friendly| helpful staff. Appreciated the kindness and check in!,1
The overall experience was very disappointing. The lady that talked to my wife was not friendly. However| the worst was finding hair from other people around the furniture and bathroom as well as finding food underneath the sofa.,0
Staff very friendly.Clean and comfortable accomodations.,1
Friendly | clean . Staff is always helpful. Quiet during the night .,1
Staff very friendly and helpful! Room was clean and comfortable. Nice viewDue to covid| miss free breakfast and room service.My mom was in hospital across the street.. Stressful. Such a great retreat for me to be able to rest at. Ty!,1
Was very clean,1
We had the best time| the staff was so helpful and kind to my entire family and the room was spotless.,1
Lanette at the front desk was AMAZING! She gave us late checkout as our train wasn't leaving until 1:30PM and she went and caught a cab for us!,1
Parking at hotel is closed had to find parking else where!,1
The smell in the room was terrible | the sheets smelled as well I asked the front desk to change them and nothing happened | I was uncomfortable staying there | never again,0
Location was great. My room wasn't the cleanest and outlets didn't work in restroom.,0
The front desk representative Lynette was very helpful and made a weekend with friends so much more enjoyable. Her enthusiasm and professionalism were exemplary.,1
Nice hotel right by shopping & dining| front desk staff especially Lanelle or Lunelle| not sure exactly but she appeared to be a manager and she was very very nice| very helpful| even made restaurant reservations for our party of 10| she was awesome,1
I liked it the property was close to Michigan avenue in the shopping what I didn't like is due to covet there's no option for breakfast restaurants or a type of eating or drinking on site also there is no free parking or discounted parking offered for your stay,1
I like that the staff was friendly and very helpful,1
The hotel itself was overall well placed. The issues I personally had was the damages to the room prior my visit. I already informed the front desk about the shower| but I also seen damages today that obviously happened prior my visit| and I don't want to be charged for damages I didn't cause since I was hardly here. If I can get in contact with management that would be great.,0
Amazing bringing in the new year,1
The property was not cleaned well there was no parking had to walk 2 miles for parking and had to paid high prices,0
I didn't like the fact that there was no parking and I didn't like that they didn't have indoor pool and breakfast,1
We canceled the reservation and i still was charged for it. Always call the hotels to see what are the deposit policies.,0
It was a good experience. I loved the view from our room.,1
Great area to be in. Very nice view. Customer service was good,1
It's was very and front desk was very helpful and polite,1
For the price and location of this hotel| one would think it would be up to par with other Hilton owned properties| but not the case. I witnessed one particular night staff clerk be rude to multiple guests checking in. The air conditioning in the room was TERRIBLE. Upon checking in| they notify you that you will be charged $100 per night for Incidentals (okay should've said so upfront| but whatever)| but then he promptly and bluntly states ‚Äúand we don't have parking| breakfast| or room service| plus the pool and gym are closed| so if you were expecting those items too bad.‚Äù All of which should've been sent in an email prior to checking in. Parking in the lot next door for 5 days was $300| yikes! I have always had great experience with Hilton owned properties| but alas| this one was a bust| and I will definitely chose another hotel upon my next stay in Chicago.,0
It was nice just had to do something about hurricane but other than that I would recommend this for a couple nights to my family and friends,1
This property charged me a whole day that I wasn't even there. I called to let them know I'll be arriving early next day and they told me thanks for letting them know. I get there and I was charged for 2 days instead of one. They told me that they had to hold my room. If I would of known that I would of just made a reservation at check in. Instead of online. I called and explained this to them and again they refused to reimburse me. On top of not having any ammennties due to covid. These people are a joke and I'll never book with them again. What a way to welcome out of towners to a city.,0
The View the cleanliness the location the bathroom the broom size I loved everything about it,1
The room was so hot| the air was not powerful enough and you couldn't turn it cool enough for it to make a difference. The lobby is small and old. The tv was small and only had very basic channels. I thought the standard for hotels was a smart tv for app sign ins and there was nothing on the way too small tv.,0
Everything was good except the parking spot because it was to expensive,1
Only realised it was run by Hilton on my arrival and as you would expect from the brand name| the hotel didn't disappoint. Can't say much about the location though as we were there during the pandemic the street was obviously deserted. Given the chance| I would give this area another try.,1
The property is in an excellent location downtown| but because of the Coronavirus staff to assist is very limited| no breakfast| no hospitality hour| and little assistance with help with baggage.  Please clean the common areas| coffee area| microwave regularly; this was the big disappointment.,1
"Booked the hotel the evening of March 12th. For whatever reason the dates were incorrectly submitted for the 26th of March. When i went to check in for the room on the 12th the gentleman stated i didn't have reservations| after looking into it further he caught the problem and said there is no reservation for tonight but its for March 26th. I said thats incorrect i need the room for this evening. He stated he would cancel the booking for the 26th and accommodate me for the evening of the 12th. After checking there were no rooms available but directed me to Homewood suites which is in the same building. I thought nothing more about the cancelation because he stated he handled it IN PERSON. I finally get back home to PA and sure enough 3 weeks later I am charged as a no show for the room the front desk supposedly ""canceled"" weeks prior.  I called and they stated without proof of him telling me he canceled the room they couldn't issue a refund. Not sure what we as consumers are supposed to do if we cannot go based off of the word of your staff. I guess ill just have to strap a go pro to my head and record every transaction i have to make sure i have that solid proof they need.",0
Lisa  checked us is right away and was very & had knowledge of the area,1
Very nice stay friendly staff,1
The elevators are extremely busy. Like| inconveniently so. And the hotel probably needs an update. It was good spot to stay for a date night though.,1
Garbage was never emptiedMade to feel I was a lessor client by the way the building entrance was set up| one side nice(Homewood Suites)the other not so nice(Hampton)Same at breakfast. Not nice. That said| Thank you for being across the street from the hospital where my husband was a patient| I would have accepted anything to be close to the hospital.,0
I didn't like that my room was next to the housekeeping room kept hearing a door swing al day,1
Very spacious rooms with great tv channels. Staff was AMAZING!,1
Great| the employees went over and above to help me out with anything,1
This is a great place to stay with a great staff and great location. However| I wouldn't suggest parking here because it is expensive| $69 US per night and the alternative parking company is $49 US per night. Better off taking an Uber to your destinations.,1
Location was excellent. Within walking distance to all the things we wanted to see.Lynette was excellent for making suggestions and getting us organized for the day.,1
"Asked to not use the card on file upon check-in| was told no problem| insert a new card| no problem. Turns out they used the one on file anyway.Got to the room| no wifi| no phone. Had to call via cell phone to the front desk for help| got hung up on.Without knocking or announcing themselves| room service just unlocked the door and walked in. When I said ""Hello?!?"" from further in the room| they yelled out ""sorry!!"" shut the door and took off. When I went out into the hall| they were hurrying away saying it was just room service - they were coming to reset our room as if we had checked out| but we still had another day on the reservation. The hotel only has 3 elevators. During their self proclaimed busiest time of the day| during their busiest checkout (post NBA All Stars)| they took one out of service to move furniture. It was so cramped| and start/stop| my girlfriend became lightheaded. She stumbled exiting the elevator| fell| smashed her face up. Even the EMT's couldn't get in easy. Then no one - not a single hotel person asked if she was ok upon our return. They all just stared at the floor and ignored us. Will NEVER stay here again.",0
Right the heart of everything we wanted to do.  Staff efficient and very friendly/ Very nice and clean room.,1
The parking space is ridiculous| valet should not be the only option made to guest.,1
It was great! The staff is very nice| clean rooms and great breakfast,1
Closeness to Shopping and Millennium Park. Great breakfast menu.,1
Comfortable room and  delicious breakfast,1
Convenience to shopping areas; walk ability and free breakfast.,1
I didn't like about the room style because it was congested.,1
Property was very dated.  Big red stain on carpet right by the closet.  Coating on bathtub was peeling off.  Dirty vents in the bathroom were clearly  visible.  Breakfast was ok.  Location was great. Overall| ok stay.,1
It has a great location| is clean and reasonably priced.,1
Great location. Within walking distance to Michigan Ave shopping. Great price for for the location!,1
There was always a long wait for the elevators.  We were on the 26th floor and had to wait every time we left the room.  The wait was usually 15-25 minutes.,1
Beware! Possible bedbugs! On the third night stayed there| had really itchy bits on my left leg. Checked my sheet briefly and found couple possible bed bug eggs. I didn't check thoroughly because I had booked a timed event that was almost due. (After thought| if you had the leisure to thoroughly check the room| please do so and best to catch a running bug if there is any.) Reported to manager and of course they have insurance for this and had a technician checked the room and found negative results. In the winter of Chicago| I don't think I was bitten by misquotes. I am sanitizing all my cloths and luggage to be safe!,0
it was a great stay. love the convenient location for shopping on Michigan Ave,1
The elevator wait took awhile and no microwave on the room much needed,1
It was great service and comfortable stay!!!,1
The room was amazing. Clean and the bed was very comfortable.,1
It's a great location and reasonable price for the stay.  The staff was helpful| the view of the city from room was  excellent.  We would definitely stay there again.,1
It was clean and the room was nice and warm when we arrived. The staff is friendly and efficient.,1
This hotel was great. Very clean and friendly staff. Be mindful of the time needed to catch an elevator around breakfast time. This is my only complaint. We had to take the stairs down to breakfast| 20 floors. :/,1
We had a great stay here last month. Maybe it was a quieter time to be here but we had no wait for the elevators| as has been mentioned in some other reviews. Breakfast was plentiful| with enough variety to keep our young son happy too. Staff across the hotel were very pleasant and helpful. Location was super convenient and room was clean| and beds very comfortable.,1
The room was spacious and clean and the bed was so comfortable. The front desk was so helpful and the check in process was really easy. The location is also great!,1
Very nice room.  Excellent temperature control.  Comfortable furniture.  Great location.,1
Our room was close to the elevators and you couldHear them all night long| which caused us not to get a good night sleep.  You also have to wait overTen minutes for elevators so we walked down 30 flights of stairs due to the bad elevators.  The only nice thing I can say is the room was very clean.,0
Great hotel in a great location.,1
Handicapped room was large| nicely furnished| wonderful beds. Very clean. Air conditioner could have been better but not bad.  Overall a wonderful experience. Staff was great. Food was best I ever had at a ‚Äúhot breakfast ‚Äú.,1
Bad bug bite my leg.  They changed room. I used several hotels but this is the first time.This was a very uncomfortable situation for me.,0
Loved the hotel.. great location,1
Breakfast was decent| the rooms were small but pleasing.,1
Comfortable!!!!,1
The only drawbacks were the elevators which were extremely slow during peak times (which are posted inside each one.) Also| it would be helpful to have more than one microwave in the food service area as there are none in the rooms.,1
Very friendly and helpful staff. They handed out small bags of water and snacks for anyone staying in the hotel which was a nice gesture.,1
Great location with very nice attached restaurant. Staff was wonderful.,1
Room was fine. Had a side view of the lake which was nice. Extremely small bathroom but very clean. Surprisingly quiet hallways which is always good. Great location. Mattress was comfortable but a not quite enough support. After three nights my back was not too happy. Rooftop pool needs some love.,1
The hotel location was perfect - close to all attractions as we could walk to them and only a 10 min drive by taxi from Union Station.  We enjoyed the free breakfast buffet every morning| and there were many great supper options at nearby restaurants.  Our room was very comfortable - we loved the bed - very very comfortable.  We would highly recommend this hotel - great value for the price.,1
The staff were all amazing!  Very friendly and helpful!  The rooftop pool area was not the cleanest though.,1
You could not get better customer service! The staff are AMAZING! It is a large hotel 40 floors with a rooftop pool which you Should use in the warmer months. Elevators get busy especially during breakfast and checkout/check in times BUT they do there best to help out and make sure you don't wait a long time.  The only issue is location is great for shopping and some sites  but you need to walk 15-20 mins to nightlife and other major stuff| not an issue necessary but something to consider. It's also a very safe area police present and it's always busy even late at night so there is no worries or even any issues. Overall it's a great place and I'd stay again.  Oh! Breakfast is fantastic for free breakfast!,1
The elevators were an issue for everyone at peak times|  and we had to wait long times for one to arrive|  and when it did| it was  full,1
Overall our stay was great! We stayed 2 nights| after night 1 we switched rooms. There was a banging noise that kept us awake most of the night. Staff was very helpful and understanding and moved us to another room. The ONLY issue was the valet| when I went to leave. I handed the young attendant my claim ticket and he tried to hand it to another young. It appeared as neither of them wanted to get my vehicle. 40 minutes later my vehicle is brought to the entrance. I had to ask for my keys| as I stood right next to the podium. They attendant watched me load all of our luggage and bags into the vehicle alone. He never said| one word to me from beginning to end. Not a hello| goodbye| or thank you! Robert the bellman was great| but was busy with someone else. All of the other staff went above and beyond. What makes me even more upset| I tipped the young man. Now| I sit here wondering| If I am crazy? I believe in being a good person| who takes others into consideration. I have taught my children to always be kind| go out of your way to help others. Say please and thank you. Always use your manners| it shows| they are complemented ALL the time. So| aside from that| our stay was wonderful.,1
The location is great| walking distance to nearly everything. The rooms are pretty big and beds are pretty comfortable.Staff is ok| one of our rooms smelled like cigarettes the moment we walked in. It was a very very small  room too. I called and  let them know of the smell asked to be moved and they did. Rooms are all supposed to be non smoking by the way.  if you're staying closer to the elevator| you can hear the elevator going up and down at every hr especially early morning. The downfall are the elevators| it gets very busy and ppl wait for elevator for 30 min. During breakfast time. Elevators are shared between Hampton Inn and Homewood Suites.,1
The location is good. The beds are very comfortable and the breakfast is a really nice breakfast. Exactly what you would expect from a Hampton. The only drawback with this hotel is the elevators. There are 3 but it is not nearly enough to handle the guests. So I would request a low floor room Incase you need to take the stairs. We walked down from the 20th floor and there was another couple ahead of us that was carrying luggage.,1
Great location. Great breakfast. Beautiful pool. The room air conditioner was very noisy.  The bathroom door needed to be repaired. It was badly warped  and ended up falling out of the door frame,1
Our family enjoyed a great stay at the Hampton. I very much appreciated the friendliness of staff. The location was just perfect in terms of walking distance to all attractions| or a short Uber ride. The breakfast spread was a great spread which everyone enjoyed| and it was kept hot and well stocked. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would come back. A few recommendations would be to turn down the AC in the halls| turn the pool heater on and bigger towels.,1
Great location - room was clean and comfortable. Elevator was slow| had to ask three separate times to receive a roll of toilet paper| and the thermostat was hard to regulate.,1
Excellent location! We walked to Navy Pier and Water Tower Place. Very friendly and helpful staff. Good breakfast. Nice rooftop pool. Only complaint is that it took a long time to check in. Such a busy place!,1
The walking distance from the hotel to Michigan Avenue was great... out the door and you're right there.,0
Excellent location| facilities and value. The TV in the exercise room didn't work| but that was a tiny matter. Everything else was wonderful -- including the exercise room itself.,1
We absolutley loved the location. Very easy to get to everything.,1
It was nicely located.  Easy to walk to places from hotel.,1
Staff were above and beyond professional and accommodating- Sherry is the best! Clean facilities. Complimentary breakfast. Highly recommend.,1
Overall was great jut the elevator takes too long| however it's understandable we were in 26th floor.,1
Great location! The hotel staff were great; very helpful and friendly!! Only complaints were trying to use the elevator at breakfast time was nearly impossible. Had to wait up to 30 minutes. The Other complaint was the pool: it was very small and the pool deck could use a good cleaning and a facelift!,1
Great property. Walking distance to a lot of attractions. Pool on the roof was fun at night,1
The pictures on the internet website were very deceiving regarding the hotel| pool and lobby.  When we walked into the hotel room a perfume smell was very overwhelming. The  curtains were very dingy. The hotel lobby was run down. The elevators took a long time| sometimes over 10 minute wait.  The pool area was very small and dirty. The pool deck was very slick when wet. The best part of this hotel was the location.,0
This is one of the great places to stay. Unfortunately the elevators are a disaster. We spent over 4houts waiting for an elevator. If you are staying here on business| allow an extra 45 minutes before your appointment.,1
Convenient. Rooms are nice and clean walking distance to many things,1
Staff was great| rooms were clean. Overall would recommend!,1
Staff was very friendly and helpful| room was large| clean and comfortable. Good location| everywhere I went was. $10 or less cab ride awY.,1
Staff was courteous| bedroom was clean| breakfast was nice| location is great!,1
The room was very large and the view of the city was great. One wall of the room was all windows! The bathroom too was large with great towels and amenities. Breakfast buffet was good too! We also were very pleased that while in our room we did not hear people talking in hallway| a door open of close| nor an elevator open or close that our room was right across from.,1
Check in was fast. Clean rooms. Friendly service.The phone didn't have instructions on calling the front desk| it took some fandangling to figure it out. The elevator situation was crazy - trying to get to breakfast took 15 minutes,1
The main issue is the set-up for Breakfast.  There is not enough room where the food is to handle all the people.  Beds were not comfortable as other Hampton Inns I stayed in on my trip.,1
Vacation trip to Downtown Chicago.  Hotel was perfect.  Nice big room| very clean.  Location to attractions was good.  One block from Michigan Ave.| Magnificent Mile area.,1
Wasn't impressed with the parking or the pool.the room was very clean,1
Air conditioner didn't work right.  Engineer told us to just mess with controls to get it to click on.  Not enjoyable to come into a warm room and have to mess with the controls.  Refrigerator had to be fixed as well.  Mattress was extremely worn with no support.,0
Great location!  Central to everything!  Parking was expensive at the hotel| but was pretty comparable for Chicago.,1
Needs something on the beds between light sheet and heavy comforter,1
The room was perfect for my husband and I. The view was spectacular. The location was perfect for going to the river walk to eat and shopping.,1
The shower in our room didn't work properly.  Other than that| everything else was okay.,1
Great location.  Easy to get to (as long as you don't mind city driving).  Parking is in a garage next door.  $39 per day if you take the car in yourself.  The garage attendant told us that it was $69 per day if you valet with the hotel (didn't confirm this with the hotel).  Easy walk anywhere in downtown Chicago (<30 min).  Super friendly staff.  Clean| spacious rooms.  Housekeeping straitened everything each day.  We were on the 38th floor so not too much traffic noise.  The hotel is next door to a major medical center.  Even on the 38th floor there were quite a few ambulance sirens.  Not loud enough to bother anyone.  Complimentary breakfast was simple| but very nice and generally not too crowded.  Rooftop pool and exercise rooms were cool!  Getting on the free WiFi was a bit of a challenge and you were kicked back to a login screen every night| but overall it was good.  Would stay again without question.,1
Property is centralized in the heart of downtown Chicago.  Closed to everything| all the shopping| restaurants.  The staff was extremely friendly and very professional.  We had issue with our bathtub and they fixed the problem better than how I imagined.  The hot breakfast was also great.  They have different menus every day.  EVERYTHING was beyond our expectations & imagine.  Would recommend to all the travelers out there.  We definitely will stay there again next time.,1
Overall| a good value for money hotel to stay & explore in Chicago.,1
I thought parking was included in my three day stay. Was charged $117 This should be made clear before booking. Will not be returning there again,0
I liked the location of this hotel| as it was only about an hour bus ride from O'Hare| a short walk to the pier (about twenty minutes)| and we could usually find any bus we needed with less than a five minute walk. The room was spacious with a nice desk| large sofa| and mini fridge (but sadly no microwave). We didn't have very many issues with noise at night or early in the morning so we either got lucky with quiet neighbors or the walls did a good job blocking sound. Breakfast was pretty tasty and offered a good amount of variety during our stay of three nights. My only real complaint is that getting to breakfast in the morning can be a hassle since there are only two elevators and forty something floors| but it wasn't that big of a problem.,1
Overall the location is perfect but the hotel needs many updates giving the price that is being charged.,0
The location near the clinic was great. The room had peeling paint above the bath tub.The bulb in the lighted shaving mirror was out. an electrical access door in the bathroom was open and dusty. The carpeting was worn.,0
Extremely overpriced!! Room seemed clean but very old and dingy looking. Bathtub didn't drain well and the hardware was coming off all of the bars in the shower. The ironing board was also very low to the ground when fully opened| making it very uncomfortable to use.  I'm assuming this was a handicap equipped room (which is the only explanation for the low ironing board) but I did not need this type of room| nor was I made aware of this fact upon booking. I expressed my disappointment upon check-out and all I was told was that I should contact Hotels.com so that they could let the hotel know my concerns. Not an adequate response given the amount of money the hotel made from this booking. Very disappointed in the hotel and Hotels.com for that matter. Would NOT return.,0
Celebrated my sons birthday weekend. The location| service and breakfast was great. It was clean and very comfortable.,1
The parking ü§ê,1
Staff was very welcoming.   My room was right across from the elevator| so early in the morning hours the noise of the elevator was every minute .  Therefore I was not able to rest.  Very disappointed with the location of the room.,0
The only complaint is the cost of parking. Most places we've stayed at included parking in the price unless valet parking was used.,1
The plus to this hotel was the staff was friendly and it offered breakfast. The refridge did not work in the room spoiling our food. The thermostat seemed to have a mind of it's own and didn't work right.  The hotel staff at the hotel behind us was protesting wages. This happened to be on the side where our room was located. They had drums & yelled through a microphone all day beginning very early each morning. Not the way I wanted to wake up each morning especially with the price of our hotel.,0
Overall it is good. A few cons: WiFi is very difficult to get connected; there are protesters in that area down Cambria Hotel protested every single morning from 6:30am.... very annoying.,1
Having free breakfast was a great option when traveling with 3 children. It saved us a lot of money. Elevator wait times were terrible in the morning and afternoon,1
The staff was so friendly and helpful. Our room was  clean and comfortable.,1
Staff were friendly| welcoming| and helpful; the breakfast provided was exceptional; centrally located downtown and close to shopping| attractions| and activities|some within walking distance.,1
I had no issues whatsoever with my stay. I'd gladly return to the hotel if I'm ever back in town.,1
Wonderful time and accomodations. Close to everything. I'll be back again and again.,1
The location's proximity to lmost venues and transports was perfect and the short walk to Michigan Avenue allows for quick and easy access to the magnificent mile. The rooms were very clean and the beds were most comfortable. The staff was very polite and helpful and Robert can get you a cab in a heartbeat! Top notch if you looking for something other than the Hilton.....,1
The only downside to the hotel was that the pool was outside and we could not use it because it was so cold.,1
No complaints except for a drippy faucet in the bathroom,1
Fab hotel| amazing location for shopping! The view of the Magnificent Mile is incredible. Front desk staff weren't super friendly or accommodating. I asked for a late check out as my daughter had a vomiting bug and they requested I pay a full night's accommodation. I managed to reduce the charge to 50 dollars. Despite this - I would stay here again - location is fantastic and breakfast not too bad either!,1
It was clean. Very friendly environment. Room service was good üëå.,1
Very worn out room - small and unwelcoming. Shocker -if you have a car | you will be charged a daily rate of $63.00 - that's right - sixty three dollars. You could find that kind of money for a 4 star hotel with a parking in Chicago. My recommendation - stay away from this place. Not worth of a penny of your money. Plus | it's a rip-off!!!!!,0
Arrival was at 2 AM. Hotel front desk was excellent at expediting check in process. We have a cake for the event the next day. The facility held the cake in a cooler without charge. Rooms were clean and comfortable view was fantastic. Overall a great experience for a short night at this hotel,1
Says buffet breakfast and was so small and the worst hotel breakfast| the food was so cold had to go microwave it all| had limited choices and just everything did not look good and were even out of milk first thing at breakfast. Very expensive parking($63.00)| small rooms and bathroom shower drain didn't work so as showering tub kept filling up which was hard for multiple people to get in and shower. Would never stay at this hotel again.,0
Great hotel for the price! Perfect downtown location| friendly staff| clean| and breakfast included,1
No hot water and the elevators take forever.,0
This place is in a great location| the amenities are as expected| and the views of the city are really nice. I could even see a tiny sliver of the lake. Free breakfast and WiFi are a huge plus. And the staff members are incredibly kind and accommodating| Alfredo even offered to loan me his phone charger. However| keep in mind a couple of things: 1) There are only 3 elevators for 40 floors and 2 hotels. It can take a long time to make it up and down. 2) This is a more affordable hotel which means it is FULL of folks under 25. If you don't mind them loudly returning at 2am| or retelling their escapades in the elevator (in graphics detail) in the morning that's great| if you're older and more low key| or have little kids maybe spring for somewhere more expensive to avoid them. 3) Finally| there is an ongoing protest at Cambria (north facing side of the building) and I could hear their drums even on the 35th floor. So| if you're looking for somewhere quiet this might not be the place. All in all| it was what I needed with only a few minor inconveniences.,1
Thre staff were extremely helpful. Thank you! The elevators were an issue| but all we had to do is call the front desk....they would come get us on the 34th floor!....if the wait was longer than 10 minutes,1
Exactly what I expected| nice and comfortable with no frills. I did not try the breakfast since I do not eat breakfast but the coffee was surprisingly good and the staff was excellent. Location was awesome too.,1
The elevator was insanely slow!! the first morning we waited over 15 minutes| day two someone came to get us and take us down the service elevator so we would not have to wait so long. I have stayed at many hotels in large cities for conferences and have never had to wait so long. Having to plan an extra half-hour to my morning to make sure that I could get to my conference on time was very frustrating.,1
Great location and super friendly staff! Just off the Mag Mile!,1
I didn't like the fact that the elevator was not working| pillows were dirty| tub was clogged| microwave was damaged etc,0
We found it to be a convenient location . Walk to major attractions.,1
Updated and clean.  Staff was friendly and doorman very helpful.  Just know that parking is in parking garage next door and is $63 per day.,1
This is an amazing hotel for the price. Location is perfect. 1/2 block off the magnificent mile and two blocks to the subway. Very nice room and welcoming staff.,1
Some things run down. Mostly bathroom area. Main door had gaps on both sides letting noises in.,1
I like the access to the stores and bars. It was also close to many parking Garages,1
Very nice hotel| with a great friendly staff.The hotel is literally seconds from the magnificent mile which was great..There were close restaurants around that were very good as well.I would most definitely recommend staying here..They have a room on the second floor| where you can relax| watch tv| play video games |get on a computer| or even charge your wireless devices..I would recommend staying here...,1
Our stay was great! The only complaint I had was the cost for parking!! $63.00 for our over night stay. Breakfast was alittle misleading. Our room was very nice and comfortable!,1
The location and condition of the room was excellent. The only issue was that there was not a designated floor for people with pets.,1
very helpful staff| spacious rooms| and lovely location!,1
"great experience overall : great food| location |services. the only thing weird is the cleaners always knocking in your door even though it already says "" do not disturb "" sign outside the door. They did it everyday !! its a bit annoying..",1
If going again I would ask for room on front side of building. Sat morning started at 7am with drums and a bullhorn protesting the Cambria on other side. We had a high floor and it was still terrible. Not hotels fault but rather unpleasant anyway.,1
Great location - right off Michigan Ave.,1
Quick check in| awesome staff (Especially John- so personable and informative/LOVED him),1
Nice hotel. Simple breakfast. Near to michigan av. Nearest to great restaurants,1
Lynette at the front desk was absolutely amazing. She found out it was my birthday and got me birthday gifts! Super sweet!,1
Great location. Comfy bed (firm but soft). Enough room.  Good breakfast.,1
Nice sized room in Downtown/magnificent mile area| centrally located.,1
great location I would stay there again. parking was $60,1
This hotel was in a good location and we loved the included breakfast.  The hotel room was loud| and we think it was the service elevator we could hear.  There was peeling paint on the ceiling| but the room was spacious.  Beds were comfortable and most of the staff was friendly.,1
Nice hotel and friendly staff. Room was very clean.,1
Very nice stay at your hotel. Staff was so helpful and many attractions located within minutes of hotel. I would recommend this hotel.,1
Location and parking garage attached with valet parking!,1
Location and price were excellent fir a business trip,1
Great location! Close to restaurants| shopping area.Very good breakfast| included in the price of the hotel.,1
Great location| excellent value| good free breakfast,1
Hotel was nice and the location was great also. The price was high| but  it's downtown Chicago .,1
Great hotel in fantastic location.. rooms were large| clean and comfortable. Staff were friendly and helpful. I will definitely stay here again..,1
Nice hotel. Room was clean. Common areas could've used some attention. Breakfast was good! Friendly staff.,1
Was able to check into a room upon arrival| which is excellent.Otherwise| everything was good as expected.,1
Otherwise| the hotel and staff was great!,1
So close to so many points of interest. Close to great shopping and restaurants,1
Great service! There's no room service| but the restaurant next door was a great find! Great views and room was very clean!! Plus this hotel is an Uber ride away from most popular Chicago sites!!,1
Breakfast was fabulous. Every time I asked a question| the staff was super nice. The pillows are so comfortable! The comforter was being held together by a safety pin; it looked out of place and a little offputting. But overall we had a great experience there.,1
great location| helpful staff cute jokes by elevator| nice breakfast area,1
was absolutely wonderful under what they were going thru-the people working made up for the people that wernt working so all and all - would stay there again-great area,1
First time visiting Chicago from Indy. We were attending concerts for two nights during the week and this hotel was a great choice. Close to shopping/dining and a short Uber ride to the venue. Everything was clean and beds comfy. We slept in so missed the breakfast rush that most reviews talk about. Parking was expensive but expected for the area but the fact that it was valet parking was nice. Would definitely stay again.,1
Great central location adjacent to many eateries. Homeless population is abundant in the area. There is security at the entrance as an added safety feature. The rooms are extremely small abs a very tight squeeze for a family of four. Nice gym.,1
Very slow to check in and then room was filthy.  Was moved to a new room but it was also not all that clean.   Bedding had holes in it| dust all over.  I realize because of Covid the hotel and service industry is short staffed but it doesn't sit well to pay so much for a room that isn't even clean.,0
Housekeeping was horrible.  They walked into our room at 8:15a.m. while we were still sleeping.  They came back again at 10:10a.m. and yet again at 10:50a.m.  Horrible!!!  I parked my 2019 truck using valet and when I got it back they gave it to me with a scrape down the entire driver's side from the driver door to the taillight of my truck.  The line to register took forever!!!!!  Too many people and not enough service.  The bar at the top of the hotel was amazing.  Great views and great service!,0
Staff was very quick to fix the AC in our room when it was not working.,1
Was good stay over all.,1
Staff was very friendly and accommodating,1
The bathroom needs to be updated. Shower head very old and overall very small. No room.,1
We stayed 2 nights and the stay was excellent!,1
Had a good stay | parking is pricey but overall good environment,1
Liked the location and the convenience  to places i wanted to visit,1
Hotel itself is very clean and sanitary. However| the area it is in is not the best. As soon as you step outside the lobby it makes you feel unsafe. The hotel had no room service. Very limited dining| small bakery/mini mart. Parking was not free.,1
Nice clean hotel . Staff was helpful and courteous .,1
This hotel needs an upgrade of its carpet. It looks that never has been washed. Few employees to take care of registration. Great location!,1
Clean and super comfortable,1
There is very limited personnel al the front desk| only one person. Our room looked very old| small and not so clean| perhaps due to how old the room looked like.,0
The room was not sanitized or as clean as advertised.  There was body hair in the tub| a left over wash cloth from the last customer and the provided fridge is small and not any colder than the room. The hallway carpets are filthy| at least on the 7th floor.  The staff was incredibly nice and the other amenities seemed to be in working order.,1
I like that they had security there at all times to make sure that nobody got into the hotel that didn't belong you have to show your room key when you enter every single time. I did not like the fact that they did not have a sit down restaurant they only had a grab and go with the grab and go options were great for people that were looking for that.,1
Friendly| helpful staff. Was able to upgrade our room. Had access to in/out parking but lot fills up quick so needed an alternative spot one night.,1
My stay was great!!,1
The lobby was great.  The check in was smooth.  And the room was clean.  Downfalls was there were no on site parking available and suggested close locations were sketchy to enter with children. There was no microwave in the room| so leftovers are obsolete.  The bathroom doors are translucent so the late shines through.  The only mirror outside the bathroom is on the closet door so when the bathroom light is on| the room is very bright. So hard to use the restroom at night.  Then| speak location.  On checkout my minds and I were approached for change and cigarettes.  Kids were scared.,0
The location and amenities were excellent for the price.,1
Over priced|  room too small. Too many towers| floors to remember. Parking over priced especially  cafe in lobby $4.75 for a 12oz soda  that cost $1.99 elsewhere. $4.88 for plain  milk to use for cereal. It may sound fancy|p but definitely not worth it!,0
Long lines.No Service. Everything closed.  Even ice machines off. No ice. Please don't go.,0
"I booked a standard room.  I was told at check-in that they upgraded my room - which sounded nice.  But if the room they gave me was an upgrade| I'd hate to see what a standard would have been.  The room was dark.  The bathroom was tiny (the toilet was actually in front of half of the miniature vanity (which was only about 12"" deep).  And the tiny sink was too small to even wash my face.  The water pressure in the shower was so low that there wasn't enough force to make water flow on some of the settings on the shower head.None of this is what I would expect from a Hilton.  There are plenty of much cheaper options in San Francisco if one wants a dark room with a tiny| sub-standard bathroom.",0
"The room was great| but the Staff/process at security is TERRIBLE. Arriving at the HILTON Hotel| I felt like I was arriving in a concentration camp or something| as you need to prove yourself every time you think to go out of the main entrance| even for 2 minutes. You need to show who you are| even answer questions to the security like: ""What are you doing here?"" What? Do I need to justify the reason for my trip? (As a side note| after I questioned this process they placed a bigger security guy on my side trying to put some fear on me| so I loved and pushed more to talk to the manager and asked to call the police. )TREAT CUSTOMERS WITH FEAR? NOT ACCEPTABLE!!!Also| the SECURITY IS HANDLING SENSITIVE INFORMATION IN A BUNCH OF PAPER SHEETS| like my and wife's full name (First and Last) and more details that I could not check. My question is:  ""With this sensitive information| WHO GUARANTEES that this info will de destroy after the workday? Or even if will not go to ""bad"" hands that could do some identity theft?If Hilton wants good security| should invest in an automated system that can validate identity in a secure manner and avoid any identity theft. But| handle a bunch of paper sheets to a guy and ask him to validate names? Ridiculous process!!!Not happy at all with this process and will never go back to any Hilton.",1
excellent! I will stay at this hotel every time I visit San Francisco,1
everything great except for loud construction early morning,1
Bar closed at 12:10 am and we were supposed to have happy hour 12-1. Front desk had no explanation - also wouldn't issue us tokens for the champagne machine. Date night with my husband away from our 3 kids is few and far between -  terrible.,0
Very central location| helpful reception and I got upgraded to the 34th floor with an amazing view could just about maje the golden gate bridge.,1
No free wi-fi and $50 parking were surprises| but hotel is nice.,1
Room was very clean. Housekeeping excellent. Bathroom was surprisingly small but well designed. Check in time was 3:00 PM room was ready at 5:30 PM. Keycard not working due to computer system down.,1
Allowed us to check in early morning to our room after a 5 hours flight!,1
Central Location was good.Homeless people living in the streets and sidewalks about a block away was not.,1
Excellent location. Very modern and clean. Some rooms have excellent views and if yours doesn't| go to the bar on the top floor!,1
Great location with plenty of rooms. The cityscape bar has a spectacular view in the early evening| although a bit pricey for drinks| worth a trip up the 46 floors. Mason's Diner across the road offers more choice and a more relaxed feel for breakfast.,1
everything was amazing from the staffing to  how close was union square. the only thing is prepare yourself if your staying in their parking structure to $66 a night extra. But other than thats great hotel..recommend..,1
We could not have enjoyed our stay more!  The location of this Hilton is close to great food and shopping; plus it's a nice walk to most places in the city.  The bed was incredible| comfortable and spacious.   And the noise of the city was mostly absent| a pretty uncommon thing to find in a San Francisco hotel. You should stay here!,1
The view on the 38th floor is amazing. Big rooms with big windows and automatic/motorized  shades. Downside is the check-in took a long time. The line was too long because there were only 4 receptionists.,1
Loved the hotel but the area that the building is in feels so unsafe. The streets are so dirty and feel dangerous. Next time I will book a nicer area.,1
First of all- charging $58/night for self parking is completely out of the norm. Second| guests have to wait >20 mins to check in on a Saturday afternoon. Asked the receptionist and she said that's the norm. She even said don't stay in this location at all cost. That tells  how their own people view of their work premise.,0
Took us about 25 minutes waiting in line to just check in. When we checked in| we went to our room and noticed that they put us in a room with one full size bed when I paid for a king size bed. I then called down to the front desk and the person who answered said that they were supposed to tell me that they were SOLD OUT of King size beds (what I paid extra for). The person who checked us in was the GENERAL MANAGER. She then said that she can put us in a king size bed for the next night (we stayed 2 nights) and offer complimentary breakfast for our inconvenience. Moral of the story| don't stay here on a holiday. The communication from Hilton to Hotels.com sucks.,0
We reserved 7 rooms| when we arrived only 3 were ready| I had to wait an additional 3 hours for our rooms to check in. My teenagers were falling asleep in the lobby and I didn't get into a room until 1:30 am. Terrible experience.,0
The room was nice| but I did get locked out once due to the security device flipping open when the door was closed at some point.  I had to wait 20 minutes for security to come and help get me in| but they sent up engineering to take care of the issue right away and it did not occur again.I didn't know there was a huge convention at the hotel that weekend| so it was busier than I normally like| but overall a great place to stay!,1
This was one of my favorite hotels until my most recent stay. My room was not clean specially the bathroom sink and although I was offered a different room I declined. I had being on the road for hours and the last thing I wanted to do was wake up my son to move.,0
Would have loved a tea kettle as well as coffee maker,1
Decent property at union square SFO,1
The room was smaller than expected| the pictures of the bathroom on Expedia did not match the one in the room. Really small bathroom| sink was so small that I turned on the water all the way and some of it got on me. Pretty much was a shoulder to shoulder bathroom. A lot of noises through out the whole night couldn't even sleep. The TV will change channels randomly. The bed was not a king size like I had requested was more of a queen size and honestly didn't even look like a king size will fit.,0
Great  views of the city! The only thing was the sky bar was out of food when we went there.,1
It was nice nice place to land after a long day of travel. Employees were courteous and helpful| the room was clean| and there was Coffee Bean coffee in the room.  It is was out of walking distance from the pier or the Golden Park area| but there were trolleys and bus to get there. It was central to lots of shopping and nightlife.  Get ready to spend a lot of money for parking and transportation.,1
Lobby ambience was great..staff always helpful..cleaning staff also.a joy,1
I liked that i can communicate with the staff via text message.,1
Clean and  friendly employees. Had a great stay.,1
Walls were paper thin| felt like the screaming toddlers nextdoor were in my room (all night).  You can hear all activity in the hallway including every door opening and closing. Slept terrible. Neighbor was convinced my room was theirs| probably because the concierge wrote my room number on their key.  That made for a tense and avoidable exchange.No microwave| which I found weird.  No bathtub.  Nothing to stir your coffee with.Late checkout not available| but the option of a luggage check was provided.  This was great| until I watched as the frustrated employees/attendents kicked the luggage accross the floor.  Upon return to pick up my bag I reached for my bag which the attendendant dropped onto the floor instead (cringeworthy moment for my laptop). The food shop/cafe were really great| the lobby is beautiful.  The rooms are exceedingly clean.,0
Hi we were there for a weeks vacation we want to be in San Francisco and we saw the stage play summers. Everything in the hotel was very good we had a great time and the concierge down at the desk I believe his name was I think it was meant well but I'm not positive he was very very helpful I booked a He booked a shuttle service for us when we left the hotel he was extremely helpful. Nothing but good things to say about the hotel in general I had an excellent stay in the room was very clean and well equipped. Would be happy to stay there again. Steve,1
Hotel is located in a great place. However| it's tired and shows signs of wear. Room service was however excellent.,1
It was close and walking distance to everything. Will highly recommend,1
Great get away weekend and the centrally located Hilton made it easy! Great service rooms were clean| great times!,1
I did not like this stay because everything sucked!!! And the parking is basically idiotic. How come these dumb employees know how to keep a parking place.,0
Random  alarm from smoke detector| water leaks in bathroom| Lobby extremely noisy and crowded| streets around the hotel smells urine and dotted by homeless people,0
Hotel location excellent|  got upgraded to corner suite.  staff not very friendly|  buffet breakfast not much selection,1
I like the ‚Äúfeel‚Äù of the hotel itself. My daughters and I felt safe. The lobby was welcoming and we enjoyed sitting there and relaxing,1
Having some hiccups when checking in| but associates helped to work them out. Good service! Very Satisfied,1
Room was clean and tidy| and hotel well located. Pool was closed for entire stay| however bigger disappointment was the $12.95 per day charge for internet.,1
Lovely overall.  Very comfy.  Nice location.,1
Everything was great except for the amount of dust on the end tables| headboard and other items in the room.,1
Nice Location in the middle of great restaurants and attractions..,1
Clean| excellent location. Staff is very friendly.,1
This was our 2nd year staying at the Hilton and we are always pleased with their service. It was a great stay. Looking forward to booking again for next year.,1
Very clean room. great location near to everything.,1
The Hilton was absolutely awesome for our family getaway to San Francisco. Location was great as everything was either a short walk or short Uber ride away. The rooms we had were very clean and comfortable. The best part was probably the drinks and the view at The CityScape bar on the 46th floor. Would definitely stay there again.,1
The staff made my stay especially comfortable| my first time traveling and they made everything very simple !,1
The customer service was excellent. The room was clean. Location is perfect. I recommend this hotel.,1
Very nice staff! Great location. My teenage daughters loved staying here. Used ParkMobile to find parking close by. I found their parking too expensive.,1
Location and others. Negative: lines at the desk and some clerks were roughly,1
I've had the pleasure of staying at this hotel my last 3 stays in San Francisco and each time has been wonderful. The staff is always helpful and nice. We stayed in a junior suite this last time and the room and view was perfect. I love the Cityscape bar! Definitely a must when staying at the Hilton Union Square,1
Good location. Big hotel. Near Union Square and Bart.,1
The hotel is very well run. This staff is excellent. However| there are so many people in this hotel you feel as if you were lost amidst the service component of it. When you have to set up a rope line and ask people to go through A-line in order to check in and get your Room| it feels like you are visiting Disneyland rather than entering a hotel.,1
Great follow-up with the staff| made the whole trip very easy.,1
quick check inquick check outI don't mind taking reviews but this should not have to be an area that needs to be filled out before submitting,1
Great hotel close to everything bye union square! Has great store| restaurant and bar right in lobby as well as good views of skyline!,1
I found hair on the desk by the tv. And the maid forgot to clean our room one day.,1
It was a great trip. Wish they had more affordable meal options at hotel.,1
I like the cleaness of the room and bathroom| the security in the building| the lobby area. Beside that there are rent-a-car offices and restaurants around the hotel.,1
WiFi in too. Didn't work. Else it was great experience,1
Location is great and the room was lovely!   However| the lobby is so noisy now especially with the bar and the shop| it feels like you're in a railway station.  But once away from the madding crowds it's a little quieter!,1
Great location very close to Union Square| a lot of homeless in one side of the area and sometimes they hang around close to the hotel. The room was small but comfortable| check in and check out was quick and convenient. Only thing is that is not a quiet hotel | the massive lobby is super loud  | a lot of people up and down of elevators and it can get a bit uncomfortable. If your looking for with a relaxing environment | this is not for you. a plus | the bar upstairs its awesome with great views of the city !,1
Lobby bar was a standout when first entering the hotel. The acoustics are not good| as a large conference was just kicking off and checking in was more like going to a stadium than a Hilton hotel. Overall good time and a great location to start a vacation.,1
Everything about my stay went well.  The room was great| comfortable bed| and stunning view of the city and the golden gate bridge.  The food| bar| and market/coffee options are great.  Friendly staff.,1
The front desk staff was great. The room was good with an amazing city view. The bathroom was dirty and not cleaned properly. Housekeeping was horrible and never responded to any complains.,0
Staff was room. They knocked on our door saying the room wasn't paid for when it was,0
Hotel stay was great. Price of food in hotel restaurants and stores was ridiculously over priced.,1
This is the largest hotel on the west coast. It's HUGE and can feel a bit overwhelming. We had 3 separate rooms| all small frankly. But you're sleeping| so how much room do you really need? What sets major hotels apart is their customer service. Here| the cleaning staff went above and beyond to speak to me anytime I was in the corridor. They asked what room I was in and if I needed anything. The cleaning crew and food service crews impressed me the most. They had relaxed efficiency and expressed genuine care. Anytime I went to the front desk| concierge| and doormen| I was interrupting a coworker conversation. My sister had a stroller with her and I got the doors every time. Now I can open my own door!! But we had our arms full and an assist would have been nice. The elevators are fast and I appreciated the filtered water available for dispensal. If this weren't a business trip| I would have chosen a smaller hotel.,1
Way too expensive. $200 to park for 3 days. No room service. Lobby food market outrageously expensive. $15 for a small bowl of salad| cup of fruit around $10| (maybe $8.50). Liter of water at least $10. If you're going to charge like this post it somewhere online so those of us traveling in for conferences and such can know what to expect. Will never stay here again. The conference was great but this ruined it.,0
"I did not like the markee (Union Square) in the Hilton title. Its not on Union Square. Its Several blocks to Union Square. Taylor street adjacent to the Hilton is not a recommended street to walk. Take the advice of guest services and staff; ""Take a taxi| Uber or Lyft"" to the Orpheum Theatre on Market street. Homelessness is a challenge for tourist on the streets adjacent to the Hilton San Francisco Union Square.Mike Grant",0
Loved the real music playing in the lobby| restaurant prices are crazy| bar should open at 12 not 3...,1
The hotel staff are very nice and the rooms are cleaned. Tower 2 don't provide great views of the city.,1
I like the Sky view that was online |but didnt like that the time it closed was not mentioned.  That was the only reason i choosed this location and paid more the twice the amount over the Hilton by the Airport where i stayed last month.  They should have it open for every one all day and night even though the bar is closed.,0
Staff was awesome. Ammenities plentiful. Homeless people sometimes a nuisance.,1
Great location staff plenty of restaurants and shops nearby,1
Good hotel in a great location. And Hilton beds are always very comfortable. However| the walls of the rooms are thin| so noise is usually an issue when I stay here. I have learned to bring ear plugs in order to get a decent  night's sleep here. The room's panoramic view was marred by the fact that the glass of the picture window was surprisingly filthy.,1
Small rooms that needs renovation. I thought I was on an airplane when I was in the bathroom,0
I really appreciated how close this was to the cable cars and sights.,1
Horrible check in experience. Arrived around noon & was told I could ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù & they would text me when my room was ready. By almost 5pm my room was STILL not ready. The view compensated for lack of diligence to ensure a room was ready even after standard check in time,1
Not worth the price and also not up to the standard one would expect from a Hilton.  Rooms were small| dated and dingy.  Didn't feel family friendly-more suitable to party goers.  Staff was helpful in allowing us to cancel our reservation without fee so we could change to a different hotel.,0
Our room wasn't ready until after 5:00 PM- 2 hours after it was supposed to be ready. We waited in line for 45 to check in too as there were only two people working the front desk. Was really disappointed with them as they're usually much better than this,0
Great view from topfloor bar. Jacuzzi nice| when not too busy.. plenty of pool towels. Room comfy; excellent view of parking structure. Unable to check-in at 11am| but was able to by 2:30pm. Downstairs market has limited hours| but offers good selection of snacks and seven dollar bottled water. Convenient location- close to affordable liquor store and plenty of prostitutes and homeless. Walkable to BART.,1
The property was clean and the staff were very warm and eager to help,1
This place was beyond perfect. The staff was very helpful and polite. My room was clean and perfect. And my balcony view was to die for.  Definitely will be coming back!!,1
The hotel is in a perfect place to explore the City.  The rooms are very clean and the views are spectacular!,1
This is the place we like to stay when we come to the city! It is central to everything we like to do here.,1
Has everything as it should because you pay for it. Love the gym| the pool| the coffee and the elevators.,1
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Thank you.,1
Room was dated and very very dark. Bathroom a bit dirty. Lovely breakfast though,1
The staff was very polite and accommodating. I would recommend this hotel to anyone that is visiting San Francisco.,1
We had a great time at this hotel.  It's close to all the shopping and fun downtown. The hotel itself is energetic! Lobby is always busy with a place to sit and eat and have drinks.  The cafe in hotel has everything you need.  We had an issue with our room smelling like smoke when we first arrived and they upgraded our room.  Our room was fairly quiet in tower 3 with the odd person walking down the hall late at night but nothing too annoying.  Overall| we had a wonderful stay and would stay here again.,1
It was quite central to everything. Alamo rental car office across the road made it convenient to pick up our car especially if your are not too confident at first to drive on the wrong side of the road!,1
Great location in walking distance to many places to eat,1
Not located close to union square as advertised| very close to the homeless shelters and to the streets where they sleep did not feel safe at any time of the day. Lobby very crowded and not enough employees to help you. Very slow moving line and skipped me to attend a Hilton Honors member guest even though I am also a member (and was only checking out) but did not get in that line because there was only one person helping HH members. Did not know they where going to take those guests first on the regular line :( We had a plane to catch,0
Small rooms but clean and did the trick. Check in took close to 45 minutes| waiting in long line.,0
The stay was amazing| we had a double bed room on the 38th floor with a balcony| the view was phenomenal. The rooms were super clean| the staff was very nice| i look forward to staying again.,1
Great location and services,1
Overall stay was great but the shower curtain was mildewed on the inside and dirty on the outside as well. We also did not have any wash clothes initially. Our room was on the 8th floor and faced a parking garage. Every morning there was a lot of beeping I assume from the garage across the street.,1
The check in took a long 50mins plus| I had a 2 year old sleeping on me. It was around 12 when we started the check in process.,0
This facility is in the middle of a homeless area. It is scaring to walk outside at any time of the day,0
The air con has some problems that made the air flow strange. Sometimes fresh but sometimes stuffy. 3 of my family members was unhappy with the room air quality.,1
Place was great! Our room was clean and they have a beautiful bar lounge that we live so much! Everyone was friendly and welcoming! Love this hotel!,1
Contemporary design in terms of space. Virtual (SMS) concierge is helpful and responsive. Courtyard-facing room shielded well from traffic noise. But the Loud noise of doors slamming shut by occupants of other rooms on the floor (Top floor of Tower 3) are a major nuisance; if you are looking for a quiet and peaceful sleep| not this floor.,1
Hotels.com booked me in two separate rooms| so I had to pay $50 to upgrade my room so I could stay in the same room. Hilton front desk confirmed this was a Hotels.com issue| not them. Not a great experience.,0
.From the moment I walked in| I felt like the staff was more than welcoming.  Ask for Athena| she was awesome!  Great to know they allow pets and had a great stay.  Noise level on the floors| there was none!,1
Liked the property. It was clean. Staff was nice. I didn't like that the lines to check in were so long.,1
I travel a lot for work and am happy to say this Hilton exceeded my expectations.  I knew the views would be good as it's somewhat isolated from other tall buildings| but they just didn't end.  Super happy with everything I saw and of course| the Cityscape Lounge on the top (46th) floor was incredible.  The only negative thing was that there was no parking left when I checked in and had to park in a dodgy garage across the street.  Not a big deal though.,1
Other services from checkin in to checking iut unckuding concierge were satisfactory.,0
It was a great experience. It was nice stay. Only thing is the mini fridge wasn't working so our food went bad.,1
Convenience Close to the Bart station and major brand name shopping stores.,1
Stayed 2 nights with husband and 2 teens.  It was definitely geared toward business people and seriously| DONT go west or south 1 street because the area changes considerable and is unsafe.  Staff was great and rooms were clean.  Pool is pretty lame and goes unused.  I would stay more centrally in Union Square if we visited again.  There were other hotels closer to everything which probably have what we needed.  We walked back at night twice and literally walked 1 block too far and even though we're from Philadelphia| I felt really unsafe with my kids.  Lots of homeless people in the city in general (no big deal| used to that and no one really bothers you).  But the distinct difference if you head on Van Ness or Mason is incredible.  Just too sterile and business-oriented for families.  Although the hotel itself is very nice and clean and has tons of amenities and staff is very helpful.,1
The room was quite small| but it was very clean| and the tablet to look up nearby things to do was nice. What I did NOT appreciate were all the hidden fees. $75 deposit for incidentals and $58/day for self-parking (with an additional $8 for taxes). I've been to Hiltons in San Diego right on the beach that only charge $35/day for parking. I'm appalled by $60. I chose Hilton because it was cheaper than Marriott| which I prefer| but with all the additional fees| I could have stayed at the Marriott for less.,1
Excellent service| quick| costly but everything from valet to concierge...WORTH EVERY PENNY!,1
Check out time was not clear. The cleaning should be better checked as there was a used bandaid in the shower and no towels in the room upon arrival.,1
Hotel was clean and staff friendly. Cost at restaurants expensive,1
I didn't get what I book the rooms worth| and was ask to show proof what particular room was paid for!!??? But luckily I screen shot every page on this room that i book on this web site. So they upgrade my room plus free $100 dinner voucher at their restaurant.,0
Very dirty and the staff seemed to be more attentive to the foreigners .,0
2.  The surrounding area was so filthy dirty.  I'd even say| if not for the many tourists|  it would be considered safety and health hazard.  There are sooo many homeless people.  Garbage all over.  The reason it was not that scary is because there are so many tourists around.,1
Sorry in advance| where do I start? The pillows in our room were extremely uncomfortable to sleep on and we actually left with neck problems. But we're back home now and feeling better after 1 night. The cleaning crew cleaned our room but didn't fluff our sheets| which still had some sand particles in it from our beach trip. They didn't restock us with towels and our shampoos & conditioners weren't refilled. So disappointing :( we were also situated in a room with no tub| I guess I could have asked for a room with a tub but you'd think the reservation info would have that bit covered considering a toddler was included in the booking details. Our boy had to literally sit on the concrete shower to play in the water those 4 nights we stayed. At least he was happy :) The food menus were not versatile and on top of that| overpriced. If we visit the city again we'll definitely be looking to stay at a different hotel. The only thing I appreciated really was that we were on the same floor as the pool.,0
Hilton Hotels' service lives up to its reputation and goes beyond the call. I love that u can text lame questions about how to order room service after hours and get back immediate nonjudgmental answers.,1
liked the location in respect to it being centrally located to everything around the city i wanted to see.   was shocked with the homeless population around the hotel as well as around the city,1
Proximity to the BART station was very convenient!  Easy to get around the city from here and walking distance to fantastic shopping.,1
Good hotel| in great location. Decor a bit dated. But good sized rooms| even if the shower was above the bath,1
Before using the coffee pot| always verify that it has been cleaned. Ours had mold growing in it.  Very gross.  Other than that| the only other negative is that it is located very close to the Tenderloin which is known to have the biggest homeless population around. Be prepared to have several asking for help.  It's a sad reality in every big town. If that will bother you| this is not the location for you.,1
Expensive| but no free internet. Everything else is ok.,1
Really nice hotel. Shiny and bright. Friendly and helpful.,1
I was happy until I checked out and they took over a hundred dollars off of my card.  I know the parking came off of it but the deposit on the room was never returned to my card|,0
We loved our room and the patio! The pool area was amazing and the staff was incredible!,1
Nice and big space. I got a delux room which had great view,1
Poor quality Cracked bathroom sink Loose faucet Small counter space in bathroom; feels like a studio bathroom Outdated bathroom,0
Mediocre hotel. Old| small| poorly lit room. Not particularly clean. Not worth the price. Very overpriced breakfast - $39 pp for a very average buffet.,0
However too  many homeless in the immediate neighbourhood with some litter on streets|,1
Room was not cleaned| no warmer provided in the room and room no view at all. It's not actually at time square and full of homeless in the area. Not feel safe at all. Lobby shop very expensive don't try.,0
Location|  clean| updated. Friendly staff. Liked the variety of eating options.,1
Nice great location. Easy access to Bart| bus| muni. Close to shopping malls| department. Stores and grocery. Will definitely stay again.,1
This room was perfect. I loved how they sent gifts the first day I was there!!! Super cute,1
Everything  was perfect i will stay again on my next visit!,1
Hair in the bathtub :( Otherwise it was a good experience.,1
Rooms were great just the parking was crazy expensive,1
Best location to go shopping around the city,1
It was in a great area| not far from anythingDisliked| the lack of smoking friendly areas,1
My room's view is pretty good However need to pay for WiFi and the speed is really slow,1
I loved the property| it was very clean and exceeded my expectations.,1
Great views. The Beatles stayed here in 1964 so awesome history.,1
Staff was extremely welcoming and the check-in/check-out process was extremely easy. The hotel was located in a great part of the city| perfect for a weekend getaway.,1
Very nice hotel. Great location and accomodations,1
The doorman was very rude when we were trying to come in to the hotel. Also when trying to get someone at the front desk over the phone it took over 20 min,0
It was close to the facility I was visiting. Staff were polite and friendly.,1
"The hotel is what one would expect from Hilton.  Good service but you pay for everything.  No morning coffee in the lobby here!  Our bathroom was exceedingly small and the shower did not drain very well.  That was disappointing.  Their promotional material does not mention having to pay for wi-fi in the room.  Other hotels say something like ""free wi-fi in the lobby|"" or words to that affect so that the customer will have at least a hint that there is a cost for room wi-fi.  As for the rest of our experience|it was as one can expect from a Hilton in San Francisco.",0
We were supposed to have a mobility/hearing access tub and did not receive that. We also walked into the bedroom and there was a plastic bag over the fire alarm. We were on the 9th floor. If a fire were to start we would not have a clue. Check out time was before noon and we had the cleaning service come to our door multiple times after telling them we were not leaving until check out starting at 7:30 am. Very unpleased with this stay and hotel service.,0
It was a great place for friends and family if your ever in San Fransico,1
It's very clean| everything is neat and smells good.,1
The area was a little loud outside but not bad enough to keep us from sleeping although we're not extremely sensitive to noise. The room was big and comfortable. We'll definitely be back.,1
Staff are friendly specially the gentlemen who helped us at the front desk.,1
The location is somewhat concerning.  There was plenty of security both inside and outside to alleviate any fears.,1
I liked the location of the property.  Centrally located to public transportation and touristy things.  The room size was a bit smaller than expected.  Especially the bathroom.  It would be helpful to provide more hooks or more towel racks in the bathroom.  There was no place to hang items while I was in there.,1
Clean and spacious  room but could use a shower mat. comfortable bed.,1
The location  is the best plus. The hotel is served by all kind of tourist services (bus stops| etc.),1
I stay at this hotel every year| this year was really disappointing. The room was dirty| furniture a bit tired too. It looked like someone had a food fight in the room and not recently either| there was old food splatter on the wall and not just one wall| every wall. Dried on weeks or even months ago| grim. I asked the maid to clean it on Tuesday morning| it wasn't done| I asked the front desk to clean it on Wednesday morning| the guy on the Hilton Honours desk said it would be done right away| I went out| expecting it to be done| it wasn't| I complained on Wednesday evening| when I got back| they assured me it would be done on Thursday| I went out| my room was serviced| it wasn't done| I called the manager 'DJ'| he said it would be done on Friday. It WAS done on Friday| but really| how many times do you have to ask for old food to be cleaned off the walls before it is| I can tell you| 4 times. Oh| if you use the coffee machine in the room| don't expect the maid to refresh the things you use| like the stirring sticks and creamer pots. Nearly $600 a night| this is very very poor indeed. Very poor. My 8 years of staying here is at an end. Rubbish. Oh there was also an issue with check out and the bill| which saw me wasting more time sorting something else out| that I was told would just be sorted out and wasn't.,0
Very nice hotel great location good buzz in the lobby area,1
Noisy hotel.  You could here everything in the hall.  Cleaning crew in the morning to people returning at night and early morning.,1
Great central location| although there are a lot of homeless people in the local area. The room was a bit tired looking| but generally good. Bed was very comfortable.,1
Everything was great at the hotel. The employees at the food area in the lobby were a bit rude when a line started to stack up on them. Other than that every thing went great and the room was amazing will stay here again!,1
Not any assistance for adults with handicaps. NoMuch to offer in room service,0
Expect to get nickeled and dimed for every service.  $55 daily parking| $13 dollar daily internet $4 for a cup of tea in a paper cup| $39 dollars for a breakfast for one person??  Crowded| loud| busy and impersonal.  In a not so great neighborhood where you will be confronted by SF's homeless crisis on a daily basis. Small rooms and small bathrooms.  Just a stressful stay all together.,0
Excellent hotel. Conveniently located close to the convention center,1
clean hotelgood locationgood service centrally located,1
In town to celebrate a special birthday. The only problem with this stay is although we had a great view they put us in a room that was closest to the elevator and although it did not bother us a lot at night it was noisy in the morning with people chatting as they were waiting for the elevator which woke us up early.  I typically request a room away from the elevator but obviously did not mention it for this particular stay so partially my fault.,1
Proximity to all the amenities| shops| stores| museums| entertainment| walking distance to most of the venues. A fair walk to market place| and the ferry. Good food all around it. Over all very convenient.,1
Hilton Union Square is an excellent property with very good amenities. However we were disturbed by quite a bit of Street noise during each of the 3 nights.,1
We were woken by Street noise during the night| quite a bit of yelling could be heard and we were on the 12th floor.,1
Was great| felt like I was trespassing with the security| strange for a Hilton,1
The pillow case stained. The towels stained. That's when I entered a supposingly ‚Äúclean‚Äù room.,0
Good location and staff was very friendly and helpful,1
Good location.  Great lobby bar.   Rooms are dated.,1
Like this location. Was surprised no valet curbsideOur room was surprisingly big as as the TV.,1
Hotel is fabulous. Loved the hotel itself. However| the location gave me mixed feelings. Proximity to Union Sq is a huge plus especially for shoppers| but it is also almost next to tenderloin and Mission St. Just need to be careful where you wonder.,1
Staffs are very helpful and kind. The lobby bathrooms are very dirty,1
The sole lady at the desk was really nice and friendly. The lobby was nice but the room was much smaller than anticipated. Especially the bathroom| the sink was not much bigger than in an airplane. The lighting was bad too. I would only stay here again if it was free and the only thing available.,0
Loved everything about the Hotel except the pillows.,1
Room was $140 per night but they added 12 different fees and $80 per night parking and $80 per night for balcony and that more than tripled the price.,0
Was welcomed by a staff member clearly not enjoying her role. That set the tone for the rest of the stay. After making one local phone call at a cost of $1.50 I was charged another $150 dollars on top of my $250 original holding security deposit!! I'm still waiting for $100 dollar security deposit that was assured would take only 72 working hours. I still wait 1 week later!,0
Very nice well designed rooms. Good location and walking distance to pretty much everything. This is a very busy hotel and if you are not a preferred rewards guest or whatever the service is alright/ good.,1
Friendly| very accommodating. Well located| clean. Will stay again,1
The deluxe king room was small but it served its purpose. I asked for extra blankets but they had so much static I couldn't use them. You can control the heat in the room though. But having a nice thick comforter would've been better. The location is great close to all the union square shops.,1
Great location and cleanliness.. however| the check-in process was unacceptable and some waiters in restaurants were rude. They seemed under staff and overwhelmed....,0
very nice hotel slap bang in the middle of san francisco,1
Beautiful hotel in a fabulous location.,1
Very unhelpful staff.  Not allowed to use pool or gym the day you check out.  We got in late the night before so never were allowed to use the facilities.  The hotel costs way more than other hotels and then they nickel and dime you so the bill is way higher than even that. $65 plus to park$25 per hour for late check out,0
The hotel is great| and reasonably priced; especially for the location. I've stayed there many times. Wound up with a bit of a smaller room than usual this time around. But we were only there for the night so it didn't make that big of a difference anyway. Would still definitely recommend the hotel.,1
Great location. 5 min ride to Fisherman's Wharf !!!!!,1
Ideal location,1
Not happy at all,0
We had a wonderful visit to the city it was so refreahing to come back to our hotel every day with geogeous decorations and an amazing sugar plum aroma being pumped thru to the lobby. Made us feel so welcome. The front deak staff were extremely polite offering upgrades to our room and an ice skating ticket promotion I couldn't help take advantage of. Our teenage daughter loved the comfort of our room so much she stayed in | enjoyed the free wifi| felt safe and was spoiled by her surroundings.My husband and I will defnately be back.,1
This is my favorite hotel to stay in whenever I go to San Francisco! Super friendly staff and very attentive!,1
Hire was good for the price| but $70+ for parking seems to be excessive| but may be normal for that congested area,1
The location could not have been better for us; in a safe neighborhood and convenient to everything we wanted. The hotel was clean| contemporary and well maintained with fabulous staff and great amenities. The room was scrupulously clean and so comfortable. We had a room with a spectacular view and balcony. Convenient and reasonably priced parking. We came for an overnight stay to take in the city Christmas vibe and had the best time.,1
What was otherwise an acceptable stay was marred at the very last minute by a rude front of house staff at the registration counter. Seeing as to how the queue for the regular checkin counter was extremely long| I made the decision to join the Hilton Honors queue to CHECK OUT. Literally a 15-second ‚Äúhere're the keys goodbye‚Äù operation. Got sarcastically chided by the female staff in red that I should join the regular queue and didn't even acknowledge if the checkout process was done. A hideous way to end the trip. MAKE IT RIGHT AND HAVE MORE THOUGHT AND FLEXIBILITY FOR YOUR GUESTS!,0
Unequal service rights of Hilton San Francisco Union Square due to reservation made by Expedia.,0
When your closet is bigger than your bathroom| you know your hotel is in need of a redo. We rented a 1 bedroom suite | which was difficult to find in the city| but decided on Hilton because of its well known brand. Upon walking in| the room was good size| couch| table and good sized bedroom.   I was told would have a hide a bed in the living room| but it wasn't. We had to order a roll away. The only bathroom in the room was in the bedroom area. It was SO SMALL. The shower was old| the door was like a linen closet door| not even big enough for a regular door. The closet was unnecessarily large. They only left 2 towels to use. No mini bar! In a suite? Come on!  This was way below average experience and hotel. You're better off renting two rooms at a nicer hotel.,0
I booked this stay on Orbitz.  When I checked in they told me I had two reservations.  It took some time to sort out and should not have happened.  I booked two nights and that should have been one reservation| not two.  Not sure where things fell apart| but please fix this.,1
Very impressed with the hotel. Rooms were nice and bed very comfortable.  Check in was quick and the guy that helped us was very helpful plus was able to change the bed from 1 bed to two plus put our group together in the same tower plus floor!! The little store in the lobby was outrageously over price. The bar on the 46th floor has amazing views but waiter was totally overwhelmed.  Not the best waiter. Definitely would stay again!,1
We had a beautiful room overlooking the pool area.  Rooms were cleaned very nicely each day.  Near enough to walk almost every place we wanted to go.,1
Great stay! Can't fault it at all! Highly recommend!,1
Very good location . The rooms are spacious and well maintained . Unfortunately water bottles not provided to guests who do not book direct with the hotel,1
The room was quiet and dark which was great for sleeping. The shower had great pressure| but was designed badly as no matter what you did| you had water all over the floor. The beds were a bit too soft for my liking. The room was spacious.,1
Nice property with lots of things to do in the area.,1
Nice and clean. Good location and facilities. Self parking is expensive but there are two cheaper ones across the street.,1
The staff checked us in early and everything about the hotel has been great üëç,1
The decoration of the lobby and bar very elegant with Christmas decorations| very spacious| the pool area was my favorite place. The perfect location near Macy and several restaurants| tours to various places,1
Booked a room with 2 queen beds for 8 nights. While the view is not fantastic from my room (facing a garage)| we are really happy with it as it was comfortable and nicely stocked with Crabtree toiletries & coffee bean coffee & tea bags daily. While the booking didn't seem to include wifi when I booked| I was pleasantly surprised to get wifi codes to use (very good connectivity)! There is an outdoor heated pool too. Hotel has water stations for you to fill up with your own bottle| which was a nice green touch. fast liftsWhile the hotel is just beside the Tenderloin area| I feel safe as the hotel was large and busy and you have bellboys at the door all the time. There are homeless people around the hotel but they were generally harmless and sometimes just wanted some warm food or drinks or change. If you don't have| they won't bother you either. The room can be pricey nearing your travel dates so do consider booking early.,1
Beautiful Hotel and lobby.  Loved the view from the 46 floor and walking distance to Union Square where they had the big Christmas tree by Macys all lit up.  The parking was rediculously high though.  Cost us $62 for one day! Yikes.,1
The view was amazing and I love the city| only gripe I have about the hotel. The mini fridge froze everything we put in it and there was no microwave to heat up the delicious left overs,1
Nice convenient location | close to union square. Parking actually behind hotel on different street though| so gps takes you to front which is only passenger drop off,1
I had paid for a deluxe King room with a view and got a very small room with no view to the city. The staff member advised us it was 40.00 per night to upgrade and could not give us a room because I had purchased it thru a 3rd party website. Our family members stayed at the same hotel with a standard double room got there later that evening and got a free upgrade to a junior suite with a city view for free. Very disappointed we were only there for a couple of nights on a getaway for my husband and I.,0
Great stay! Did have an issue with the room key not working when I tried to get back into my room. Was resolved with a trip down to the front desk but it did delay me in the morning by about 15-20 minutes.,1
Great location we had some great restaurants nearby.,1
Good: 1-Property is in great location 2- Rooms were spacious and clean 3 staff was friendly and supportive Bad: 1- Booked the room 2 months in advance requesting one king size bed.  Hotel initially said they could not guarantee offer through Expedia until the matter was escalated to manager and approval was granted 3- room was across a rental car parking lot with flood lights pointed directly into room- window screen did not block it out. No blackout curtains so bring your eye covers that the airlines usually supply because the whole room was lit up. 4-Pillows should be replaced by the ones Marriot uses. 5- hallways need to be updated- worn and aged.  Hotels are aging in this area including Hyatt and they're just not keeping the properties up in nice condition. 5- too many aggressive hookers outside of lobby area on Saturday evening. 6- visited rooftop bar on early Friday evening and the bar was out of two significant appetizers on a very limited menu. The vegetable platter didn't look fresh at all and appeared to be dry and defrosted- we turned it back. The appetizer menu needs work- disappointing for a place with a great view - would have stayed longer and drank longer. if there was something decent to snack on.,1
Nice hotel but no parking was avaiualble when we arrived on Saturday evening. Eventually found parking after 1 hour. Parking is also $62 overnight which is a little expensive,1
Center of everywhere| walking distance to mall. Overall grear hotel,1
Hotel made an unauthorized charge in my bill related to Lobby Bar| which I observed during checkout.  I never used the Lobby Bar at all. On request to verify and revert| the staff could not verify it at that time or could not show me the particular receipt| even after repeat requests. The hotel charged the amount to the payment through credit card.  This is really unprofessional and a type of cheating.  Very bad from a brand like Hilton| especially when the staff says that they cannot show the particular receipt to the customer.,0
Overall a good stay in the Hilton Union Square. Rooms dated but clean. Location ideal with Powell Station less than a 5 minute walk. Cityscape was fantastic for a drink whilst admiring the city during sunset. The small shop in the reception area was extremely overpriced so found one of the many Starbucks nearby. San Francisco has a real problem with homelessness. Reportedly over 7|000 which did not go unnoticed. Most on drugs which became comparable to a zombie apocalypse. Countless times we were approached by those begging for money| not just on the street| but whilst eating dinner| on public transport and even in shops. Police do not seem to care. Felt very unsafe to go out alone in the dark as a young women.,1
Great location for all requirements. Easy access to BART for extending travel outside the central SF area.,1
I wasn't there long but staff seemed friendly| hotel was clean and nice lobby. Close to shopping but area can be a little sketchy at night.,1
Great trip. Cozy hotel. Excellent view from our room.,1
Highrise in heart of Union Square. Everything you need/want nearby. In room coffee pretty good. Anything you want to eat within blocks. Clean| nice sheets and fluffy towels. Free WiFi if you're Hilton Honors member. Parking is tight. Was forced to valet park as available  parking spaces were too small for our small SUV. If you have one bag| park across O'Farrell at public parking| cheaper and very convenient to lobby.,1
Great place!  Easy walk to numerous eateries| shops and attractions.,1
Very nice hotel! Hotel is in very good condition and close to everything. We did not get a chance to try the restaurant but I guess it is good as well. Definitely will book again next time when I am in Austin. On complain is the fan| it is a little noisy and I can turn it off.,1
Everything was great except that the cost of parking your car was $60.00 a night. A little expensive to say the least. I think if you are a hotel guest that you should get a better rate. We even parked in the garage connected to the hotel. So beware of the high extra charges,1
I don't like it when someone knocking on the door at 8:30 just to drop a receipt under the door. It interrupted our sleep considering we slept really late and wasn't able to get back to sleep:(,1
Nice hotel| clean| friendly staff,1
Close to Downtown and attractions plus the public transportation,1
Good solid large hotel| not more not less,1
I paid for a suite with a sitting area and the room didn't have a sitting area and the it was next to the elevators and we didn't get any sleep cuz of the noise.  The hotel moved us to another room which was a lot better| however it was still dirty from previous occupant.  They ended up cleaning it and offered us breakfast.  The last night was fine however the refrigerator died in the night and all of our food was spoiled.  We've stayed there a few times before and enjoyed it and this was my fianc√©'s 40th bday weekend and it was a horrible experience.  I even called twice to ensure everything was good and notified them it was his birthday.  The hotel tried to make the situation better but we waisted a lot of our time trying to get our situation fixed.  Very frustrating.,0
Nice hotel in a bad city.  I was accosted and abused by mentally ill people several times just outside the hotel.  I would not recommend anyone stay there for that reason.  It's dirty and dangerous.,1
Very central!  Easy walk to Chinatown and plenty of sights to see.  Hotel was very nice and the staff was professional.  Would go back.,1
Great location - excellent roof top bar (Cityscape). Pool area needs a little more character.,1
Older property but very comfortable. Quiet rooms| good location,1
Parking and hotel rate is overpriced. Way overpriced,1
Good location| nice modern room. Room was ready early which was a bonus.,1
I was at a meeting but found the hotel convenient and comfortable,1
The room felt a little cramped. Not much clearance between the end of the bed and the room furniture.Most awkward is the narrow lavatory sink front to back. I am a mechanical consulting engineer. I found this narrow sink extremely frustrating.Lastly| I found the length of piping between the control valve and the shower head annoying and a wasteful of water. The shower| controls and trim are defiantly attractive and novel. They are not water conservative. I know Hilton can do better on the next phase of remodel/modernization.,1
The hotel is not in a good area| if you are travelling to SF on holiday I would not recommend staying here. It is in the tenderloin district. The hotel lobby was heaving with people all the time| at some points the queue for check in was 40 people long. We were given a room which was marketed as a ‚Äúsuite‚Äù but was actually part of a suite but with the adjoining doors locked. We slept on a camp bed and despite asking to be moved to the room we had booked we were told it was fully booked so we had to stay. The staff were unaccomodating and there was no soundproofing. The breakfast buffet was $39 or there was a v expensive hotel shop where you could buy yoghurt and granola for $10!,0
great for business! i got the suite for the price of a regular room.  Suites are located furthest from the elevator| and the stairs are very easy when navigating between floors,1
Room was not cleaned and when I called and left message- no one called me.  Overall service - not that great. Thanks She,0
The hotel locked is out of our room a might early so when we arrived back at our room to go to sleep| we couldn't get in and had to handle the ordeal to be let back in to our own room!,0
Beautiful facility great location and friendly stass,1
Booked a king bed online when we arrived they gave my husband a double queen and said they were all out of king. My husband said the room was below average.,0
Everything was perfect and nice! Great location great sttaf,1
Not what you expect for a hotel in the city. Bad experience our last night| just beware that rooms are allowed to dial out to different rooms without approval from the front desk. I would recommend you stay else where.,0
I have very good service very clean the room very comfortable,1
Very accessible to Union square and Market street(nordstrom Rack and westfield mall).  Many good places to eat nearby| just across The corner there is also a small grocery Store.,1
I love San Francisco. Hotel is great but the Wifi is not.,1
Parking coast to much in there garage 62 dollars wow,0
Everything! Great staff from front desk to the herb and kitchen (especially Chester!) lovely rooms and so close to everything. Would recommend and come back again!,1
Great service. Good location to walk around.,1
Great hotel.  Pool and hot tub closed at 9| seems pretty early to me. This hotel is pretty close to the Tenderloin area which should be avoided!  Market in hotel was pretty pricey| $5 for a 20 oz pop. Bar at the top of one of the towers has a great view.,1
I booked this hotel as the description said Union Square. Very Misleading. Hotel itself was okay. The staff were friendly| the room was adequate and clean. However| I would NEVER stay at this Hilton location again as 1 block left of the hotel is probably the most dangerous| disgusting (feces everywhere)| and drug addict infested ghetto in the city of SF (neighborhood called Tenderloin). Never in my life have I seen such conditions... Travelers Beware!!,0
Real nice amenities| room  too far from elevator .Room was big.,1
Great location and friendly staff. Restaurant and stores are overpriced IMO so if you just want coffee| head to Starbucks 3 min down the street,1
Centric and all around services and food. Very clean,1
The best area to stay in San Francisco. The hotel has all the services you will need.,1
Stay every year at this Hotel! Didn't let us down. Great location| clean room. Great view.,1
Had very high expectations from the Hilton Hotel after staying at it in Eilat Israel.,1
Really great access to public transit and great central location for touring around. Would recommend providing free internet without having to sign up for a program| at least in the lobby.,1
The service was impeccable.  Every member of the staff was warm and welcoming.  The atmosphere was very inviting. Great place to just hang out and meet new friends.,1
Do not stay here. Over priced| run down| terrible staff and a bad neighbourhood. I had to stay here for work and will never do it again. The hotel is run down| it was loud and the halways were filthy. The staff is grumpy| the check in line was beyond ridiculous and the neighbourhood is dangerous (they put security guards on all the doors - you cannot safely go out for a walk). Do not stay here| there are so many better options.,0
Great location. View from the bar on the 46th floor amazing.,1
Large clean rooms| well located,1
Wonderful experience at the hotel. Staff was friendly and very helpful. Would help if the hotel was two blocks east - neighborhood nearby has tons of homeless.,1
We had a bit of a wait to check in. We had reserved a room with king size bed. When we got to our room| it turned out to be a double bed. We had to go back downstairs| wait in line again to get our room changed to king size bed. Other than that hassle| our stay was pleasant.,1
Hotel was nice.  Food and drink in hotel lobby was overpriced.,1
The water pressure is a little weak in the bathroom and takes a long time for it to heat up. Room was not available when we arrived to check in. They advised that they would upgrade to a room that was available. The next morning they wanted to charge for the upgrade. Advised that I did not agree with paying for the upgrade. They ran my card with for the $50 security deposit and advised that they would be putting it towards the cost of the upgrade. Will not stay there again,0
The hotel has everything you need on the premises - restaurants| room service| business center (great for printing out tour passes)| a convenience store... It's location is also great. You're within short walking distance of public transportation (Bart| cable cars and Muni). The Pinecrest Diner is open 24 hours a day and is a block away. The Big Bus tour company picks up folks on the Mason Street entrance of the hotel. Super convenient. Our only note is that the rooms have glass doors for the bathroom. They're completely frosted so you can't see in| but the light still comes through. So if you have to use the restroom in the middle of the night and switch on the light in the bathroom|  the bedroom fills with light| too. Not great for the person in be still trying to sleep. A regular door would probably make more sense.,1
took over one hour to get a hair dryer,1
Hilton did not disappoint this trip. Spacious room and friendly staff made this weekend enjoyable.,1
I was disappointed and misled by Expedia's advertising. I doubt this is a 4 star hotel. It is old| dirty| extremely busy and not comfortable. I would not recommend this hotel.,0
Waiting too long to check in and out. Terrible,0
Nice good and clean,1
they didnt clean the room and the bathroom is small,0
Good location and good service.,1
Great hotel| we got a room at the 37th floor with a great view!,1
bad value for money| the room was old and dirty. other hotels are situated better in SF. would not go again.,0
Nice hotel but rooms are a little old looking. Placed very central. Lots of homeless people in the eastern direction though.,1
It was great that there was a baggage drop. Very nice facilities and great service.,1
Very good hotel| clean and amazing location.,1
The location is good where is near to the main shopping area| easily to get food and I love the cafe in the lobby. The reception is very efficient and the room is great! I enjoy the stay there very much.,1
The beauty,1
Overall. Good experience| would recommend.,1
The shopping was within walking distance,1
My stay at the Hilton Fairfax was excellent! The property exceeded my expectations and the guest services team was very friendly. I would highly recommend a stay at the Hilton Fairfax!,1
Loved the facility,1
Good Location on Route 66,1
Very clean great staff. Only complaint is the pool was closed. We specifically chose this hotel so the kids could swim. There was no mention on the site that the pool had been closed for over a year.,1
Parking was easy| elevators were fast and efficient (I was on the 10th floor)| staff was efficient and the space of the room was great. No daily cleaning service due to covid (unless stay a week or longer but that was fine by me.,1
The property was well lit and parking felt safe. Hotel was clean and staff was friendly.,1
On check in discovered room was dirty and not made up; unsanitary conditions; indifferent attitude from from desk ast condition of room; had bites all over my back after night in bed: when I came to get the car out of the parking garage it had been keyed and scratched all along one side,0
It was a good experience but the breakfast was not good.  If anyone wants to book this hotel book it without breakfast.,1
Beautiful hotel| clean and the staff were very friendly and accommodating. Will definitely stay again!,1
Facility was very clean and ‚Äúsanitized‚Äù. Staff was pleasant and friendly. Problem (broken refrigerator in the room) was handled quickly. Location was good. I would stay there again.,1
Amazing stay. The front desk representative was very kind| friendly and accommodating. He upgraded us and provided an exceptional service to us. We will definitely stay at this hotel anytime we are in Fairfax.  The hotel is perfectly well located. It's very clean and well maintained.,1
The hotel room was really niceIt was spacious at the end of the building with a nice outdoor view,1
No person in front desk and call them many times to ask service. But they did not pick up phone call| and anyone help us. So bad hotel,0
Was upset that the pool was not working‚Ä¶ wished that would have been listed or known prior to booking. The building felt understaffed| room AC made noises all night long and overall just wasn't pleased with this stay.,1
They didn't have wash clothes and when I asked lady got attitude. Manager did apologize and said they were going thru changes.,1
Not so friendly staff. Room cards didn't work so a member of the staff had to take us to our room every time‚Ä¶ the room wasn't clean. Dirty hotel. Horrible,0
The staff is rude and lazy. One day I called for 8 hours before someone answered and still said can I put you on hold? I told them no| as all I wanted to do was extend my check out. We asked for plastic spoons for dinner; they said if we can wait| they will bring it up; otherwise| we must come down and get it. We said we'd wait| but the spoons never came. I kept calling| but no answer AGAIN. I would not stay at this hotel again. I'm not sure how they are so busy. Pros: Lots of parking| pet friendlyCons: Rude Staff| Lazy| Rooms are dirty and dusty| no one answers the calls,0
Wonderful stay. Beautiful grounds| professional staff| clean and spacious.,1
The room was clean and spacious.  It seemed like a great value for the price,1
Dirty| dirty| dirty! Looks to me that the carpets both in corridors and rooms are rarely vacuumed. We had an adjacent rooms and both of us suffered from bug bites. Awful!!!,0
The hotel did not follow covid protocol Not enough staff to handle this size of hotel,0
I really liked the lay out of the rooms. The room was split into a living and sleeping area separated by a wall and television that swivels to either side.  Only complaint about the rom was there was a constant drip in the sink which was quite loud.  Great location and plenty of parking.,1
Check in was easy. Rooms were great. Stylish| clean| spacious. Had booked two rooms with two queen beds| but when we arrived| they didn't have any together on the same floor. Switched us to double beds. The rooms had a mini living area with a pull out couch and chaise. Tv could turn from living area to,1
"This was my first time staying in Fairfax and Hilton did not disappoint. I had a king room and it was very spacious. I really enjoyed the additional seating area! The bedroom and bathroom were very well cleaned. I stayed during COVID and the staff was very accommodating even though room service was not frequent. I was here for business and felt it was a great ""work from anywhere"" location as I am an entrepreneur. Instagram: @DemetriaScenie. I'd definitely stay here again.",1
We were welcomed and once the staff knew we were looking at colleges| we were given a fabulous upgrade to a suite with an amazing view!,1
Love the hotel.,1
Staff friendly & helpful. Quiet.,1
Although limitations using common areas due to COVID the room was completely cleaned. Excellent service!,1
Staff was very nice. Rooms were very clean. Hotel was also quiet and orderly.,1
"I regret to say that this was a very disappointing experience. The front desk reception upon arrival was very professional and pleasant. The room was just okay: the furniture seemed worn; bathroom sink made a loud drain noise; vents on the AC could not be adjusted to where they stopped blowing directly at where I was attempting to sleep; and| my room was on the sunrise facing side of the building which caused a loud crackling noise as the sun hit the building facade. Unfortunately| after arriving after midnight the first night and keeping my ""occupied"" sign out until about 10AM| I missed the first day's room cleaning.  I spoke with the cleaning service later that day and said that the remaining three days of my business trip I would greatly appreciate house cleaning's service:  for the next three days| I left a cash tip and a note on the bed thanking house cleaning (as I do each day every day I travel)... and no house cleaning showed up.  Lastly| the elevators were dirty with stains and streaks.  It just seemed like this hotel is starting to fall into neglect - as I have stayed at it in the past with dissimilar results.  Sorry to see this hotel fade.",0
This was a short stay with limited time at the hotel| by design. The room was clean| modern| and had the amenities our family of five required. The value was terrific.,1
Not up to my expectation.. we didn't enjoy the stay much!,0
Location was perfect| the hotel was quiet| staff was very hospitable. Highly recommend!,1
The staff are very helpful and accommodating. The place was clean and quite. I would stay here again. The only downside is the pool being closed.,1
Will stay here in the future!,1
It was a great hotel. I stayed here bc of work but I have stayed at this hotel multiple times with my spouse. I have never had a bad experience here. I will definitely come back.,1
I really liked the layout of the room with the TV in the middle| it was quiet & the large lobby was nice for sitting and chatting with a friend (since bars are closed now),1
Isolated No viewsThought that I would have a viewBar closed at 8:00!!,1
Check in was friendly and smooth| room and bed were very comfortable.  Great location| close to restaurants & shopping. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay!,1
Good stay| only one night but everything was great!,1
My two-night stay at Hyatt Regency Fairfax met expectations given Covid restrictions. Most importantly  the bed was very comfortable and the TV selection was satisfactory.,1
This hotel is conveniently located| well appointed and very clean. Staff is helpful and friendly. Rooms are spacious and quiet.,1
The hotel was good but the breakfast was until 8 and the parking paid the room was noise from the elevator and I stay for 6 days and they don't clean the room daily and the counter people's were rude,1
We came for 3 nights for a funeral. While the hotel was beautiful| the lack of things i am used to| were not exactly there. I do realize we are in a pandemic| so limited guests.The staff that was present| were awesome| & friendly.Main things:With 20% capacity| & the parking lots mostly empty| i was still forced to pay $8 a day for our car.Having to leave at 7 for the Arlington funeral| there was noone| & no way to at least get coffee| coffee should be accessible.With the hotel having only 20% capacity| i saw no need to put people in the adjacent room| who were very loud| fighting| & slamming doors late into the night. Guests could have been separated.The courtyard for sitting to have coffee| was littered with cigarette butts| that's on guests who refuse to use the smoking polls| but should be cleaned.Again| beautiful facility| & despite the virus| people who do stay| & pay should expect more.,1
Rooms are clean.  Covid precautions are being observed.   Good location.,1
It was a great local vacay and it was very relaxing and the view was amazing and incredible.,1
Nice hotel rooms but the customer service was not good. The staff was very slow to address issues that came up.,1
Nice hotel that is very clean and comfortable.  Only drawback is that there is a hotel parking fee and service can be a little slow.  Otherwise| great location that is convenient to many things.,1
Convenient location| nice view- very comfortable-,1
Great hotel for great price!,1
Very nice and classy place,1
This is a beautiful property but just so sad to not see it at its potential due to Covid-19....no housekeeping| hardly any staff| etc...,1
What a great place to stay! Convenient to lots of shops| food| entertainment and all the major highways. I would definitely recommend it and will return the next time I'm back in Fairfax.,1
Check in was the only issue I had with this place. Everything else was great.,1
the hotel is good and location is good but they have parking charge of $8/day/vehicle.,1
This is a nice hotel.  Loved the area and the hotel decor itself. I prefer Firm pillows but would definitely book again.,1
After  I checked in I had to leave so | my sister came back and because the room was not clean they had to give us new room and I didn't know they gave my sister new roomHer phone was off so I tried to call her through the hotel phone and the guest service refuse to transfer my call to the she was in. The guest service told me I have to have ID how can I provide ID through the phone.,0
Beautiful room and hotel,1
Very good hotel. Great view from the room| large| accommodating| spacious. If not for the corona virus impact on housekeeping and facility usage i t would have been perfect.,1
Room was very clean and spacious for my boyfriend and I quarantine get away ! Do recommend,1
We only stayed one night in our room| late arrival and early departure| we would like to say that our beds were,1
The hotel was amazing!! Had the time of my life the 3 nights we stayed,1
The property bar restaurant amenities were closed because of the corona virus pandemic| so my rating was a middle straight no smile.,1
Overall the hotel was pretty good. I had plenty of towels & wash cloths. My commode ran a few times| which means something was leaking| but that wasn't a huge deal. The seating areas were too low for my taste. The staff was friendly & professional. I would definitely stay there again.,1
This was a great hotel and I loved my room. Clean| roomy| comfy. Loved the adjustable TV mounted on the wall so I could watch from the couch or the bed.,1
This is a staple whenever I need a hotel clean. Great location. Friendly staff.,1
The staff were very friendly and accommodating.  My food was delivered in a timely manner.,1
I ordered breakfast with room and my only complaint is they don't have a system i.e. coupon or voucher to let the kitchen staff know that breakfast is included for a guest.,1
When we arrived| They didn't have our requested room type. Front desk clerk then proceeded to (1) lied and said property did not have rooms with 2 queen beds which we knew wasn't true because we had been in that type of room on the property 2 months earlier and  (2) refused to make any financial compensation for our smaller accommodation.  She was very| very nasty.  Later| another front desk agent called us and tried to make amends by giving us another room. However| the original front desk person had destroyed our feelings about Hyatt service and staying at any Hyatt in the future,0
IT WAS GOOD TIME,1
This hotel was very spacious|  comfortable and clean. The price was low| but they charge an extra hundred dollars for having a pet. If I would have known that it was a charge and not a deposit it got back I would have looked for a different hotel. With that hundred added on it made the price the same as other more expensive/nicer hotels.,1
Facility was cleanStaff was very helpful and friendly,1
I have stayed at this hotel several times now. Each time I am impressed with everything that is meaningful to me as a guest: Friendly staff| very clean room| lobby| hallways| etc. Of all the other Hyatt Regency hotels I have stayed at throughout the country| this one impresses me the most. Excellence in every category. Well worth a few dollars more to stay at this location. Well done - complements to the entire staff and management.,1
Very quiet| even with a holiday party going on. The staff were all very friendly and helpful.,1
Great customer service| friendly front desk and easy check in.,1
Its a good hotel. Everything went good. A good amount of space inside and outside the hotel.,1
It's clean with good amount of space. It's also very close to many stores,1
Great but the fridge didn't work and the lamp plug kept coming out if the outlet. But I did enjoy the room.,1
Stayed here while visiting family over Thanksgiving. We were upgraded at check-in without our asking‚Äî‚Äújust because|‚Äù‚Äîand the room was superb. Everyone on staff was friendly and helpful| despite having to work over the holiday. This is our new go-to hotel in the area. We will absolutely return. Thank you!!!,1
I liked to clean room and widly parking lot. Kindly staff,1
I paid $165 a night this hotel worth only $80 a night.,0
The grounds were well kept| the room was spacious and clean as well. The staff was friendly and willing to go the extra mile.,1
"The hotel was beautiful| comfortable and the amenities were more than expected. The staff was kind| respectful and very professional. Breakfast was great and of good quality. I highly recommend this hotel. However| I had a bad check-in experience that made me very concerned about my confidentiality and the security of my documents. As I arrived in the hotel and approach the check-in staff at the counter in order to check-in. I said ""Hi| I am here to check-in|"" the staff member said: ""You are already checked-in| a lady checked-in for you| saying that you are her daughter| and she provided your ID."" I knew that information could not be correct. I live in New York and my mother is not around and noone else has a copy of my ID. I am very concerned about this that the staff allowed someone else to check in under my name| who was not me. We drove in from NY to VA to find out that this occured| made me worry the entire time of my stay about my account| and the entire situation.",0
The property has a very nice lobby area and clean room,1
Great for the price..really modern and clean we got a room with a nice view,1
Room had everything you need| close to everything and clean.,1
Front staff people wee great and bistro people were awesome,1
I had a $15 food|and beverage credit that I was encouraged to use by the hotel staff at coffee shop before checking out.  Instead od using that credit| the hotel charged me for that purchase.  I will no longer be visiting the Hyatt Regency Fairfax.,0
The property was beautiful and the staff was pleasing the only thing was a small incident occurred. On every trip i make| I take my own bath towel| this time my bath towel was white with pale gold patters and the cleaning staff took it maybe thinking it was the hotel's property since the hotel's towels are white. It was a brand new towel payed $18.00 for it| I did try leaving a note for the cleaning people but nothing was done.,1
Great location and helpful staff that gave me a great view!Take in room service was perfect!,1
It was a great stay! Hotel was great no issues| would definitely stay there again!,1
This location was perfect for our plans on this trip. The check-in was smooth. The room was large and clean. I will stay here again.,1
Love everything about this hotel. Except| the free and paid wifi are very sub par. 1 mbps free and 3 mbps paid.,1
The property is in a great location| very clean and the room is comfortable. The breakfast was nice as well. We were only disappointed to find out that the crib we requested in advance was not available the first two nights of our stay.,1
The entrance looked a bit dated and run down.  Otherwise the facility looked good.,1
hotel was overall nice just found some stain spots on my linen and they dont change the linen every day unless you ask and even then not guaranteed. wifi didnt work for me either,1
"The hotel was very clean and easy to navigate.  The staff were extremely friendly and very accommodating.The only issue that was detracting from the hotel was the pool itself.  The gym and the surrounding area was excellent| but the pool seemed to have ""patches"" instead of actual fixes and the slight cleanliness issue.  However| the pool was heated and otherwise pleasant to be in.Definitely a highly recommended hotel and would most certainly be booking accommodations there in the future.",1
I would definitely stay here again| if I was in the area. But I will check there hotels now.,1
The room was nice and clean.  The employees were helpful and courteous.  It was a great experience.,1
It was clean| comfort and kind place with good price! I'd stay here again and recommend to friends and families.,1
It was very nice| only complaint is that the cleaning people did not throw away trash in the room.,1
Very nice. used pool everyday. convenient location,1
Maybe a complimentary breakfast instead of an expensive bar and grill?,1
Great room ! Awesome staff will use this hotel when traveling in the area !,1
Apon arrival the exterior look good but the bathroom sink was broken,1
Staff was professional and very friendly and helpful. However| parking is confusing | and the destination chargers not working.,1
Nice hotel| recently renovated in a nice area close to alot of shopping and resteraunts...,1
Great breakfast buffet. Clean hotel. Good location with shopping mall next store.,1
The staff member at reception was very welcoming and chose the perfect room for me. It was spacious and clean and the bed was very comfortable.,1
Hotel is great. Couches in the lobby could use cleaning as in you may not want to sit on them. Nice atmosphere though.,1
Surprised about the daily parking fee... but pleasantly surprised the front desk person waived the fee.,1
Fantastic value! Clean room| great space. Will definitely stay again.,1
Close to shopping and restaurants. Easy access to highways,1
Very friendly staff.    Room was fantastic.   Spacious| clean| and had lots of natural light.   Would definitely stay there again.,1
This hotel is very nice for family who has little children. Room is very cozy and amenities are great. One of the best hotel around this areas.,1
we've stayed at the Hyatt at Fair Oaks a couple of years in a row now. Wonderful.,1
I signed up for a hotel membership. There are mplace places,1
The maid service was excellent.  All the staff were very helpful| tending to all of our needs.  I will recommend this hotel to all of my friends.,1
Very nice upgraded room and exceptional staff.  The view was awesome and nothing could have been better.,1
Very nice hotel! Staff was extremely helpful and courteous| check-in/out was efficient. Restaurant was small with a limited menu| but breakfast made up for that in a separate dining area. There are many options to dine near the hotel. Our rooms were clean and up to date| set up almost like a mini suite. Bed was comfortable but the couches could be better(maybe some more pillows?) My wife noted that it was very quiet in our room| we were not disturbed in any way. We had some bad weather go through and it disrupted the satellite TV reception. Guest Wi-Fi functioned adequately| got a bit slow at times. This location was important to me as it was between Washington and my wife's family to the west. Overall| a good choice.,1
"It was a pleasant experience except housekeeping. They knocked on the door around 8 am. If you forgot to put ""privacy tag' on the door| then they would keep knocking a half hour later. The swimming pool needed a little work but not that bad. Except these| the service| cleanness| and location are great! I would like to visit this hotel again.",1
Smells old and dirty.  Also Wi-Fi did not work.  Staff could not assist with wi-fi.  Bathroom small and towels were old hard and worn.   The premises is not what is expected from a Hyatt Regency,0
Location was very good. Near shopping and nice restaurants. Staff was very helpful. Our second night when we came in we saw a lot of bus's but I must say we never heard a thing all night. I would highly recommend it. It is a 5 star,1
Our room was very clean & the service was wonderful.,1
They didn't have any King Bed at that time so my and my fiance got a double queen bed? I expected more from this hotel. Also the bedsheets were not so clean. Overall I'm not happy relating this complex.,0
"The hotel was very nice with a great location. The check in was done pretty quick with the staff missing information to tell us. I asked about the restaurant and 2 free breakfasts included. The Front Desk clerck said that they don't do free breakfast. I had to take my reservation copy out and showed him where"" 2 free breakfasts ""were included in room price. Then he looked in his laptop and saw it and he said "" I guess you do"". Breakfats was great. The room was very nice| clean and comfortable. Love the rotating TV. The gym was big and machines were easy to understand. Went a few times with my kids to the pool| but it had a sign that maintenance was been done. Never saw anyone doing anything or there was never anyone at the pool doing any work for 3 days.During checkout I showed my breakfast receipts| as I was told by the servers at the restaurant so I would not be charged| and she said "" I don't know why they told you that. You didn't have to do that:. Maybe there needs to be a bit more communication between departments. Overall it was a great and pleasant stay. Thank you!!",1
Great hotel| room was quiet| clean and comfortable,1
We hope one day the L-shape sofa will be reupholstered with softer fabric.  We will stay at the Hyatt Fairfax again.,1
They use highly odiferous cleaning products and the windows are sealed so there is no way to air out the room. They tried but it still made me ill.,0
The room was great and comfortable. The breakfast was amazingly good and the indoor pool was the perfect temperature.,1
So I have stayed in this hotel before and the initial check in was nice. The hotel is set up funny so the main door and lobby are in the back of the hotel but it wasn't a big deal. They had a nice bar that serves very good food although the bartenders aren't very friendly. Now| as for my stay| if it wasn't one thing| it was another. I got a call early informing me they had a leak and had to turn the water off. I got up and took a shower only to have them come to my room to physically turn a valve off and was informed they would be back once they got it fixed to turn it back on| which was extremely annoying because I had conference calls I needed to take. In addition to that| in the middle of the night| my card I had used for the incidental fee (which was taken out as soon as I arrived per every hotel I had ever visited) was charged| or as they said| had made another hold for an odd amount- $235.76. It threw me off because it was such an odd charge and they never could tell me what this mystery hold was supposed to be for and was a large chunk of money I had not set aside for the trip so it put me in a bind during my trip. A week later and the hold still has yet to be released and they still won't let me talk to a manager to see why it was ever made in the first place or when it will be released. Overall I will NOT go back to this hotel| the workers were shady and apparently make mystery charges on your card and hope you don't notice.,0
Close to shopping| food| and everything. Parking is not free| which is the only down side there.,1
Perfect location. Room was spacious and clean. The people were friendly and helpful.,1
Great room| spacious and clean| courteous staff| seamless visit,1
We stayed 5 nights and even added one more night we were having such a great time. The room was clean and comfortable and the service and staff were great. My only wish is that the hotel would keep the large groups of students on a separate floor from families with sleeping children.  Two nights we had interrupted sleep due to teens running up and down the halls until 1-2 am.,1
Location was great. Clean and professional staff. Close to anything you needed.,1
Great location and amenities.  Would stay there again.,1
Overall really nice hotel with friendly staff. Room was not cleaned one of the days I stayed. But good hotel with nice amenities.,1
Good location but everything was not satisfied .  Too small room| no extra pillows and blankets for the third person and terrible breakfast,0
The breakfast was delicious and all in all| we would definitely go back.,1
A first time stay at Hyatt Regency| but a very pleasent stay. Great bed| great size of room and friendly staff.,1
Clean and nice,1
Always nice staff and clean and contemporary rooms,1
Always love the Hyatt!! Beautiful facility and wonderful staff.,1

The room was clean and comfortable and the location was perfect for all of the activities that we had planned.,1
I liked that the property was spacious and had a bar and a lounging area in the lobby.,1
The staff was very cordial and welcoming. The front desk was very helpful and gave accurate information.,1
Welcoming and helpful staff| beautiful room| comfortable bed| and great breakfast options.,1
Yes I recommend and good customer service,1
This hotel is very clean and the service is excellent.Roji is super. She always making sure you are comfortable and you get a great service!Rosa and Adela at the restaurant are awesome!!All the personnel is great.,1
The rooms have division of the sitting and the sleep area.,1
Great location for being able to travel to various meetings.,1
Its wounderful  nice location helpful staff grat breakfast its worth it i checked in 19 dec checking out dec 26  heading atlantic city then I rechecked in hyatt on 28 dec,1
Great Customer service| we were upgraded to a lovely room. It was a quick stay for us| but much appreciated. We will be back| thank you!,1
Love the Hyatt brand.  Hotel was comfortable| affordable| clean and rooms were stylish and accommodating.   Service with the staff is outstanding!,1
I was charming| lovely large room| great bathroom and the heat worked well for such a cold day.,1
Room service is bad and the cleaners are not helpful. I stayed for three nights and the room was cleaned once. Body wash| soap| and towels were not replaced. I booked double queen beds and was given a king room. The receptionist said it was my mistake. He did not apologize when I showed him my booking confirmation. It took them 40 minuets to fix this mistake.,0
The property is very nice on the inside| great common areas and nice rooms.  High ceilings everywhere.  Good food at the restraint.,1
Have used this hotel several times for business. I've never been disappointed.,1
The hotel was Nice the lobby is beautiful. I was a bit dissspounted with my room becsuse it seems way smaller than pictured. It definitely was the square footage quoted. But beside that it was good.,1
nice hotel in hreat location for shoppong and food. Did not use facilities so cannot comment on that but room was large and very clean.,1
Upgraded our room for free to the panoramic view! It was amazing and had a great time with my significant other,1
Great hotel - enjoyed the pool. Staff was helpful.,1
The gentle that checked me in was very pleasant| professional and provided excellent customer service. The room is very nice and clean.,1
Was there to visit a niece at George Mason University. Staff was more than friendly and rooms were spacious and clean. Will definitely stay there again on my next trip to Fairfax.,1
It was my second stay at this hotel| staffs at front dsek was kind and very mu h trained well| it tool less than 2minutes to  check in| breakfast was good |only tiny  bit what i didn't like was a staff at breakfast place |overall it was  ery good stay.,1
Perfect quick stop in our way south. Very clean & comfortable.,1
The staff was so accommodating. I really appreciated it and I enjoyed my short stay.,1
"Had to call housekeeping 3 different times because they had forgotten to give us shampoo and conditioner| body wash and the maid didn't replace our dirty drinking glasses.Also discovered that if you charge meals to your room they automatically add an 18% tip. This was not disclosed anywhere that I could see. I was told that ""this is expected in the VA| MD and DC area"". I will be calling corporate to complain!",0
Very nice hotel| close to everything. Will stay again.,1
"There was a leak at the hotel so our room with two double beds was not avaiable. I was traveling with my 16 year old son for my father-in-laws funeral the next day| tired from traveling and a litlle cranky. Before I could even get upset|  the two representatives (I wish I could remember their names) had us laughing| joking around with me and my son| that was not thrilled that there was just a king size bed. Saw one of them the next morning| she remembered us and ask how it went in the ""man cave"" he had created on the couch side of the room...made us smile on a very sad day.",1
Everything was fantastic,1
We had a wonderful stay. Rosa in the restaurant always goes above & beyond for her customers every time we stay here.,1
Place was clean and nice but very minimal staff interaction compared to other Hyatts I have visited and front desk seemed less interested in me once they saw I had booked through Expedia.,1
Nice hotel within walking distance of a lot of cool shops,1
One of the worst Hotels I have been in. Could not sleep 2 nights due to neighbors either talking loud| thin walls| you can hear everything and other neighbors slamming doors constantly at 3:30am. It amazes me that people have no respect for others trying to sleep at 3-4am. The front entrance is horrible| lobby area is a joke. Anyone can basically walk into the hallways| no security. I will never EVER stay here and I will never ever stay at a Hyatt Hotel ever again. They just don't seem to know how to build buildings| and treat customers. Other Hyatt properties I stayed at had thin walls. This place is a total joke. I could not wait to get out of it. Never ever again.,0
Always a nice stay. Enjoy the staff front desk and cleaning staff.  See you soon,1
Very nice hotel and very clean,1
Very nice room ! Great service !,1
The room was dirty and there wasn't enough towels. Very disappointed,0
Check in was super fast. Hotel was beautifully decorated room was nice.,1
We took a family vacation to D.C.  This motel had a free community shuttle that took us to the metro station.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  (I had to get a form scanned and emailed back home and the motel staff was very helpful-no charge).  The rooms was spacious and clean.  I would highly recommend.,1
very neat hotel,1
Clean Spacious rooms Good location next to the mall,1
Gym was small. Bathroom had hair stuck to ceiling in shower. Check in person was not helpful or pleasant. Location was nice| close to restaraunts.,0
We had a great stay| room was awesome and all the staff was wonderful! Will make this our go to place for concert stays in VA.,1
It was great but when I checked in room wasn't ready at 6:00 pm,1
Overall this hotel is great! Clean rooms and facilities throughout| separate seating area to enjoy in your room and wonderful extras. The only problems we found with our room were 1. The bathroom door lock did not work at all & 2. One of the bed lights also did not work. Service was great from housekeepers to room service| everyone was extremely friendly. The only issue we had was when my fianc√© was brought the wrong omelette for breakfast but a simple phone call and it was quickly fixed. We liked the hotel so much we already booked it again to come back and stay in a few months!,1
Always a pleasure to stay at a Hyatt Regency. Beautiful| modern rooms.,1
I made a same day reservation and was able to check in early. The reception was absolutely wonderful. They were very professional| personable and prompt After 10 minutes in my room they called to ensure that the room was to my satisfaction. Also enjoyed the breakfast. The layout of the buffet hostesses|atomsphre|cleanliness|and food were all exceptional.,1
Aesthetic appealing design both internal and external Excellent breakfast Excellent neighborhood Proximity to my local event,1
staying close to airport since we had a 6:00 AM flight.  Worked out fine.  Hotel was close to a lot of restaurants,1
Spacious rooms| clean| and well-designed.  Great for those in wheelchairs| too.,1
Great stay. We have been coming to this Hyatt for years. Love the King Suite. The bedding is definitely a plus. Enjoy the area.,1
Nice hotel. I would come back here. Very comfortable room. ...........,1
Nice room great location close to shopping and expressways.,1
Very nice hotel. Spacious room| friendly staff| and good breakfast.,1
Very clean| quite nice| super staff| loved it there. The kids loved the pool| the room was perfect for our family. Breakfast was perfect everyday. Highly recommend,1
We always have a great time at this hotel!  Rooms are very nice!  The hotel is very convenient to restaurants and shopping in the area.,1
OK hotel.  Chose for location.  Slow internet.  Stayed one night visiting University.,1
Should not have to pay for paper ‚Äúto go‚Äù cups to take coffee up to the room especially when breakfast is included.,1
Nice separate living/desk area.  Also walkability to restaurants and shops.,1
No bottles of water; trash on the couch; there was a huge fly in the room!!!! Air conditioner has Big noise,0
My normal go-to hotel wasn't available| so I chose this hotel and am never going back!  From the cleanliness of the hotel to the service from the staff| it was nothing short of spectacular!  I will be back!,1
The room was clean and ready quickly,1
Good location and quiet,1
"Nice five star hotel;  big rooms; day ligh used nicely  - well maintained. Hotel location is good; facilies are goodJust we did not like ""cleaning on demand"" for house-keeping ( I guess due to covid issues) We are glad for the saty overall. Good price / performance.",1
Staff was great.,1
The room the inner structure very classy.,1
We loved the hotel and the service. Great front desk staff. They were able to help us with directions and additional information.,1
Hotel was very nice| staff was wonderful. Expensive to park 55 a day. Very clean| good shampoo| conditioner and gel (Beekman Brothers).Only neg is bed had heavy covers. So you cycled between being too hot with blankets on and too cold with them off.,1
Very nice staff and very pretty place to stay. Restaurants are very good as well!,1
the room was very clean and they beds were very comfortable,1
It was wonderful stay Hilton Capital Hill. Also they are very friendly and good service. Thank you,1
The restaurant/bar downstairs.,1
Very comfy and clean room! Check in was easy. Valet was exceptional and quick!,1
Friendly staff and quiet room| dog was happy.,1
The Hotel was very comfortable with a very professional attentive staff.,1
Will be back soon,1
It is close to the Capital and it easy and safe to walk around,1
Very clean and modern. Surprised about the neighborhood but still safe and in the city,1
We had a great view of the Capitol and the Metro was just a few blocks away. Super convenient.,1
Room was a good size and staff was friendly. My only criticism is there was no desk to sit at with a computer and outlet.,1
Overall the hotel and view were amazing| only complaint was even with the a/c on| the room stayed fairly warm. We set it to 60 to cool it off and it never got below 70. Otherwise our stay was wonderful.,1
Not enough tea in room,1
Good location| nice and gentle attention.  I will back to this hotel.,1
Can't beat the convenience of the property or top the friendliness of the staff. We'll gladly stay here again on a future visit! It was quiet| comfortable| and an easy walk to DC.,1
Everything was amazing from customer service to location to the awesome bed!!!!,1
Overall hotel experience was good. Valet was frustrating| the front was full of cars so we pulled into an empty space. Then we were asked to move the car into another empty space. The point of valet is they move the car for you. We also got charged by the valet app as well as the hotel so we got charged twice. However| the hotel was able to correct it relatively quick. The room was relatively clean and hotel was nice.,1
Perfect stay in every way! Pandemic preparations for guests was exceptional!,1
Very clean comfortable stay. Was there for my NCLEX exam which was literally the next building over so location was very convenient. Staff was very friendly and helpful,1
No bar or restaurant. When I looked at this propertyonline| there was no mention of them being closed. I also was quoted a much different price than I was billed for.  Next time its Hyatt for me and my friends.,0
its was crazy when i checked in the name of the hotel was changing the next day so i felt lost until in and asked and they clarified everything about the changes|i love the room i will be booking again it was worth the price.,1
Limited food service. and I was limited in my ability to socialize.,1
Everything was clean |excelent service|the room was confortable,1
I liked the hotel and we come back again but next time hope that there will not be a Trump rally going on that's the only thing that I did not like because they were protesting in front on the hotel that's not good for your business .,1
The stay was wonderful.  The front desk staff was helpful in every way,1
Absolutely perfect| the person at the reception desk Alain was very courteous and everyone was very nice! I recommend this hotel close to everything!,1
When we walked in| my kid looked around and said ‚ÄúMom| we must be rich to afford this  hotel!‚Äù Then the room was so spacious & the shower was amazing & I literally thought maybe I had made some mistake on the booking & checked my invoice. I wish this hotel was in every city!,1
Nice hotel but in a bad district.. definitely want to Uber or drive to do anything.. walking from this location is dangerous,1
Staff very friendl| helpful and made our stay special.  Rooms were clean and comfortable.   Loved it,1
couldnt get in our room they changed rooms and could,0
The stay was great. Very clean and comfortable rooms and the staff were very welcoming. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed and will stay again real soon!,1
Absolutely wonderful customer service.  I would definitely stay here again- excellent all around!,1
I liked so much the hotel| very good service.Good service| desk service exceptional .,1
We really enjoyed our time in the Washington Court Hotel. The employees (desk| valet| doorman) were all very nice and helpful. The room was clean and well stocked with towels| shampoo| etc. Size of the room was comparable to other hotels in the area. We did not use the restaurants| so no comment on those. This hotel is very close to a working fire department| so we did hear sirens quite often. Also| this hotel is about 1 mile from Smithsonians| National Mall| etc. It was a nice walk for us each day| but wanted to point that out for others. It is close to a couple of delis/breakfast locations| but we didn't see very many restaurants for dinner in the area.,1
Wonderful hotel and very convenient location to the Capital and the museums on the mall  Easy walk to Union Station and metro.  Our room had a great view of the Capital dome.,1
Hotel and restaurant appearance was great. Prices were too high.,1
The staff was great and the cost was good good and I will return soon.,1
This hotel is just a 5 minute walk from Union Station and I enjoyed my stay very much. The hotel personnel were all very professional| friendly| and helpful. Check-in was quick and my room was spotlessly clean. The bathroom was large and very user-friendly. The bed was perfect for sleeping away any worries. I ate breakfast at the hotel| and it was delicious. I will stay here again.,1
I liked the lobby| nice design. Check in person at desk could have been friendlier.,1
Facilities charges of US$23 plus a day should be charged upfront when online booking is made. When the hotel charge this at point of check in| It inflated the charges and leaves a rude shock. Yes Expedia does warn about this but I can't see why this can't be included as part of the offer price online.,1
Everything is good| nice building| love this hotel,1
Staff are very very friendly| especially those at the front desk. Clean hotel. Nice breakfast,1
I had to cancel my stay the morning of due to my job interview date being moved and they refused to refund me. Now I have to file an insurance claim. Not ideal!,0
It is close to the Capitol and the museums| good food and drinks,1
They tried to charge me for breakfast and it was included,1
This property had amazing rooms| very spacious and conveniently located.,1
Lovely & Comfy place to stay...everything is near !,1
It was a nice location. The bathroom was kinda dirty| there was hair on the shower wall and dirt/dust in the corner of the floors. Didn't looked washed very well,1
Convenient location| friendly service and cleanliness.,1
Five star hotel at a three star price. Nice and quiet. Close to everything. The only downfall is sitting down to breakfast and getting a bill when we were told it was included. It was included and we didn't have to pay it but they should warn you first.,1
Nice hotel| nice staff and great customer service,1
Amazing customer service from top to bottom.,1
Our stay was great from the service to the hotel cleanliness! Our room had a view of Capitol Hill. The only issue we had was that the toilet was clogged for most of our stay so the whole family had to go to the public restroom in the lobby to brush our teeth etc..,1
The location was great. All major sites are within walking distance of a mile or so. Uber and Lyft| with scooters and bikes are abundant in the area. Nice places to grab a bite to eat| coffee| even Walmart is less than a mile away. Plenty of other people walking and having fun| so safety was not an issue even for a single female.Staff was very nice and helpful| door keeper was always smiling and ready to help. Breakfast staff was great and the breakfast was wonderful. Eggs bacon bagels cereal fruit| hot tea|  coffee were available daily until 11am. Be sure to get this included with your stay or it will be $20 extra.Exercise room was also nice with several treadmills| 2 bikes| free weights and machines for leg curls extensions and abdominal work out. Definately more than I have seen at other hotels.We did not park a car so I am not sure about that but you really don't need it. The ONLY negative about this hotel was the cleaning. There was more hair in our bathroom after they cleaned than before. Not sure how they managed this one but after seeing this| we declined the housekeeping until we checked out.If they correct this I would give it 5 stars easy! Very good hotel for the price.,1
Great location| friendly staff| clean rooms and good atmosphere.,1
Too much hidden fee|1. Parking was NOT include in this price. 57$ extra.2. There are no chances to get a dinner on Sunday|3. In the room just 2 bottles of water and 2 coffee for 3 guests|4. 26$ extra charge for facility needs.WOWüò®For What did I pay before?!5. Breakfast is NOT include! Good morning,0
Front desk staff was rude and unprofessional. Experienced racial discrimination & profiling at this hotel| by front desk assistant manager MAYROSE. There was some miscommunication with regards to  daily 'facility fee' which was less than $30 a day| I was not informed at check in| I was only informed about a deposit for incidentals. Paid for my entire stay prior to check in by the way. The situation was handled poorly| even up to senior management. Left a bad taste in my mouth about the property. I also just realized I over paid for the ‚Äòfacility fee'. I also had issues with the room key not working| and needing to be reset anytime I stepped out of the hotel. Besides the unfortunate incident| the hotel was great. Great location| clean| comfortable..,0
Staff was very cordial and accommodating. I accidentally booked the wrong night and they helped fix it at a similar rate. Very clean and nice rooms. Comfortable beds. Directly across from Georgetown Law.,1
Clean facility and clearly new updated. Several cracks and breaks in the rooms. Poor scent insulation. Overpowering scent of marijuana plagued the elevators and some of the hallways. Coordinated and well planned room. Lastly| noise blocking the rooms would be nice. Shouldn't have to hear everything going on outside.,1
The staff was extremely accommodating and let us even check in early after a late cancelation on one night. Amazing room and atmosphere for the price! Will be the only hotel I use in DC from now on! Beyond satisfied!,1
Great staff and clean room. Very walkable area near a lot,1
Very clean. However| our room did not have the view of the Capitol as advertised on the Expedia page.,1
Great location and wonderful staff. Very upscale and nice. Parking is $54 a night| kinda steep.,1
Hotel is in a good location. Alot of sketchy traffic in and out. Front desk lost my package with some important documents and found it later that evening after my meeting was over.,1
These people are crooks. They charged a facility fee of $27.00 even though everything was supposed to be covered by Hotels.com  I W ILL NEVER STAY WITH THESE CRIMINALS AGAIN. If there are hidden charges I will probably not use hotels.com again,0
This was a great location to union station| and a nice walk to the National Mall. I would definitely stay here again.,1
Great Location| Clean| Easy access to Union Station.  Staff was professional| courteous| and cooperative in meeting my needs.  Would definitely stay here again if the opportunity arises.,1
Excelente location. Clean and confortable. We really enjoyed our stay.,1
The room and staff were very nice. I chose this hotel because of the closeness to the Nationals Parade. It turned out to be close to many fun things to do as well! Great stay.,1
We loved the bar in the hotel. A little pricey but the convenience of it being there was worth a little extra. There were plenty of places to eat within walking distance. It was only a half mile walk to the capitol. The staff was very helpful. We didn't have to ask for a thing.,1
The location was great.  The staff was friendly and personable remembering my name when the bellman opened the door,1
The staff was nice| the property was clean and felt very modern. Big TVs| cool tablets as alarm clocks. Great location near Union Station and within walking distance of the mall. Great place.,1
Location was great and bathroom space was amazing for the both of us,1
Very well located. Near Capitol and close to subway which makes transportation easier (near Union Station). Bar/Restaurants are close to the hotel too.,1
Was charged hidden fees| the receptionists were not all that understanding. They have you pay for parking on top of the price per night| they charged us for food that we didn't even eat. Breakfast is not included. There was a hole in the ceiling of our room when we got there. If you can avoid this hotel| do so.,0
Everyone was exceptionally welcoming and helpful.  The hotel was a pleasure to stay at while we toured some of tge highlights of Washington DC!  Would definitely recommend it ti a fruend ir family member! üëçüòÉüëè,1
But  the fact they don't have a pool| everything else is good.,1
It is located near capitol hill. It is really good.,1
The best part of the stay was a man by the name of Clifton. It's difficult to find people that truly understand customer service. Clifton mastered this and made our stay enjoyable| as we were first time DC travelers. We will come back and send many friends. This hotel will be our only option in DC.,1
There was always a line at check-in and staff running around| so I assume that the hotel is understaffed.,1
My fianc√© and I loved our stay at this hotel. From the moment we checked in up to check out| had no complaints. Also being a Pet Friendly hotel was totally a plus. Would definitely stay here again if we are ever in town again.,1
Very close to tourist activities. Staff were kind and helpful.,1
I enjoyed my stay at the Washington Court Hotel.  We were there to move my son back into college.  The location of the hotel was convenient and allowed for a great walk to explore the grounds of the Capitol building.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  I did have a problem using the link to call for my car on the day I was leaving| so had to wait a bit longer than I would have liked.  Overall| I would stay here again.,1
Street noise. Seemed Short-staffed but okay overall.,1
Very happy with our room. Clean| updated and felt very comfortable staying there.,1
So happy to stay here. It's closed to the Union Station| Capitol| National Mall|... there is also a Capital BikeShare right next to it on the right of building that really help for getting around and back to hotel. I definitely recommend it because of the reasonable price| great service and beautiful room| so I'll be back again.,1
It was in a very convenient location| because we used the capital bike share just in front of the hotel.,1
I liked the iPad that was available in the room! Made checking out the area very convenient.,1
"My co-worker and I stayed at the Washington Court Hotel because the seminar that we attended for three days was held in their ""ballroom"". Upon arrival| the attendant at the front desk was rude. After checking in and going in to the hotel room| I found hair on the counter of the bathroom and in the shower in the room that I was staying in. When I walked in to my co-workers room| I could immediately see stains all over the outer edge of the fitted sheet and her room smelled musty. After we returned home| we found that the credit cards that we gave to them for $50 ""incidentals"" (if we trashed the room - which we did not) were charged an additional $79.14 each for ""facility fees/taxes"". We were not told that our cards were going to be charged these facility fees and did not give our permission to charge them for this. Our original company card that we booked the room with should have been charged these fees. When we called to ask what these fees included we were met with a very rude employee| again| who did not resolve our situation. My co-worker and I have stayed at several Washington DC area hotels and have never experienced these things and we are very disappointing in this  hotel and will NEVER stay there again and will be sure to let our office know not to stay at the Washington Court Hotel on any of there trips to DC.The rooms are duty| the staff (except for the door men) are rude.",0
"Everything else was good| but they have a hidden fee which upset me very much. They charge ""facilities fee"" of $26.38 daily. They never notified me about this fee until I was checking out. Hotel management said I had to pay because it is ""mandatory"" fee. It should have been already included in the booking fare or at least notified guests at the time of reservation or when checking-in. The hotel should change their practice of charging hidden fee so that it looks like a cheaper hotel.",0
Everything was good. Front desk was very pleasant. Room was clean and had a great view.,1
Don't understand the $22 facilities fee. We did not use any facilities other than our room and the elevator to get to it. So why were we charged an extra $22+ for something we did not use?,1
facility is very clean and the location is convenient.,1
Parking is a bit expensive but the service was good.,1
Resort fee? For what ? No pool no services Parking exorbitant | no room service| breakfast expensive,0
With vip access we didn't get any benefits. That was disappointing,1
Happy with the location ans service. Overall nice experience.,1
Cleanliness| professional and friendly staff. Near U S Capitol and Union Station Mall,1
Lovely comfortable hotel. Very clean. Great size room. Nice staff and good location,1
Location and staff was very attentive . I was glad to enjoy the property,1
Charged me xtra for parking and fees after check out on my card...stay was good otherwise!,1
Location is very close to main sight seeing. Walking distance to metro station.,1
Everything  was well organized . Staff services was good parking ok,1
Great location| we could see the capitol building from our window & we walked to everything. Beautiful room| comfortable bed.,1
Great hotel.   I was pleasantly surprised by the great furnishings| large room| and overall bright/clean hotel.  Location is good for events at Capital One Arena. close to dining and shopping.  Was well worth the price.,1
Staff was friendly and helpful.  Hotel was conveniently located.,1
The price and the location are GREAT. The hotel overall is pretty and the staff is friendly| specially the doorman. The cleanliness is TERRIBLE. Our first room had peanuts all over the floor| and the air conditioner duct was throwing out black dust. We asked to be changed and they were very sorry and gave us another room. That other room also had the air conditioner filter NASTY and the ducts| including the one in the shower. Plus the room was really warm at 60F| I guess is because they need to clean the A/C.  I did a coffee in the Keurig machine and it came out with small hairs.,0
The hotel is wonderful special for the location to kind of tour with my family we had a  good time and be able to see some of the many monuments an government places around the Capitol and Union Station.,1
Great Interiors. Very Comfortable ambience. And especially the service was the best.,1
The CJD Foundation has their annual conference at WCH. We return every year because of the location on Capitol Hill| the excellent staff and delicious food in their outlets. The only wish is that the hotel had a pool.,1
Modern hotel| convenient for Union station and Capitol building.  Room service did not get delivered but management apologised and took money off our bill.,1
The reception staff were great| approachable and informative. The room service was a bit hit and miss| some days they didn't replenish  the teas| coffee or water but the reception staff were ready and willing to assist. 5 stars to the receptionists and door staff.,1
Good service and nice room.  I will definitely recommend it to  my friends.,1
The hotel was great| awesome bar and restaurants. Plus I saw a celebrity which was very cool!,1
Very nice staff. Hotel clean and near tourist attractions.,1
Spaceous ansd location.Staff prifessionalism and response.Cleanliness.,1
I attended the womenGROW Leadership Summit| and the experience was excellent even before I checked-in. I called to ensure that I could store my luggage prior to check-in| and Cliff treated me as if he knew me personally. He was so warm and welcoming and pleasure to work with from check-in to check-out. Cliff clearly loves the WCH| and it shows in his work. All of the staff was GREAT! The room was clean| spacious| and comfortable. The lobby bar was nice. The only con is the conference rooms were extremely cold. The continental breakfast was excellent and the refreshments and amenities placed around the conference areas were such a nice touch. I'll definitely consider the Washington Court Hotel FIRST on my next trip to DC.,1
Service was great. Enjoyed the stay but wish there were activities available like pool or entertainment,1
We had a wonderful stay. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming. We would definitely recommend staying here!,1
The staff was excellent!  Friendly| professional and extremely helpful.  Loved the restaurant breakfast!,1
We really appreciated the spaciousness of the bathroom. We liked the walk-in shower and the absence of a tub. Having a built in bench in the shower is a nice touch for those who might need to use it. We also liked the long shelf in the bathroom that could be used for whatever you want such as toiletry items| clothing| etc.Bed was very comfortable. The room was a bit larger than standard hotel rooms. The location of the hotel to all the national monuments cannot be beat. An easy walk to the Capitol started the beginning of our walking tour.√ÆThe only thing we don't care for is the mandatory resort fee. We don't think there is any extra perk that's worth this fee. Just add it to the base price. The parking fee of $48 seems steep| but we do not know how it compares to other hotels in the area.,1
The staff was exceptional! Very friendly| professional and helpful.,1
Staff was very accommodating. Room was quiet and clean.,1
Berry close to the center of the city Within walking distance to the Capital,1
Comfy bed| spacious room. The hotel itself is beautiful| inside and out| and so incredibly close to the Capitol!,1
upon our return to DC| room 1403 will be home station. Great location| wonderful service,1
The room and view was very beautiful. Only complaint is the $22 fee added onto the price,1
The service and breakfast were excellent.  The room was modern and clean.  Loved the shower.,1
Great location and a lovely property -- and pet-friendly at no additional cost| which is both welcome and unusual for a high-end hotel (a life-saver for my recent trip to DC).  The only drawback is that it's not inexpensive.,1
Staff was awesome and had great customer service. Hotel was beautiful.,1
very nice rooms and everyone was so friendly and helpful with lots of advise.  We had a great view and it was close to a lot of sites,1
Perfectly located within walking distance of Union Station| restaurants and attractions,1
My 10 year old nephew was trapped behind the shower door & when his father attempted to open the door the glass shattered. The child & the father were covered in glass. I am disappointed in the hotels handling of this situation. The incident happened at 3:15 they were in DC for my sons 5:00 wedding. The hotel never followed up with them. Apparently they were unconcerned that both the child & the father could have been seriously injured. We were very disappointed in the service they received.,0
excelent ubication nice bath nice beds and beautiful people,1
Several of the front desk staff didn't seem to be able to answer general questions that I would have expected them to know (mostly about the area of town we were in). But they were nice and accommodating. We didn't have any major problems:,1
Fantastic hotel. Friendly staff| Good breakfast and location is great too,1
The room is dark| bathroom cealing chipped and cracked pretty badly.  They ignored your requests totally.  It doesn't worth the price at all.,0
Convenient to public transportation and museums they updated our room because we had to wait to check in,1
The place was nice and clean.  The staff was friendly. My biggest issue was that they charge you $54 a night to park which is ridiculous and no complimentary shuttles. If I had known that I would have never stayed there.,1
The property is beautiful! The staff was also very friendly and accommodating. The room was luxurious and well laid out. I would gladly stay here again!,1
This hotel is in a really convenient location for the major attractions in Washington| 10 minute walking distance of good places to eat and only a short walk to Union Station,1
Good location| staff is very nice | not the cleanest but for the price point everything was fine,1
Very warm staff who kindly retrieved my chargers after I left them in the room at check out. Would highly recommend for business or personal travel.,1
Accommodations were very nice and clean.  Locations was convenient to the Metro and the mall.  Only valet parking was available at the hotel| and the parking fees were quite pricey.,1
Great location| friendly staff| and wonderful accommodations. A little disappointed in overnight parking - I was certain the website said $30| but upon arrival it was $54. Other than that| the hotel met expectations.,1
Awesome property. It's convenient to the mall. The only downside is the gym is quite small,1
Capital bikeshare located on property| great views and service,1
Close to everything. Very nice room. Staff| that I interacted with| is great. Did not get a room refresh after the first night.,1
The entrance to the hotel was odd..................,1
Great property| comfy beds| and stylish for business meetings. Great location| not too many restaurants close by but a few within walking distance.,1
Hotel room is clean| beds are comfortable| with complimentary bottled water and Keurig coffee maker is provided. The best part i like is the bathroom because it is big| clean and it has a separate shower. The water from the shower head is generous and strong. I also like the hotel lobby with high ceiling| chic interiors| there is a bar and a restaurant in tje lobby as well. Hotel concierge is welcoming and friendly. Great experience all in all.,1
Excellent location Nice lobby bar with food options,1
Very clean and comfortable hotel in a very good location,1
Everything was great except on Saturday night that we had dinner in the restaurant we saw a mouse which was quite uncomfortable,1
Parking situations wasn't superb. Recommend parking down the street. Other than that| great place.,1
Nice hotel| nice location. I wish parking was a bit cheaper.,1
Great location if you have meeting in the area. The lobby bar could be better service wise and just lacking a little ambiance.,1
Great place would recommend to anyone who's looking for a top notch hotel in DC.,1
Very nice| comfortable rooms.  Great location.  Friendly| helpful staff,1
It was great . This was my third time staying here,1
I was pleasantly surprised with how comfortable and clean the hotel was. Best nights sleep I've had at a hotel in quite a while. Very friendly staff and convenient location. This may be my new favorite DC hotel as long as the price stays competitive.,1
Great location| rooms are comfortable and well appointed| staff is friendly| great spacious lobby and hotel bar,1
Very nice| well worth the money and great location.,1
The hotel was great| but the cost of the Coffee in the restaurant was $4.  I think that is excessive.,1
Second visit to D.C. staying at the hotel.  Like the location.  Friendly staff.  Clean room.  Nice restaurant.  Look forward to staying again.,1
I'll def be back.,1
Loved everything about my stay. Everything was clean and modern. Service was good too.,1
Highly recommended| clean & very modern. Walking distance to the Capital.,1
I had a room with a great view!  There was no room service| but that was ok.,1
The lobby was pretty| over hotel and room very clean,1
Nice hotel| friendly and helpful staff. convenient to the capitol and other places of interest.,1
The parking lot fee is very expensive.,1
Liked all except their internet needs to be fixed. They acknolowledged they are having problems and planned to updatev,1
Nice Hitel close to Smithsonian Museums and  distance from Union horlel was hardly 6 min which was very heelpful.,1
Michael in the lounge/restaurant always remembered what my daughter and I wanted and made sure we was taking care of. Friendly front desk staff Ever!!! Will stay at this hotel again for sure,1
The location was great and the staff was wonderful.,1
such a great place to stay! was very satisfied with the room & services of the hotel. definitely will stay again when i come back to DC.,1
Do not plan on parking or dealing with the front desk staff. The TV stopped working when it was raining...,0
Very classy hotel and ambiance.  I will stay again,1
I really love the rooms to include the use of technology. WC will be my first choice always.,1
Very nice hotel| clean| great staff| in prime location. Would definitely recommend. I traveled with a dog and no extra fees. Tom was spacious and bed really comfortable.,1
The room is exceptionally clean; the toiletries are expensive| and the pillows are quality standard -soft and white,1
The lobby is incredible.The room doesn't have a microwave.The valet parking was very expensive.,1
Great location| great service| great price  - I would definitely go back,1
Very clean. Staff friendly. Nice view and comfortable bed,1
Hotel was very nice. Staff was welcoming especially on Christmas Day.,1
Terrible. Beware. From the beginning the services were a joke. $54 to park per car per night. The tv didn't work| the hot water didn't work (yes| seriously)| small amenities were left in the room empty (shower cap box with no cap)| just all around a really poor service experience. When I spoke to a supervisor he appeared to be sympathetic and even laughed when I went over our experience with him (I thought it was laughing WITH me at the time) and offered to come one of the 2 rooms I booked AND offered a food credit for the $20 breakfast Buffett (skip it| 100% not worth it). He gave us $100 towards this| after I mentioned we were a party of 7. I confirmed this again in the AM before breakfast and we were asked to initiate the comp through hotels.com and when I called the general manager| Sam| immediately told me how mistaken I was and that he never authorized this and that I was offered one or the other and not both. He wasn't the supervisor I dealt with and had ZERO interest in making an awful experience better or in managing an escalated customer complaint. He defaulted to the notes and called me a liar in all senses but pretended to be hurt when I called him on this because he didn't actually say the word ‚Äúliar‚Äù. Seriously| be warned.,0
Location was great| staff friendly and efficient well designed,1
Friendly staff| spacious room| pretty lobby| convenient valet parking onsite but very pricy.,1
The Washington Court was very nice. The ambiance and decor was perfect for the holidays. It was a quick ride to Pennsylvania Ave to see all the major sites. From the receptionist Samson to the bartender Gerry| great service! Therewas no official room servce| i had to go down to the bar to order food and wait for it to take back up to room but the atmosphere was nice with all the Christmas decor that i did not mind. Overall great experience. I will return on my next trip to DC.,1
Great Hotel. Evening food options were not the best.,1
This is my second time staying at this hotel. The first was almost 6 years ago.  They have done some major renovations and upgrading of the rooms since then | and the rooms were pretty nice to begin with.  Friendly staff| quick check in & check out.,1
"This is a great hotel around the corner from Union Station. The only issue I had was that the blurb on hotels.com said ""free wifi"". This is not the case. There is a $22.93 ""resort fee"" added to the price that covers ""water in the room| and Internet"". This is specified in small print in the pricing| but is obviously done to make the initial price look lower.",1
While in my room my husband and I were laying in the bed and the whole headboard just fell off the wall onto us completely shocked us. it was very disturbing as to why the headboard would just come off of the wall and fall on to us while we were laying in the bed. I had to go downstairs to let someone know because the phone in the room had been pulled out of the wall by this experience .  Shook me up completely .,1
All of the employees were extremely nice and accommodating!!! I would definitely stay again!!!!,1
Staff was helpful and informative. Above and beyond what was expected. Hotel was priced reasonably. The Valet could take a few lessons on pricing. A facility fee for each day car was in the garage is silly. Our car went in on Friday and never moved til Sunday and we still had to pay a facility fee .. $20 a day when the car never moved. Taxes I understand| but really. My only bark Beautiful place,1
We stayed in DC only for 1 night to attend a concert. I chose the Washington Court Hotel because of its proximity to the venue| the affordable price| and the pets-stay-free policy. We had a very easy check in| great service from the friendly staff| and a fun time! Walking proximity to a few restaurants is a plus!,1
My whole stay was very good!  The staff at valet and the front desk were prompt| pleasant| eager to help and very attentive. Thank you!!!,1
Nice room| comfortable bed,1
very nice place and clean| good price| staff so good,1
Clean and big. I love the fact that it is so close to the station,1
The one that they need improvement is wirh the valet parking.  We were the only people outside waiting for our car and it took 10 minutes for the valet person to show up and then it took them another 15 minutes to bring the car.   On the first try they brought out the wrong car.   Needs much improvement,1
Very beautiful I loved it,1
Location was very convenient. Close to many things,1
We enjoyed our stay and had good help from staff. Taes and fees are extra.,1
Very clean room. Staff was friendly. A lot of the amenities were not available at the time we were there and requesting our car and luggage assistance was very difficult at check out.,1
Close to the Capital and airport. Check in staff were friendly and helpful.,1
The hotel room was very clean and offered us a great view of the city. It was conveniently located across the street from a convenience store and Starbucks. Pricing of the food in the hotel was on par with food fare in the surrounding area ($14 for a breakfast sandwich). The hotel is within a short walking distance of the Capitol and the various museums. We couldn't have asked for more! The doormen were probably my favorite of all the hotel staff. Kind| professional| and knowledgeable of the area. We will visit this hotel again.,1
The location was great to get to all the Museums and Union Station everything was within walking distance.  The staff seemed pre occupied with talking to each other and not interacting with guests or doing their job.,1
the overnight parking there was $54| $20 for the Breakfast and they put in a room where the tub and sink was stopped up....,1
The hotel was convenient for everything I wanted to do. The staff was friendly and helpful. The decor was very nice. Overall a great stay,1
Our stay at Washington Court Hotel was amazing - more than we expected and especially for the price! Plan on staying again!!!,1
Great location| helpful and friendly staff| clean and comfortable rooms. Not anything fancy but great value for the price! Loved the bathroom and the big tv.,1
Liked the modern decor.  Room was very comfortable.,1
Great staff.  Little expensive on the breakfast but the next day was buy one get one free.,1
Nice interior design and beautiful room design for nice price range. Impressive stay| including few complimentary deals!,1
If you read the reviews beforehand they do advise you in the reviews of the fees|who can figure out what the fees were for||there wasn't even coffee available to you in the morning in the lobby|it is a good place to stay tho|| I found it to be quiet at least when we were there| the staff were better the second day| obviously not everybody's always in a great mood all the time I get that. hate to say it we ended up going across the street to the Hyatt to use their concier and sit and wait for our night Tour |that was one of the places that they pick up.it was in a good place I just think they should at least offer coffee or something especially if you're going to have some kind of funky fees..,1
Very nice hotel| friendly staff| extremely comfortable bed but the room was slightly small. It wasn't a big deal since I was only there one night. The hotel is very conveniently located. I would definitely stay here again.,1
Based upon the price and some previous negative reviews| I wasn't quite sure what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised with my stay at the WCH. It was an easy walk from Union Station| check-in was quick and pleasant| and the room was large| clean| and bright.  It was a quick trip and I didn't try the restaurant or bar but would stay there again for a quick business trip.,1
Did not like getting charged for WiFi. Otherwise a very nice hotel. Great staff.,1
2 things left a very sour feeling about our stay. 1st Expedia stated that there would be a $22 fee when we got to the hotel. Fine. We were charged a second $22 fee with the $50 valet overnight parking fee.   That is ridiculous. 2nd we left a pair of shoes in the room| they said they didn't find them| we called less than an hour after we left| they were there.,0
Price was excellent for a great location. Smallish for major city. Everything clean & orderly. My group unexpectedly hit the bar with 100+ people. They managed it really well. I think the hotel manager was even serving drinks to tables. Restaurant is breakfast only‚Äîtable service or buffet. We ordered off the menu; it was basic but tasted fine. I've slready recommended this lace to friends who travel to DC.,1
Very nice hotel.  We were on the 16th floor and the ceiling needs to be fixed as I believe they had a leak.  Note that we went through Hotels.com and were surprised to have a 19.95 + Tax facility fee charge for each day.  I don't know what facilities they had to offer as we used nothing.  They could update the TV selection for more sports channels.  Front desk very friendly and helpful.,1
We had a room with a view overlooking the capitol building and the room was spacious and clean. The bartender Tony was friendly and gave suggestions on what to see and where to go eat. Several of the locals come here after work and Tony knows them by name which says a lot of a good bartender.,1
Front desk staff was great. Had trouble connecting to Wi-Fi. Bathrooms need ventilation fans.,1
Very nice hotel| just a short walk from the National Mall| Capitol building and White House. Room was huge| clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay here again.,1
Able to walk to Capitol Center.   Great accommodations and staff.,1
Excellent location. Close to food and the tourist areas. Staff was very helpful and the room was very big with a comfy bed.,1
Clean hotel that was very close to all museums and restaurants   Also walking distance to Capitol.   Would recommend it.  Only wish double beds were queen!!!!,1
good central location for where i needed to be.Friendly and courteous staff.,1
It was close to the National Mall and Union Station,1
Great hotel but parking is $54/night and Wi-Fi is $10.99/day.  Who charges for Wi-Fi anymore?,1
Location is awesome if you're looking to explore Capitol Hill. The hotel is very posh and upscale. Staff was super nice and welcoming,1
Great place to stay in DC. Definitely will visit again.,1
Nice staff| clean modern hotel right by Union station| loved our stay there!! Would definitely book again.,1
very friendly staff!!  A little expensive stay though.,1
Very pleasant surprise.  A well appointed room| in a great location on Capitol Hill. We were in town for a Washington Capitols hockey game.  The hotel was an easy walk to the Verizon Center.  There is a restaurant and bar that appeared very nice in the hotel although we did not eat there  The rooms are clean and very well appointed. The hotel is also very near Union Station and the Dubliner Irish Pub which is a favorite of ours.  Would definitely stay again,1
This was a perfect choice for a one night stay in DC. Excellent value for the money.,1
Clifton at check-in was friendly and fun to talk to. Our door to the room was a bit tricky to get into but staff helped us in and we didn't have any problems after that. There were hairs left in the shower from the previous occupant so the shower was not thoroughly cleaned but the room was lovely and we enjoyed our stay very much.,1
Horrible checking in I'm a good member and I never had such a good experience,0
It was nice stay| the location fitted our purposes of the trip.,1
Staff are super friendly!!!the place is clean and so close to transportation and food.,1
Am recommending to my friends and family.,1
Hotel was gorgeous and valet parking was easy. Great location for national mall and union station.  Rooms were excellent and modern. Would recommended to others looking to stay in DC for work or vacation,1
Perfect for sight seeing around the capital.   Cabs and ubers are necessary for most dining options.,1
Great location- convenient! Wonderful staff too. Easy walk to Capital & Union Station.,1
This was a very nice hotel to stay in while visiting DC. We enjoyed our time here.,1
Beautiful hotel that is conveniently located. Staff were extremely kind and helpful. Allowed us to change and shower in the exercise facility when our flight shuttle wasn't until 3pm when check out was at noon. Highly recommend.,1
Good service| clean rooms & easy check in & out| staff was helpful,1
I enjoyed my stay but I didn't like that I had to give a $100 deposit prior to getting my key. Then I received a bill for fees that no one can really explain why I am charged. If I have to pay fees| I would prefer paying it upfront and elaborate what fee is for.,1
It was a neat and tidy hotel. Fairly close to all attractions.,1
love the hotel and its staff and location. breakfast was a little disappointing| but i believe that really isn't anything to keep anyone from going...an off morning| perhaps....i recommend this hotel!,1
Older hotel but very nice common areas!  Our room was very spacious and had a great view| and the bathroom was very nice!  We had to really push to open and close the door of our room| but that wasn't a big problem. The location was convenient and safe.  It was a 10-minute walk to Union Station| and there were some restaurants and coffee places close by.,1
Very nice! Comfy bed and pillows!,1
clean| comfortable| great location| very pleasant staff,1
We were able to get on public trans to visit DC. Also places easily and safety walked to. The area felt safe. Lots to look at. Out of the DC hubbub.  Nice!,1
The hotel is located in a very nice area that's close to the capitol hill where the touristic places are located. The staff were very friendly and helpful | the rooms were very clean and had everything described. Overall it is a very place | would definitely go back there again.,1
Location close to the train station was the reason for the booking. The bathroom was outstanding but the carpet in the room was dated and the mattresses were old and not at all comfortable. The staff was very courteous and the service was excellent.,1
Great Hotel.,1
Nice place| amazing staff| but they charge you $22 Resort Fee per night on top of your room for WiFi which is a laughable fee for something so standard. No Dinner service and the bar/restaurant shuts down WAY early. Not a ton of close dining options so that was a bummer. Otherwise its a great place.,1
Breakfast unaccettable for this level of hotel| and an issue on the second day the room was not ready at seven in the afternoon,0
The frontal desk is good. But the tablet| hair dryer were broken| you need to check them. The sound- proofing was not good| and I heard somebody sing and argue. So I couldn't sleep well.,0
Great placeQuiet area Needs more option of foodStaff great,1
Excellent location. Great breakfast. Close to Union Station and the Capitol.,1
Just Perfect,1
Customer service was great.,1
Staff was great. Restaurant not serving dinner or breakfast. We had a bad experience of racism chats from the family or people next door. It was bad. But you can blame hotel for inoragant people.,1
Clean,1
Loved staying there,1
The rooms and facility were great.. the service was almost non-existent,1
The building is old and it looks like minimal renovations were done to the rooms BUT the bar and snack area was a nice touch. The food was basic but wasn't horrible. 3.5 to be honest,1
This hotel was great| easy parking| nice amenities| close to Highway and shopping.,1
Clean room and nice staff. The only complaint was that the pool was only open on the weekends. It would have been nice to know that before I booked the room.,1
Expedia is awful to work with. Do not use them.,0
NIce hotel.  Two parking lots. Closest one gets filled.,1
our stay with you was good. We were helping someone move all day and just need a bed and a shower your business provided that.  thank you  Paula,1
Great hotel snd experience. Location| size and price were perfect. Would highly recommend and I'm hoping to return.,1
Very friendly staff| clean room. No complaints here!,1
Settled right in the perfect spot. We check in| and from the beginning| we were struck by awe. The atmosphere pulled straight from a movie.,1
Room was spacious and clean. Very convenient location.,1
It was a nice family trip with our toddler girls. Room was kid friendly. It was a little dusty so you can tell it hasn't been used in awhile since the last cleaning but it was clean. I do think they should update the desk chair cause it was cracked and peeling and the sofa was outdated. Everything was comfortable for us. Will definitely stay again,1
It's worth it to stay here just for the wood fired French Toast in the restaurant,1
Very clean and a very nice hotel!!,1
Thanks to covid they don't give you any service anymore| good luck getting a decent meal with some real silverware or breakfast for that matter.  Thanks to covid you would think they keep the rooms clean| no of course not. It is important to provide paper cups and no room service| but the room can make you sick just looking at how dirty it is. Asking to fix the problem also does not help. For some reason the housekeeper couldn't see what I saw.  I have stayed many times at this property and it is obvious that it is just getting worse and worse. Needless to say I will not be returning.,0
The stay was over-all great. The room smelled like straight acetone. It was really clean. An agent reached out via text and asked if I needed anything| which is amazing. The agent wasn't aware that I had certain perks| but was quick to fix it and accommodate where need be. Hotel was very clean and did great with social distancing.,1
Clean place I recommended,1
All personnel were friendly and informative. The hotel was clean and very comfortable,1
Both Ben and  Eudice at the front desk were outstanding and dealt with problems we had and made us feel spec| exceedingly well cared for and happy to be at their hotel,1
It was lovely. The staff was extremely accommodating. The smaller pillows were a little too soft. My sister and I needed an extra blanket and 4 pillows| which the staff quickly sent up. The shower was smaller than what was shown in the photos| and the hot water temperature was a little hard to keep consistent but all was well. The mini fridge was very convenient. We will definitely stay again if we have the opportunity. Also| the texts from the front desk made communication and service very convenient.,1
Customer and room service are bad,0
We loved this hotel. It is very clean and its location is very convenient for diner and shopping.,1
Bathroom was a little dirty| carpet had stains| ice machine did not work.  I give a 3.5 out of 5 star.,1
Bed was so hard couldn't sleep. Room next door crying screaming child also made it worse. Walls looked like peeling. Pool not open.,0
Room had no bath soap| shampoos was empty and I saw hair pins on the floor| which indicated that cleaning was poor.,0
Room is cozy but it's lacking pillows and a decent comforter for a King bed.,1
for those who like to walk| walking distance to Tysons corner; friendly staff; clean rooms; limited service (pool closed| restaurants closed| no breakfast| etc)  in light of covid,1
Three hour wait for my room. The customer service at the bar was terrible.,0
Very comfortable & clean but just wasn't comfortable with bed to hard couldn't sleep there both nights back was hurting from bed hard had to go home to my own bed so lost money on that other night .. staff was great though just need to upgrade the beds .. an refrigerator didn't work in my room .. an microwave was in the hallway for the entire hotel ..,1
Beautiful hotel for the price point; very clean| decent size rooms| nice gym area and friendly staff. There is lovley lounge/dining ares to socially distance| eat| have a cocktail| or do some work off of a laptap. The food was good|  certainly not cheap| but about at the price point for a room service menu at a typical hotel.If I could make one critique and recommendation| it would be that the bath towels were very rough for some reason| and I suggest addressing  the issue.Other than than that| one of the best parts of your stay will be to enjoy free parking right on the hotel property! Highly recommend and will stay again.,1
It was perfect for our last minute getaway and very close to Fogo de Ch√£o where we had dinner reservations.,1
Love this hotel. I will definitely stay here whenever I am in the area. Very clean| quiet| and comfortable. Staff is incredibly friendly and helpful.,1
Great stay and the staff's communication was excellent,1
Property and room was very clean. No complaints about the stay. Room prices were reasonable| location was good. I wish hotel had breakfast however there are plenty of places nearby with breakfast options,1
Great customer service and clean room. The front desk greeted me so well :),1
Property was nice. Absolutely no amenities during a COVID stay. No housekeeping| no room service| no restaurant service... And you have to go to front desk for anything you need.  Nice property| but rather return when things improve. Other hotels still have better service,1
A very nice stay. Very accommodating despite Covid closing a lot of things. They made sure everything was sanitized. Thank you again!!,1
I won't go back again| I was expecting more from Hilton.However it is over my trip and it is just wasting time to talk about it.,0
Terrible service and very disgusting hotel. I would not recommend it,0
My family and I chose to stay overnight in Mclean as we were driving back from a getaway. I chose this hotel specifically as they have an onsite restaurant (w outdoor seating) and an indoor pool. We've traveled to a few destinations over the past few months| and have been pleased with the accommodations. Given the state of the pandemic| I read all of the hotel info carefully and thoroughly prior to booking| to ensure the safety of my family (specifically my two children.) I previously lived in Mclean| so I am familiar with the Tyson's Corner location| but what I wasn't anticipating was the shabby exterior and the uninterested front desk attendant WHO WAS TERRIBLE. I expressed my displeasure with the fact that the restaurant and pool were closed| and there was no room service avail- as this was the ONLY reason we booked this hotel. He shrugged and said we could pick a snack from makeshift pantry next door. Listen| I get the Covid circumstances| but you're in customer service| at least pretend to give a shiz. My husband was so livid about his dismissive behavior| that he had to walk away. We managed to find a close din spot in walking distance (thanks Yelp!) that helped ease the disappointed. The rooms were standard and the hotel itself is very sterile (and not just because it's washed in Purell.) Also| I thought it was hilarious that they charge $3 for a pour-it-yourself coffee in the AM. I mean| even Motel 6 gives you free coffee... I just expect much more from a Hilton.,0
Very nice stay.  The only thing missing are the little things that make an overnight stay really comfortable| bottled water in room| a newspaper to relax with| body wash or bath soap to accompany the shampoo and conditioner dispensers would be a plus.  We used the shampoo to shower with.,1
Great location- easy access to shooed| restaurants. The rooms are clean| bed comfortable. No noise was able to get a good rest.,1
very friendly and open with exchanging our rooms when there was a mix up,1
Room was clean and comfortable. Staff was friendly and welcoming. Minor power outage but it was taken care of fairly quickly. Check-in and check-out were a breeze. Only downside was the small fridge and no microwave.,1
The room was very clean and comfortable. My only complaint is the air didnt get really cold and the bathroom was a little small. Other than that| my stay was very pleasant.,1
Room was dirtyAc not working Refrigerator not working Hair in the bedTub broken,0
Great hotel| great customer service| but the design provides no reprieve to occupants when there are loud people in the common area. Because it is enclosed and all doors/walkways look down into the common area| all the noise can easily be heard in each room. This wouldn't be a problem if the noise was enforced by staff| but they allow children and adults alike to yell and holler until| as I was informed by staff| midnight. The Five to Fitness room is great and well-equipped and the room cleaning service is great. Other than noise enforcement after normal quiet hours (10PM isn't unreasonable)| the staff have been super helpful and cheerful| especially considering the current situation. I'd recommend this hotel to others.,1
Great place| we will always stay here from now on when visiting VA,1
Amazing accomadation| good service| friendly environment| Crystal  clean  and|  accessible location. I highly recommend it!,1
The facility was really warm. We couldn't adjust our room below 65 degrees| and even with the thermostat set there| it didn't feel very cool. We asked the hotel to look into this| and they said they'd sent the engineer up| but nothing really changed. We had to ask for lighter blankets to sleep with. Overall| it was multiple calls and a headache for limited resolution. That's never been my experience at a Hilton| so I was disappointed.,0
Since all of the hotels rooms open to the lobby it gets loud with the slightest noise down in the lobby. Otherwise it was ok. Night shift worker seemed to be irritated that I was checking out at night and not in the morning,1
It was really nice place to stsy in and the room was smazing,1
Shuttle service was amazing! Drivers were very friendly and informative. Desk staff very friendly and helpful as well. Room as clean and fresh and the hotel is overall very well kept up. The restaurant in the hotel is fabulous. Highly recommend!,1
Great service and atmosphere,1
The hotel is amazing when you walk in very welcome in and the rooms were Amazing very clean and smelled amazing,1
Excellent choice|  place to stay in the Tysons Corner|  VA area.,1
One of the best hotels I stayed in!! Felt very relaxed,1
Very nice hotel.  Room was very clean and comfy.  Will definitely stay here again,1
The staff was particularly attentive and helpful.  The room was very clean and comfortable. The food in the restaurant downstairs was excellent.  I give this hotel the highest rating!,1
Nice spacious room| comfy bed| great restaurant with wonderful service (Maria is a gem!)| quiet at night...,1
Great stay| easy parking and great facilities all around,1
Loved the lobby and restaurants. Great location|  close to  Tysons Galleria where there is many fine restaurants and shopping.,1
After being displaced by a power outage| the hotel was welcoming and restful.,1
The hotel was Amazing| it looked exactly like the pictures online.  Well worth the money,1
Not enough coffee in room,1
I was able to check in early | and check out at 12 pm. the room service was great and the staff was on point.,1
Great hotel. Still disappointed from staff. No interaction at all. You have to pull a smile from them being at check in with no welcoming at all or during your stay. Very neutral,1
The only complaint I have is the staff member who checked us in kept reminding me ‚Äúsince you booked through a third-party‚Äù that my Hilton Honors number was essentially worthless and I may not get free internet as a result.  I found this annoying| as after combing through a long list of hotels I CHOSE Hilton| but was treated like a second class citizen due to ‚Äúbooking third party.‚Äù  She told me like three times.üòÇ,1
Great location. Did not get to interact with staff except at check in and house keeping that would keep trying to get in my room despite the do not disturb sign,1
My stay was wonderful I would recommend staying there great location.,1
Won't Want to stay next time,0
Really enjoyed the shuttle service!!  Really close to the metro so heading into DC was a breeeze.. Durning non rush hours..,1
Great location with free parking. Nice bar atmosphere. Clean rooms and lobby area. We'll kept property.,1
My girlfriend and I previously stayed in this hotel|  had an amazing experience| especially for the price! So naturally we were excited to stay here again. Unfortunately this time around wasn't so great. We booked in advance for a king room| checked in| went up to find two beds. Not a big deal| so we called the front desk only to be told they were out of king rooms for the night| call back in the morning. Very shortly after we discovered the toilet in the room didn't work (kept running| wouldn't flush). Called the front desk again and a maintenance person came to ‚Äúfix‚Äù it| needless to say we ended up in another room. Next room was so dusty my girlfriend sneezed most of the night but we sucked it up. Next morning we called the front desk to see about finally getting our king room| it was available but that meant packing up and moving rooms again. Overall this experience was very disappointing especially since our first time was so great. I'm really not sure that we'd ever stay here again. Our stay was Fri-Sun| 3 different rooms is kind of unacceptable.,0
The pillows too soft everything else good.,1
Wow! I booked this room because of the high rating from Expedia! $230 plus dollars for one night! Cut my foot on an exposed carpet strip nail after getting out of the shower. The renovation was not recently competed per the ‚ÄùReese‚Äùthe building engineer! They had several reasons why they could NOT offer me a free night! What a disappointment,0
Rooms are old. and bit of a let down compared to the ambiance of the hotel,1
Really beautiful location and liked the fact that I didn't have to pay extra to park.  Right across the street from a great coffee shop.  Food was a little overpriced for my taste| but it is what it is.  Overall it was a great experience and would go back if I visit the area again.,1
The glass elevators were cool. The breakfast for $28.00 was a little over priced for a glass of water and some eggs and bacon.,1
I stayed here for my Washington DC weekend trip. The original plan was to stay one night| so when my plan had changed and had to extend two more nights| I didn't hesitate to choose this hotel again because location| rooms| and service were all excellent. Plus| plenty of parking spaces were available near front and back entrances| so easy access was guaranteed. And there are plenty of seating area(sofas and tables) in lobby area| which was helpful if you have to rearrange your bags or wait for someone for a while. Although breakfast was not included and it felt a little bit pricey considering the average food options| the service I got from the breakfast server was amazing; very professional| friendly and helpful. Location was superb; Tyson's corner has big shopping malls and only 20-30 mins to Washington DC. I will definitely come back here next time I visit this area.,1
It's Clean and Spacious. The Free Shuttle Bus is A Big Help to Hotel Residents. I Suggest | just like other Hilton Hotels| there should be free 2 Bottles of Mineral Water | and a Complimentary Coffee and Tea Every Day. But In General | Service is Good. Specially the Front Desk| they are Very Helpful.,1
Restaurant onsite| indoor pool| gym and shuttle service.,1
The lobby bar| the room Service excelent. The Service check in and check out excelent.,1
We were very disappointed with our stay (2/5 points)Cons:1) Surprised to see WiFi charges if you are staying but WiFi in hotel lobby was free2) At 2:30 am some drunk guy was banging on hotel rooms| yelling and being obnoxious. Obviously| it woke us up. This went one for a good 30 mins yet hotel security was missing. We reported it to the reception that was least bothered. Hotel management must immediately take action to address security concerns.3) Cleanliness: Room wasn't cleaned properly which we did report but we didn't want to dwell on it since we checked in late and had to leave early morning.4) Amenities: maybe it's  a new trend but I haven't come across it yet. Shampoo and conditioner bottles were fixed/locked in the shower like gym facilities have in their showers as oppose to tiny shampoo bottles etc. No big deal but it takes away from feeling staying in a luxury hotel vs budget motelsPros:Good location| free parking and nice covered pool!,0
The decor is nice| modern facility| the room view was bad| a wall... we did not eat there so I cannot comment,1
Clean and nice! Great price as well. Definitely recommend!!!,1
Easy check in| quiet lobby - room service was great - friendly staff. Great french press coffee!,1
Great location| very reasonable rates.   The staff was friendly and polite.  Free parking is a huge bonus in this area.  Great proximity to Tysons Corner Center.    The room was very big| and the TV was very nice.,1
Clean room with lovely| warm lighting in the bathroom. Lobby is stunning and makes it hard to look away.,1
We were in town to visit family for the holidays but previously lived in the MD/VA area so we were somewhat familiar with the area. There was a misunderstanding on my end with what room I thought I was booking and the gentleman at the front desk| I believe his name was Nick| was great!! He took us to see two separate rooms that we could have instead of the one assigned to us and really went above and beyond. Everyone was courteous and polite throughout our check in and out experience. The only issue we had was with the restaurant on site. There seemed to be a lot of difficult customers there| for breakfast on Christmas morning| and it took longer to get our food| than what I felt was appropriate. Other than that we would definitely stay here again and at other Hilton's as well.,1
Friendly and efficient staff. Room was amazing and super clean. Definitely going to come back,1
Great stay| enjoyed the hotel,1
Beautiful view from the glass elevator Drinks were expensive,1
Very nice and great location. Staff was great and room was nice,1
Everything about the hotel was great. Only complaint is hotels.com advertised free wifi but the front desk claimed the free wifi wasn't for third party reservations.,1
Management has no regard for the safety of its guests.,0
We stayed here two times within a week of each other because the location was great and the hotel met all our expectations.,1
Clean| friendly| great lounge/ Bar area.  Bar keep very knowledgable,1
Service was mean. There was a wedding and maybe they're were tired. At almost all check in they tell you where the elevators are. They didn't. When I asked I got a ‚Äúwhat're yu blind?‚Äù Look and an arm pointing there. Sorry but there are many hotels that have multiple elevator banks,0
I was surprised to find out there was no Jacuzzi| and the bar did not open until 3pm.  Also| the host at the dining restaurant was rude to the guest before| and quite abrupt with us.  We sat down only to realize the menu prices were high| orange juice $5.00 etc.  So we decided to eat elsewhere.  The rooms were comfortable; and the space was quiet.  The lifeguard was very nice.  Overall| our stay was good.,1
Beautiful hotel| found hair in tub which was a total turnoff but other than that it was perfect.,1
Pros: Close to highway so getting around was easy.  Rooms were nice. Plenty of free parking was great. Pool and gym was niceCons: Room wasn't clean e.g. phone had stains and if you move the phone| the area underneath was sticky. Maybe a one off over sight but it does make you wonder about the rest of the staff. We searched the room for 2 adults and 2 kids. Booked the room with breakfast included option. However| when we got to the facility| we were surprised to find out that breakfast was only for 2 adults and had to pay for 2 kids though half the price but 12.50 for a kid who only had cereal is not fair.  Pillows weren't comfortable,1
Room was great just felt ready damp.,1
Nice hotel and staff. Would stay again if I'm in the area,1
Great location! Room AC not easily controlled| took long time to go either way. Not a hotel for vacation or family| too business oriented. Front desk people not polite nor concern about customer care in general.,1
Beautiful Hotel!  I will be booking there again on my next visit to VA!,1
The facility was clean and very pretty. The room was absolutely comfortable and spacious. The staff was awesome. I'd definitely go back!,1
Short stay but service was fantastic. Friendly staff| clean room| and excellent location.,1
Highly recommended,1
Really nice hotel| can't complain. Really good for the price,1
We used the McLean Metro station for DC trips. Hotel shuttle service was never less than a 30 minute wait at the station. Just be prepared. Hotel and staff were otherwise excellent.,1
"Stayed over weekend and it was disappointing. Exceedingly weak water pressure in the shower. Cheap toilet paper and tissues. Room cleaning was not provided by 3 pm and then| while we were in the room for 30 min| we got the note that they will not clean at all| out of ""respect to our privacy"".",0
There is nothing bad to say: it's clean| it's convenient| the prices are more than fair| it has enormous value! My only wish| would be| that they offer free hi-speed WiFi.,1
It was an amazing & beautiful hotel with the most wonderful staff but there were just a few things i would have changed. The tv had horrible reception| there wasn't a microwave| & the shower head only sprayed straight out (not down).,1
Great location close to shopping and restaurants| as well as Metro and public transportation. Excellent room and very nice lobby lounge.,1
Overall a great hotel,1
Beautiful hotel rooms smallish but v clean and comfortable. Room service spotty,1
We ate at the hotel restaurant| staffs are very friendly. When they knew my daughter needed to leave at 6:00 a.m. in the morning| before the breakfast hour| they offered food from the pantry free of charge for her. That's is a nice touch !,1
During a major power outage| they managed to accommodate the usual out of town guests and very earnestly try to take in as many locals as they could.  Great staff.,1
It was our home away from home as we were without power,1
HIlton Meclen Tyson Corner is one of my favorite hotels!!,1
This hotel is in need of some updating| but Hilton probably knows that. The room was comfortable and the staff was friendly.,1
It was a good one.  Thankful for the shuttle transportation.üòä,1
Beautiful hotel in the middle of Tysons.  The malls are five minutes away.  Parking is excellent.  The staff is amazing and the bar is exceptional.  Beautiful place!,1
The fire alarm woke me up at 5am. It rang for a long time and I called front desk 3 Times to confirm that I should evacuate and come to the lobby. I did that and was told everything was fine. The fire alarm rang again half an hour later and I didn't bother going downstairs a second time. This isn't necessarily a bad review| because I understand they have to take all precautions Incase of an actual fire but it made for a very exhausting day for me the next day| due to interrupted sleep.,0
It was a great stay and the staff was very kind and helpful but for such a high class hotel they should have some more complimentary stuff available to everyone and not just members. Like breakfast| wifi| etc. overall| it was a good stay,1
The McLean Hilton is an excellent hotel located right in the Tyson's Corner shipping complex.  I arrived on Friday night and spent time at the bar located right off the lobby. Room was equipped with King Bed (terrific mattress/pillows) small refrigerator| coffee express. Room layout open just the right size for single/couple.  Saturday breakfast was excellent with buffet selection.  You will always pay more but for the food| convenience decor it is worth it! Staff very friendly & responsive requests.  The only thing you need to look for is the big swings in nightly cost - hotel.com can help with that.  The Hilton Hotel is one of my favorites in the McLean/DC area.,1
Excellent stay at this hotel. Nice and clean. Friendly staff,1
Amazing stay! Highly recommend! Will stay in a future again!!!,1
It was lovely! The staff was so nice and they made our wedding weekend the most wonderful experience!,1
Nice place|  the bed sheets were a little rough and the matress was a little stiff but everything else was nice,1
We stayed over night as a getaway for our anniversary. The hotel is in a great location and has free parking. The staff was very pleasant and check in was easy. Thebdecore of the hotel is a little dated| but it's still a nice looking facility. Our room was spacious| clean and comfortable. The view was of the parking lot and I-495| so that was too exciting but not a big deal for us. The bed was comfortable but the pillows were pretty bad. They flattened out and gave no support. The main complaint is that we had to pay $9.99 for one device to access the WiFi. I think wireless access should be free for guests.,1
The hotel was beautiful and very clean. I enjoyed my stay very much. The only criticism I have is that the front desk workers were not very friendly.,1
Amazing hotel with friendly staff and very clean rooms. The locations is great and very elegant in the inside. Also parking is free so would definitely recommend it to anyone,1
There was a mix up at the front desk because we booked through Priceline| will not do this again. The manager was extremely kind and helpful. The room was nice| clean| fresh smelling. We did use the pool and felt confident it was clean and well maintained. There was a life guard as well. We were told the pool temperature was 86 degrees but the water and air in the room felt much colder. We also talked to other guests who felt the same. It could've been warmer. We didn't stay in long because of it being cold. Nice service though and would definitely recommend it or stay there again.,1
The stay was great and the hotel was really nice. I would definitely stay again and the customer service was top notch from beginning to end.,1
Close to everything.  Shopping at Tysons Corner. Plenty of Restaurants| and close to Wash. D.C| and sites outside the beltway.  Very neat and clean.  Would stay there again.,1
Decor was fabulous. Very pleasant and welcoming atmosphere.,1
Convenience| Hotel has shuttle bus to the Mall| Closed to metro!,1
Thanking you for the opportunity to submit this feedback|,1
Nice staff| clean rooms| nice location.  The hotel was appropriate for the price.,1
One of the best hotels we have ever stayed at,1
Our trip was only one night and it was perfect. The only small complaint we had was that the room smelled like cigarette smoke and we were in a non-smoking room. The front desk was very helpful noting that in our account so we were not charged. Everything was extremely clean and the staff was very helpful!,1
Will book again,1
Comfortable| nice area but it was an small room. The service is very good and helpful. The hotel in general is nice and clean. The bar in the middle of the lobby is great| also the gym|  but the pool is indoor| would be nice if half of the pool was outdoor.,1
The hotel was great. The only issue I had was our room was on the 2nd floor right at the balcony for the lobby below. There were seating areas in the lobby that were used late into the night| so the noise from those in the lobby could be heard in our room into the late night hours.,1
beautiful and clean hotel.  The food & drink in the restaurant however was way over priced.,1
Hotel very pretty| but staff needs to get their act together.  Got the distinct impression they didn't feel the need to be concerned about customers that didn't book directly with Hilton - I have been a long time Hilton customer and was very disappointed that I picked that hotel to put our out of town friends in.,0
I only ate in the restaurant once - early evening| had light fare| which was tasty| accompanied by a nice wine at happy hour prices.,1
Horrible experience. Health was compromised.,0
The room was a little small| but nice and quiet.,1
This is a beautiful property and we will definitely return when we are in the area. Our only complaint was the Wi-Fi fee.,1
Love the scenery,1
Room itself nice.,0
I reserved in this hotel 4 nights.  I had an impression that it is in the hear of Tyson  Corner.  That was the first surprise.  It was not.  It was in in a deserted area in Mclean.  At check in| the lady in the reception tried to persuade me to upgrade with additional money and hinting that the room I reserved is not that good.  With agood intention| I accepted the upgrade but found that she gave me a small accessible room for handicapped and not for people like me.  The room has small bathroom| small iron board and no thing especially great about it.  She offered a better suite but for much higher rate. Coming from a long distance| I decided to take the accessible room for a night and either change or checkout. In my attempt to check out and find a better hotel| they objected and told me that I will be charged an extra night regardless of the time of departure unless I complete 4 days.  The old lady in the reception was rude and non understanding.  I decided to wait and speak with the lady who checked me in hoping that she will be more understanding.  I did speak with her at night after 2 day stay and explained to her that I want to check out next day.  She initially refused but then agreed to speak to her supervisor and get call me in my room.  I waited the whole night and she never called me.  Apparently| she was trying to buy time as she was going to be away for the next 2 days and by the time she is back the 4 days have been completed and I would have checked out.,0
Very nice hotel and staff and plenty of parking great location,1
The gym was very nice| plenty of equipment ( but nothing to wipe down the machines)| water| towels.  The pool was very nice as well. We went during Presidents Weekend and there was a promotional discount and the cost was under $100. The parking was free- rare in these areas.  The wifi was not free which is weird in this day and age but we are Hilton Honors members as well so they gave us a promo code.  I would definitely stay again even if it was a bit more.  We have stayed all over DC and Virginia.  I would say this hotel is in the top 5.,1
amazing. nothing to complain about.,1
I upgraded my room to include internet access| but after the upgrade they told me I have to pay separately to have access. Very disappointing.,0
Our stay was great! Only con was that the silver line is a bit of a walk from the hotel and the shuttle stops running at 10:30. But everything was excellent!,1
This is a beautiful 5star hotel with a great restaurant. They aren't on the metro| though| and it is impossible to walk because the area is not pedestrian friendly. We waited an hour for the shuttle the first night. Our non smoking room smelled like marijuana.  There is no coffee in the room.,1
The hotel is a little hard to find| set back in an executive business cul-de-sac area. But the hotel itself is clean| updated| corner rooms are large and the staff was helpful. Beware of the OVERPRICED drinks and food at the lobby bar/lounge!!,1
My husband and I enjoyed staying here. It was quiet| clean| comfortable and beautifully decorated. We liked that parking was complimentary. We would stay here again.,1
The ladies lobby area is extremely beautiful! The beds were comfortable. I loved the rotating TV so you could watch from anywhere in the room,1
The hotel was very nice. 5 minute drive to Tysons Mall. However| being forced to pay for WiFi while in your room was very inconvenient for someone who has to work while staying.,1
Very clean| nice restaurants| great rooms and wifi was free if you sign up for the Hilton rewards program.  Parking is free and ample.,1
Only a brief overnight while traveling. I want to come back next time I'm in the area.  A gem of a hotel with excellent staff and reasonable rates.  Definitely a prime representation of the Hilton Brand I trust and prefer.,1
I would be helpful if you allowed your guests to access the HDMI ports in the TVs.,1
Nice hotel| good location.  A quick overnight on a business trip.  Ordered room service and was shocked to see a 21% service charge plus $5.  So my room service charges were 29%.  I won't be back.,1
"Stayed for a week at the McLean Hilton with my wife and 2 year-old son. Was a bit surprised when the generally unhelpful staff informed me they would not heat up a new| unopened bottle of milk for my kid's cereal...  Was a LOT surprised when the staff subsequently decided to add insult to injury by chastising me for 'not checking with the hotel ahead of time' to ensure they could accommodate the apparently Herculean task of warming 6 ounces of milk.  I guess I must have been in the wrong for assuming a routine| basic guest service that any Motel 6 could have done with a microwave surely must be within the realm of the possible @ Ye Olde Hilton... I would have kept it in mind for my next stay| except that won't be happening because they also refused to add any points whatsoever to my HHonors account because I booked through Expedia.  Sorta limits the ""Honor""-part of their whole program.  Looks like I will have to be satisfied by the Front Office Manager who wrote me a few days later to inform me he would look into ""...how it was possible that we could not find a way to accommodate you  with a most basic request .""  Keep looking| Brother. Please mail me any updates to my new address care/of Hyatt.",0
I just wish they had free wifi. $9.99/day and if you arrive in the afternoon| not pro-rated.,1
NO free WIFI| rooms are. If and rates fair,1
It's a good place to stay. The rooms are clean and staff is friendly. We had no problems checking in or out.,1
the room was clean and in excellent condition I would recommend this hotel to anybody,1
This was a very nice hotel.  We were very satisfied with our stay.,1
It was great I would book again,1
Hotel staff was nice and accommodating.  No matter what time of day or night they were still friendly and available.  Had to book the room for another night and it was easy to do.,1
"The Hilton McLean Tysons Corner was absolutely beautiful from the design of the room and the overall hotel all the way down to the service. I must say that I was impressde! I was so amazed at the fact that I was able to pay such a low rate for such an upscale hotel. Upon entering the room everything was clean and tidy| and during my stay| housekeeping managed to keep it that way while my partner and I were out of the room. The bathroom was absolutely perfect and the shower was relaxing too! The best part of the room| obviously| was the bed. It was very comfortable! So| if you are looking for a nice getaway for some down time in a location that's in between suburbs and the city| then this location is great. There's immediate access to the metro to get into the city just by using the shuttle or if you just want to do a little shopping & grap a bite to eat you could head over to one of the 2 malls surrounding the hotel. All in all| I would be pleased to come back to this hotel for another ""stay-cation getaway"" with my boyfriend!",1
Stayed here with my daughter's travel soccer team.  A beautiful hotel.  I was able to receive early check-in and when our team wanted to gather for a pizza party downstairs they were very accommodating!  Would definitely stay here again!,1
great| rooms great access to the metro and shopping,1
Very Nice! We would visit again.,1
The hotel building and the rooms are well designed and kept very clean.  The hotel staff provide a high quality of courteous service to its guests.  Free parking as well as shuttle service is available. It is also located near one of the upscale malls.,1
overall everything excellent| just little bit I fet staff was not that friendly manner...,1
This place is great. Clean and comfy! Great service! Shower was awesome! My girlfriend and I went there for some much needed R&R and thats all we got!,1
good stay| clean| nice| clise to DC and great falls National park.,1
Hilton Tysons Corner (McLean) is a good hotel. Excellent staff| good location if you are happy to do short walks to local businesses| and a shuttle if you'd rather not (especially in the hot summers!). Two excellent malls nearby with diverse dining options. Near the Silver Metro with direct access to downtown DC. I got to Dupont Circle in under 40 minutes. Plenty of taxis| and about 15 -20 mins from Dulles.,1
We had a lovely time at the Hilton McLean Tysons Corner.  I love how everything is available electronically.,1
Overnight business trip stay to McLean - Hotel was near location of event,1
I always stay at this hotel for its proximity to everything you like such as shopping |restaurants| sightseeing and more importantly it is 10 mins drive to DC :),1
It was quick| only one night.  The hotel staff could not have been nicer.,1
Beautiful hotel| close to shopping and only 25 minute train ride to D.C. Best way to experience D.C. without staying in the city.   Hotel buffet adequate| but overpriced.,1
This has been one of my favorite hotels. It is conveniently located with lots of amenity nearby.,1
I alway stay in tyson's corner when visiting the d|c metro area. It is now accessible by the metro. This is a plus .the Hilton is nicer than the Hyatt. I have stayed at both.,1
"This stay was in celebration of our 12th year Wedding Anniversary. Upon check-in| I casually mentioned it to Agnieszka ""Auga"" Karnecka. I am a business traveler and have stayed at numerous hotels. Most hotel employees are nice because it is their job| however| I want it known that Auga went above & beyond to make our anniversary special. I am a member of numerous loyalty programs| but because of Auga's actions| I will ALWAYS use this Hilton whenever I have guests or business clients come into town. I'm sure you already know what a gem you have in Auga| but in case you don't know| now you know.",1
Our stay was nice. The bathroom was clean. The hotel restaurant was outstanding. The overall hotel was clean and comfortable. The pillows were a little small. I would suggest this hotel to family and friends.,1
Enjoy shopping malls close to hotel and easy walk.  Great restaurants within walking distance from hotel.  Parking lot was self parking that was great,1
We stayed over the weekend for visiting Washington DC. Two families| two rooms but the rooms were connected to each other - perfectly works for us. Close to highway| easy to get everywhere. Love the location| love the price| free parking| recommend.,1
It was a girls weekend to go shopping. We met out goals. This is a place I would recommend to family and friends,1
We have been staying in this hotel every time we go to Tyson's Corners| and always we find excellent service| from the guest services to the cleaning crew! great place!!,1
Wanted a nice| budget oriented hotel for a quick Washington DC getaway; this was the perfect spot. The hotel was extremely modern| with great amenities and a nice location.,1
Clean| new| nice staff. Public area is great.,1
Pool was very warm| clean and staff available for life guarding as well as handing out hood size towels.,1
Sleek and chic hotel and rooms.  I would definitely recommend and re-visit. Free Wi-fi not available in rooms| however; I found it to be refreshing| because my spouse and I were not busy searching the web| checking social media| or updating social media statuses.  We were able to engage| connect| and socialize with each other| which was relaxing and very much needed because technology wasn't in our way!!! We needed to use the computer to print something and computers and a printer are available in the Hotel's Tech Center free of charge. Oh and I had the best fruit cup of my life there| the honeydew and cantaloupe were both ripe and sweet!!!,1
WiFi is not free.,1
If you plan on bring food or taking food back to the hotel to eat later. Just forget about it there's no way to warm up your food at all. Not one microwave in the whole building ..,1
All the staff was wonderful!!!!,1
Amazing hotel. Staff there is very friendly| professional and accommodating. I will only be staying here next time I am in the area,1
The stay was nice and peaceful. Was unaware of the deposit that had to be paid at the time of booking. The faucet in the bathroom has a green build up around where the water actually comes out. Not sure if that will later become a health concern. Not even sure what will cause the build up in the line.,1
Relaxing,1
A very nice hotel - only reservation (no pun intended) location remote mass transit to washington but great if you want to shop in tysons area,1
This hotel is close to shopping and lots of great food options!,1
We came for Georgetown graduation so we didn't spend time in this neighborhood.,1
The bed was super comfy! The room was laid out very efficiently and was quite comfortable. Just wish it wasn't so dusty.,1
We had an absolutely lovely time there. Staff was exceptionally attentive and kind!Great swimming pool. Lots of coupons for food to eat downstairs. The neighborhood is excellent,1
We arrived late for check-in so we went to the hotel restaurant. Mistake. It was beautiful but PRICEY! The pan seared trout was great!I didn't get a chance to try the bar because their was a party going on the second night and I felt highly under-dressed. :-) A+ amenities. Polite and courteous staff. This hotel was worth every penny which didn't break the bank with a deal from Hotels.com.Beautiful room that included a couch for lounging so you're not stuck on the bed the entire time. 42' flat screen TV with Directv...free parking...minutes from the McLean and Tysons Corner Metro station. I was able to park my car and ride the shuttle. Text the shuttle and they will pick you up!Great place for business meetings| conferences...if you're hungry and don't wanna leave the hotel...just hit up the pantry in the lobby and charge it to the room! I was able to check out using Guest Service on the TV in my room. How cool was that!I would recommend to anyone looking for a great place to stay minutes from DC to save money on lodging! Great staff...great location! A+,1
check out time was 12:00 pm. At 9:30am we heard a loud knock at the door and it was the people who clean the room. why would you wake someone up at 9:30am and check in is at 12:00pm.,0
Took my daughter for a girls weekend to American girl store and cafe. Had the AG doll package and hotel was fantastic at having everything in our room to make it extra special. Great location of hotel. Staff was great!,1
Overall great hotel. Had no problems at all. I would forsure choose this hotel whenever i go back to the d.c. area.,1
Location is perfect if you want proximity to Tyson's Corner Center for shopping| across the street you can find a very good cafe. The rooms as spacious and very quiet for a good rest.,1
Friendly staff -Brooke was amazing|great location| good food| no complaints.,1
I recommended it for you when you staying in DC. üëçüëçüëç,1
Very clean| very nice bed and sheets smell fresh!,1
They were amazing ! 10/10 would recommend,1
The area was amazing| along with the actual hotel and what all it offered!,1
That services are great. It's the block it's on that's not so great and the size of the rooms are tiny,1
This hotel was amazing. Right on Chinatown and cross the street from the metro station so easy to go around. The rooms are a little small but staff were so nice and the rooms were clean. They also have a rooftop| restaurant and a bar that plays live music sometimes. One of the best hotel I been and will stay there again.,1
The stay was comfortable.  The parking was around the corner from the Motto but within a 4 minute walk.  The ontime fee allowed unlimited access.,1
location was perfect| just a few blocks from the national mall and surrounded by great restaurants (farmers and distillers and jaleo were favorites of my partner and i). room was quite small but worked fine for what i needed and the price couldn't be beat for the quality. staff was perfect and went above and beyond.,1
The staff was incredible and really helpful! Will be staying here again!,1
Staff was extremely friendly,1
I loved how friendly the staff was as they were very welcoming. The rooms were also really clean although we did not expect how small it was at first when we booked it. I would stay here again though!,1
Located in a great area,1
Loved it. Have all ready recommended it to my friends.,1
Comfy| enjoyable and have a lot to do in the area.,1
I only needed a one night stay and researched online. I chose Motto because of the price and location. I read reviews and people had complained about the lack of parking. Since I came up on the train it wasn't an issue. I also read reviews about lack of cleanliness but I found the room and hotel to be very clean; no dust in the corners| no soap scum. It was tiny but I expected that. I didn't need a room to hang out in  because I had things to do in DC. It was a place to sleep and take a shower and it met my needs. I had dinner in the restaurant on the lobby level and it was great. The rooftop bar had stunning views and was a lot of fun. The staff from the front desk to the bartenders were lovely and most friendly. Key cards were needed to gain access to the elevators so I felt safe. Not a good view from my room but it didn't matter to me. I would definitely stay here again but the little bunk bed room would not be a place to hang out unless you want to stay in bed and watch tv| in which case would be very comfortable. I slept well and heard nothing from any other room or in he hall as I was on the end Totally met my needs.,1
The rooms are small but also cute and comfortable. The hotel is in a great location| the subway is across the street| there is a Walgreens around the corner and good restaurants in the area. The restaurant inside the hotel is pretty good too. Also they have a small coffee shop that is open in the mornings. I stayed for 4 days with my 10 yr old daughter and we have no complaints. The only downside was that there are homeless people on that street| But it still felt safe. I always notice police officers in the area. My daughter and I loved our stay.,1
We really enjoyed our stay at Motto in DC. It was close enough to the things we wanted to do that we could walk| and right next to a metro station. On the down side| parking for 3 days in the recommended facility across the street cost $75 extra dollars.,1
very clean| convenient location| front staff was so kind.I stayed one queen bed room with two adults| this room was very tiny| I couldn't even open suitcase !,1
Very nice service| very nice room| very nice location!,1
Like the rest of DC... It was not a good neighborhood,1
This hotel was awesome!  It was very clean| neat and efficient.  I loved the newly renovated rooms.  There were five of us and we were all pleased with our room.  It was an effective use of space; comfortable bed| desk| storage and a beautiful bathroom.  The designers did a great job!  I can't say enough about the front desk personnel.  Jenni| Ishobel| and Brooke were very friendly| informative and very accommodating.,1
Friendly staff and easy access to the train| national mall| and tons of great restaurants. They even have a roof top bar and a breakfast cafe. Highly recommend!!,1
Great place to stay for DC. Right next to China Town gate and really close to the Mall etc. Not luxurious by any means but just exactly what we needed for our trip. Walgreens is next door if you need to stock up on stuff and cheaper food but the hotel's cafe was excellent also| for breakfast and coffees. Also a very safe place to stay; key access to building| elevators and room.,1
Very small room and the parking situation was annoying but I was grateful that they partnered with a local parking garage for an affordable rate of $29. Also the front desk employee Brooke was such a pleasure- provided great service and was very knowledgeable.,1
Excellent location and access to everything.,1
Very clean| friendly staff|  small size bedrooms but worth to stay. Convenience!!! Close to everything. Foods| Walgreens next door| transportation‚Ä¶üòä,1
"Staff friendly| accommodating and helpful. They saw my friend's wheelchair and our luggage and offered us a larger room.  No fridge in room| but extra luggage space under bed. Good wifi and outlets. Close to Chinatown metro and ""Farmers and Distillers"" and Clyde's restaurants; walking distance from Smithsonian.",1
Great hotel. It was very clean and modern. Make sure you pay attention to the room picture. It is a small room but is just like the picture. But we were out all the time| so we were there just to sleep.,1
Small but modern clean and practical room. The girls at the front desk were very kind and helpful.,1
Excellent all around| highly recommend.,1
Prefect for us. Just what we need| good location| a bed to sleep in| a low price| clean and super friendly staff. The room is small| but for us exploring all day and only sleeping in the hotel it's perfect for the price. The only thing that could be better is if breakfast would be included.,1
We loved the small efficient rooms well-located near transportation and convenient dining. Staff was first-rate. Place was very clean and friendly. Will stay again.,1
Brooke & Ysabel made us feel so welcomed as we checked in and in fact| greeted us with a smile as we come in and out of the building.  They looked after our luggage after check out to have a few more last minute stroll in the area on our last day. The hotel itself has a modern| new and clean ambiance.  We were able to enjoy the great coffee and great service at the Crimson Cafe and also enjoyed the view till sunset at the Penthouse.  We highly recommend Motto and will come back to this same location| which was close to the Metro Station as well.  Our stay was very memorable because we made a good choice for our hotel.  Thanks to all the amazing staff esp at the front desk!,1
excellent location| friendly staff and clean room.,1
Forst time ever that the pictures on the website match the rooms. This is a great place to stay right in the heart of Chinatown. Mere steps from the metro. Very convenient. We loved our stay and will stay again.,1
This type of situations| are unacceptable. Be sure it will not happen to guests of hotel in future. If you would like a private consulting with detailed explanation ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù Feel free to contact  me via email and we can discuss rates.,0
Very clean and near everything,1
I loved the reception by Ms. Raquel Walsh| who has been most helpful throughout my stay here.Please pass her my compliments!,1
Room was great overall but way too small,1
Small but super comfortable room.,1
The room view| and rooms were very small. And i didnt feel that is clearly explained upfront| that rooms are very small.,1
I had a great stay at the Motto. Excellent location and the front desk staff were awesome. You do not get your room cleaned automatically you have to ask for it at least one day in advance,1
Motto is located in a convenient way| not the best area but pretty accessible. The room was small but functional. Comfortable bed and clean. We loved the rooftop bar.,1
Lovely staff at the check in desk and caf√©. The room was basic but met all of my needs and budget. I loved the large shampoo| conditioner| and body wash bottles in the shower. Quality products and I didn't have to throw away little bottles. Overall| this hotel is great for the cost.,1
very nice hotel| staff was amazing. the location is so nice and central. the gym facilities were awesome. the rooms are small though.,1
Very great place for sightseeing| lunch| dinner.  Just don't forget to order room make up if you need,1
Great value for money. Modern hotel across the street from Gallery Place Metro and a Walgreens close by| very convenient. Many homeless in the immediate area.,1
The employees were very friendly. The room was nice.,1
all the employees i interacted with from the front desk to housekeeping to a maintemce employee i chatted with on the elevator could not have been nicer| more helpful or more welcoming.,1
Very small rooms| but very clean and well planned (little shelves and storage areas. We got two rooms instead of sharing one. I really liked this hotel| Location is PERFECT and the price is fair. The staff was just outstanding. Metro station across the street. Walgreens next door. Rooftop bar| Resturant and lower level bar all attached. The only knock I would have is no fridge in the room. I will stay here again.,1
Service could not be more amazing. Rooms were small| but well designed and efficient. Everything felt new and clean. Rachel at the front desk was awesome.  Conveniently across the street from the Gallery Place/China Town metro. Two stops from Union Station| if you take the Amtrak in. A conveyor belt sushi place is across the street. Most of DC| now that the police have been defunded| is pretty sketchy these days| but this area especially so. You have to use your room key to even get into the lobby - but we appreciated this safety feature when we found we had to scoot back in because a ranting and shouting character was coming down the street. Again| this is pretty much what you're finding throughout the city and not just in this area| so not a mark against Motto. Crimson Whiskey Bar is in the basement| and we ate in rather than venture out at night. China Town of today is very different from a decade ago. Some good Chinese restaurants| but only found a single Chinese retail store where there used to be dozens - along with grocery stores| meat markets and Chinese medicinal stores. Very sad to see the evolution.  Don't stay here for a China Town experience| that no longer exists| however| it's proximity to other attractions is great. If you want to do the Smithsonian and other memorials| it's a good location.,1
Great service and customer care. Special thanks for Jetty,1
Great location| very clean| the gym had plenty of new| modern equipment. If you have a car| street parking is easy and at times free,1
I will be staying Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center anytime I go back to DC. The location was perfect| directly across from the Gallery Place metro station| and was walkable to numerous restaurants| shopping areas| and tourist attractions. The staff was friendly and accommodating my entire stay| and even were willing to hold my bag after checkout so that I didn't have to take it with me around the city until my evening flight. Additionally| the rooms were the perfect size for one person| as well as clean and comfortable. And| as an added perk I loved Motto shares a rooftop bar with the restaurant Crimson| which had incredible views of the city. I would highly recommend the Motto to anyone thinking of staying in DC!,1
Great concept! I love the compact space. The staff was very friendly. Would definitely recommend it! The only pain points were low water pressure| a bathroom vent fan that never stopped running| and the comically slow service at the rooftop bar. Other than that it was perfect!,1
Very clean| nice hotel room. Small because cheap. Right on the street in Chinatown| so it was kinda loud at night but I'm also from a city abs was so exhausted so I knocked out easy. Super close to the National Mall too (.7 mike walk) and the Walgreens on the corner is the best Walgreens I've ever been to. Wish parking was free but whatever| the lot down the block is cheap compared to other places. Reserve parking ahead of time if you want a deal.,1
Amazing team at the front desk. Excellent location. It is a pod hotel so the rooms are very very compact| but for a solo trip| it was perfect. NextTo China Town so great food options. Penthouse restaurant- good drinks and great burgers. Walgreens at the end of block so convenient for things you forget or snacks. Also close to METRO so easy to get to other shopping areas| etc. could t have picked a better place I will be back.,1
The staff was amazing and the view from our room was beautiful. The staff even sent me a card for graduating‚Äîthey were the best! Although it's a micro-stay hotel| there were tons of food options around. I loved it!,1
I loved my stay at the Motto by Hilton. For any young women who would like a clean and secure place to stay in the DC area| I would highly recommend the Motto. You need a key card to enter the hotel and the card will only allow you to go to your own floor. I felt super safe! The staff is very patient| helpful| and kind. The rooms are small (thus the lower price tag) but they are very clean and up to date. The fitness room is also very nice: Variety of cardio machines| cables|  couple benches| and dumbbells. If I come back| I would definitely stay again!,1
Very cozy place to stay the rooms were pretty small| but it was nice and cozy. The rooms were very clean and the bed was super comfy.  We got to try out the rooftop bar and it had a great view on the outdoor patio. This hotel was very convenient since it was 1 min away from the train station.,1
Sharon (front desk) went anime abs beyond. She sends a B'day card along with complementary breakfast to go. I mentioned to her that I was coming with my teenage daughter to celebrate my B'day. Sharon really did make us feel welcome!We did not get the chance to check out the rooftop restaurant| however the hostess was friendly and service oriented.The gal at the breakfast bar however needs to be retained or replace she was so short and unwelcoming the complete opposite from Sharon and the rest of the staff.,1
Nice room and location| not much room to walk around. Still a nice deal to be right in the middle of DC,1
New hotel (or renovated) in mint condition| really clean| stylish and beautiful.  Staff were superb -- check in was rapid| and the type of advice and service I received from your front desk was superb| from printing documents to getting suggestions on local food| to calling taxis.  Desk staff were extremely professional and helpful.  I will stay there again.,1
Cannot park in front of hotel,1
It was excellent location cleanliness,1
The rooftop view from the bar was great! The streetwas noisy at night,1
I didn't stay Because the front desk lady was nasty and wouldn't take my deposit because my card didn't have my name on it. It was a vacation card because I don't like using my bank card at hotels,0
This is a nice place definitely geared more towards younger people (I ain't young) but the staff was great.  It is very convenient.  If I need to do an quick overnight in DC|it would definitely be on my list.,1
I liked everything. The room was clean| comfortable. I liked the staff very much. They were were very nice| helped me,1
Smaller room than normal but since I was mostly out in the city it was fine.  About a 10 min walk to the national mall.  And I easily walked from Union station.Only other thing of note is there are some shady people nearby but they mostly don't bother you too much.  And its only around the nearby Metro station.,1
Extremely clean. Service is so good| just a little bit noise if your room is by the street.,1
Perfect room for one maybe two. Location excellent. Great use of limited space and efficiency is excellent. Bed was very comfortable.Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay here again.,1
Location was excellent. The room was clean and comfortable. The room had a white noise machine and came with ear plugs. Security was excellent.,1
Our stay was great!!  Friendly| courteous staff.  The takeout breakfast burritos were very good too.,1
Great location!It is close to most major tourist attractions|museums|and restaurants....The rooms are perfect size for one who wants a good rest after a full day.But it is not only the location that makes Motto Hilton a great choice in D.C|but also the cleanliness|the creati ity to create comfort found in the smallest of details.Oh|the fine toiletries for such budget conscientious traveler.The room reminded me of small|but creative comfort of Scandinavian hotel rooms..,1
This hotel is a hidden treasure. It's conveniently located| 3 minutes to metro station and within walking distance to great restaurants. Will definitely stay here again!,1
The hotel room was cozy and perfect for what we needed! The location was great - we walked most of the city and no matter what direction we took we were seeing a new area within 1.5 miles| if we didn't want to walk the train station was right across the street and was a stop with 3 lines to choose from. It was extremely clean and beyond all the staff was overly nice and made us feel welcomed every day! I would definitely stay here again when we visit DC.,1
Great staff. Clean. Good location.,1
The hotel is very nice and valuable for the price - located in the good spot. Front desk staff are extremely helpful. They are super friendly. We found some problem during check in but Cheladi (pardon me if I spell her name wrong) handled it pretty well and professionally. Overall| we are very happy with this stay.,1
Very clean| secure and friendly location. This was my second time at this location.,1
I liked that even though the room is noticeably smaller than usual rooms| it didn't feel like you weren't comfortable. Temperature controls were nice| tv was easy to work and stream. Wish there was some sort of mini fridge or cooler to chill drinks (water| juice| others) for later that night| or early morning.,1
"The hotel has added security to prevent unauthorized acess to the upper levels of the building.  In order to use the elevators| you will require your room key.  The hotel has no parking.  We parked in the Colonial Parking Garage across the street which ended up $54 for the night.  The hotel gave us a ""discount card"" which I already knew wasn't going to work since we had seen no one working at the garage.  Best advice is to call ahead and see if they can arrange the parking situation before arrival.",1
Great hotel| friendly staff| awesome location in the heart of Chinatown,1
The location is very convenient and the hotel is nice. There are lots of stores around.,1
The room was clean and the staff was vary professional,1
Staff was friendly. Overall stay was nice| but rooms are quite petite,1
Lovely staff and great location in chinatown. Walkable distance to everything,1
Excellent hotel| friendly staff| and great location. When I booked I didn't know Motto was a hotel with smaller rooms so I was a little surprised when I walked in but that was my fault not theirs. Despite smaller size room was very clean and nice.,1
I spent one night after my shift at the Hospital. Everything was awesome. I asked for a quiet room to have a good night of sleep and they offered me a perfect one! The staff is friendly and helpful. Everything was really clean. The location is amazing specially considering the price for the room. Room is very comfortable and exactly as described. It's a micro hotel| therefore it is expected that the rooms are very small. However they are very functional and very nice.,1
The hotel was great. Awesome location and even better staff. The bar/restaurant downstairs (Crimson) is a favorite in DC too bad it was closed due to COVID during my stay. John at the front desk was awesome. Would def recommend if you are looking for a quick stay. Rooms are smaller than usual but clean and efficient. Def a budget friendly quick stay hotel.,1
Hotel have a great location and staff members was very helpful,1
I love this hotel and used to stay here when it was POD.  My only complaints are that there should be a clearly communicated plan for regular trash pickup since room cleaning is by request only. The TVs glitch often. That's it. This hotel is stylish| comfortable and affordable.,1
Great service| everything was very clean and organized low prices and excellent service.,1
It was nice. Very small. But good for a two night stay. Wish they had a fridge in the room. But they offered ice if needed. Uses SpotHero to park nearby. Amazing location. Everything is walking distance.,1
Very easy to find and really close to the monuments. Rooms were clean and and had some cool features like controlling the temperature form the remote control.,1
Staff was very friendly place was clean and very well secured you need a key card to reach almost everything,1
Easy check in quiet part of town access to stores and restaurants,1
It is a very clean place and looks nice but being a Hilton at least they could give a complimentary cup of coffee but they didn't. There are plenty of restaurants to pick from  some are open for done in and the area is considered Chinatown and was safe that I thought,1
I didn't like the offsite paid parking...hotel is good...,1
Cons - The rooms are tiny! The usb charger did not work| as well as the outlet in the bathroom. It was also a bit noisy.Pros - it was very clean!,1
Great value| very clean| courteous staff and convenient location. I didn't like the fact that it doesn't offer parking.,1
Definitely a small room to stay in over night in city- super clean and comfy in a busy city area. Perfect for day trip to city or overnight stays,1
Really,1
Great location! walking distance to everything. Rooms are a little small and the shower is even smaller and has curtains instead of doors.,1
The property was very clean the staff is wonderful the rates are good convenience stores and Metro as I've been here before and this is the only place that I Stay,1
This is a beautiful hotel. The rooms are modern and the beds are very comfortable. The restaurant was not open due to COVID but looked really nice. It would be great if it was open as we had a hard time finding a breakfast place nearby.,1
Clean and friendly staff. Check in was easy. Also great location. Definitely will recommend this hotel. Keep in mind the hotel rooms are very small.,1
Perfect location and staff was exceptional. Rooftop bar was perfect.,1
Hotel is very clean and comfortable. Staff was very nice.,1
My daughter and I stayed here for a weekend. The space was small but perfect. It was very clean. The TV and lights were connected by a smart feature. For being a small space the room was very stylish. We would definitely stay there again.,1
Staff was super friendly and helpful. I also arrived early than normal check in and they were able to go ahead and get me a room. Room was immaculately clean and appreciated the precautions taken for COVID-19. Sadly did not get to check out the rooftop bar while I was in| but based on the line for it each night it must be pretty awesome! I would definitely consider staying at Motto again.,1
Very intimate and clean.  A no- nonsense stay when you just want to drop your bags and relax.,1
Everything was great!  Staff was helpful and everything was clean. Only complaint was the placement of the main light switch in Room 1018.,1
Everything was great and the front desk attendant was amazing! The only challenge was the tv in the room. It kept cutting off and on.,1
The room was nice and clean And smell good  my room had a nice view the room was kinda small,1
I stayed here during a brief solo trip. The experience was great. The room I stayed in was nice and clean with a great view of the city. I commend this hotel for doing a great job with Covid precautions. The only thing I would say as a warning is that the Hotel has a partnership with the parking deck across the street| so be sure to reserve your parking on the hotels website. It was definitely weird seeing how different DC is during this time| however my stay here made up for it.,1
They did not return my money,0
It was way too small. Good for college students and young people. Cannot fit two adults| no bathroom door and curtain for shower. No bueno. They also tried to charge me for one night after checking in and turning around and leaving,0
I've stayed here multiple times| including when it was owned and operated as POD. This by far is one of the best hotels for the price in the area. Rooms are on the smaller side| but that's just the type of hotel it is and they make good use of the space. Other than that it's always been clean and the location is right off the metro. Prices have gone up since POD turned into MOTTO| but it's still a great value and I'll likely be back.,1
Grew up in DC and stayed many places whenever I'm back in town for a night or 2. This one is far and above the best bang for your buck. Would definitely return and recommend!,1
It was nice. Staff were friendly and helpful for the most part,1
Lack of any business services is a real detriment. I couldn't print anything. This will be a factor when rebooking for business. Otherwise a good experience and a clean room. Small| but that was expected.,1
Great location and friendly staff. Room is smaller than typical hotel room but it has everything you need and the bed is comfortable. Very clean.,1
Perfect location fir visiting the African American History Museum. Able to walk to museum easily. Plenty of restaurants to choose from right around hotel. Since parking garage is about a block away|  recommend you pack lightly ir only bring necessities to hotel with you.,1
Hotel was very clean and very quiet the staff were very helpful and polite the rooms are a bit small but I guess that's why their called Pods (lol) overall I enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend this hotel,1
We loved everything about this experience. Whisky bar was really nice. Parking a little far but the walk was fine and allowed you to see more scenery.,1
I really enjoyed my stay. They provide earplugs and an evening sound machine... and boy| will you need it! I think if you are tired enough| you won't hear too much of the hustle and bustle but that Sunday evening I stayed over| it was a genuine street commotion. I say| hey| if you can't beat em'| join em'. It is a very vibrant area and perfectly centered in the middle of everything! I would stay EVERY SINGLE TIME I travel to downtown DC.,1
It was just what I was looking for--clean| no more than i needed at a good price.  I enjoyed the location in chinatown and the co-located bar and diner.,1
Location and staff were great. Walls are very thin. I could easily hear my neighbors having a conversation... and I could REALLY hear them when they were drunk and fighting.,1
You go to DC to explore| so you only need a hotel to sleep and shower and thats exactly what POD provides. The rooms are smaller than average but| like I mentioned| you won't be hanging out in your room anyways! My only concern was that the bathroom had a sliding door| which would start to open if no one was holding it. Because the door was sliding| it meant there was a gap between the door and the wall. Other than this| great hotel! It's close to so many nice restaurants and even has a rooftop bar. I will definitely be staying here again.,1
Great staff at this place! Parking is a bit inconvenient,1
Just stayed for one night but I had no issues or complaints. The burger I also had was amazing.,1
Great experience! Friendly staff| great restaurant area| comfortable and clean room| excellent location. Only slightly negative thing was a random tick sound that I'd hear (maybe pipes in walls?) but there are ear plugs in the room to help with noise so I just used those :)It's a perfect place if you want to stay somewhere nice but don't need all the fancy extras that expensive hotels charge you for.,1
Was given an ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù  room with a queen bed instead of a bunk. Was told there would be no charge. When I checked out I had a $30 upgrade fee per night and was told there is nothing that could be done.,0
Convenient hotel with nice bars and close to all the action in DC.,1
Customer service and room was straight forward and very pleasing. Hotel is located in a good area - we were able to walk everywhere and rent bikes/scooters if needed. The diner/bar attached was open to the public so its atmosphere felt more inviting than most exclusive hotel bars. In all| it was nice to come back to a clean| comfortable| modern room after exploring the town all day.,1
This is a very specific kind of hotel . Best for able bodied young adults single or couple only |short stay. Not for children |elderly|frail or disabled.. Fun public spaces.,1
It's in a great location and it's affordable. No one needs a big room when you're out and about in DC.,1
Parking issues not including and no info about parking hotel,1
Great location| price| and service.,1
I found all of the reception and food & beverage staff to be fantastically helpful and friendly. I would stay in this POD again and I would also seek out any other PODs in future.,1
Pod D.C. hotel highly recommended!,1
Everything was great. The rooms are too hot though.,1
Very helpful courteous staff. Very clean. Cube fridge would be nice,1
The hotel itself is really cool with 2 bars and a restaurant. The room I stayed in was very small but I am a small person so it wasn't that bad for me. Someone who is close to 6 feet would need a bigger room. You do have to pay for parking also. The employees were very friendly.,1
Very accommodating Coming back next month (January),1
"Given the Name of the hotel "" The Pod"" is exactly what it is..Not what i expected. Room was small andNo where to park| bed was hard bathroom extra small. Great for one person and  The roof top bar was nice",0
This was my second stay at POD DC and it is exactly as advertised. Not a ton of amenities on site and small space| but meticulously clean and ridiculously easy to check in and out of. This is my new favorite hotel for traveling to DC by myself because it is exactly enough space for one person for a night or two and the staff make the experience so smooth.,1
It was Great,1
Front desk wasn't to helpful did not refund my $50 deposit yet rooms are too small for Wheelchair accessibility and Bums everywhere,0
"Pod provides everything you need in a hotel| and lowers the price by opting out on the things that you don't. The rooms are smaller| the toiletries are dispensable| and there is generally less space| BUT| I found that I didn't miss the things I see in traditional hotels. The designers of the hotel were clever in their choice of how to make the room smaller| but not cramped. Additionally| Pod had the best customer service in recent memory. The staff was extremely helpful and kind| even calling the room after we checked in to make sure we settled in alright. Located in Chinatown with the a metro station in sight of the front door of the hotel| Pod close to anything in the DC area. The location  is also prime since Chinatown doesn't ""turn off"" around 6 pm as many parts of DC do; the nightlife and many restaurants around the hotel make for an excellent stay.I will definitely consider Pod again| especially for shorter stays. If you're curious| I would try it out to see if you like it!",1
A nice budget hotel where but the environment is noisy.,1
Overall great stay. Was only there one night hut enjoyed my time. The staff was professional and helpful. Great whiskey bar downstairs. Room is small but thats expected from a place called Pod. Recommend,1
great location... friendly staff  wonderful bar and diner,1
great if you only will sleep in the room; definitely NOT for family vacation,1
Location and cost were excellent. Hotel amenities were nice.,1
A nice clean property. Rooms are small as expected but efficent. They had all the amenities of any other hotel room and then some. The only negative  thing I would say is| I wouldnt recommend it to non couples as the lack of space course calls for a certain level of comfort. I also wouldn't recommend it to those who enjoy spending alot of time in their room.,1
Friendly staff| clean| great experience. The diner is delicious,1
Great location in Chinatown| close to restaurants and other amenities.,1
Clean room and modern design| but no City view out window,1
The rooms are very small| but they're well-organized with a place for almost everything. They clearly state this in their description of the place| so it shouldn't be a surprise. For single travelers who will spend most of the time elsewhere| the POD represents a relatively good deal. It's less expensive than most other hotels| and it's clean| modern| and friendly. Plus it's right across the street from the Gallery Place metro stop| so if you take Metro from the airport it's really convenient.,1
The room was extremely  small (I guess I didn't notice it was a microtel when booking) but the location was excellent. We had to have maintenance come to our room to find the light switch| that operates the light above the bed| he had to move a small dresser to get to it.,1
This was a quick trip to Washington. Liked the description of POD and the reviews were great| so I gave it a shot. Staff was amazing! While this was certainly the smallest hotel room I've ever stayed in| it was perfectly laid out with all spaces efficiently utilized. Impressive! I only wish the rate weren't so steep. (But| that's Washington DC for you),1
Served its purpose.  I was in dc for a conference ....,1
My experience was bad. Rooms are very small.  I booked one double bed but bed was so small. If your height is more than 5'8 your legs will be our of bed. Double bed is not suitable for 2 persons. Bed was so small that 2 persons can not sleep. Moreover there were many bedbugs. I woke up several time in the night due to itchy bedbug bites. Bathrooms are small with limited amenities. You will have to request for toothpaste and toothbrush. Usually hotels provide at least 2 water bottles but I had to request for water. I think hotel has internal temperate control. I could not change room's temperature. You can change temperature setting but nothing will happen. I was there for meetings so I was spending most of time out side but if you are planning for vacations I will not recommend this hotel.,0
Pod DC is really nice. It's very central to museums| restaurants| etc. The National Portrait Gallery/National American Art Gallery is literally down the street. The other museums and the National Mall are also walking distance. There is a Walgreens on the corner if you need anything. The pods are very much that| pods. The bed is great| very comfortable| but the room is definitely small. It might be best for a person traveling alone| at least the room I stayed in. There is a bar/cafe downstairs by the lobby and a whiskey bar underground. Drinks were good.,1
Great job all the way around. Would have been nice to have a small refrigerator in the room.,1
Awesome room| very clean. Staff extremely friendly and helpful,1
I like the location of the property and the layout. I was happy with the cleanliness of the room until I removed the sheets from the bed and found stains and hair under the sheets on the pad protecting the mattress.,1
The location of the hotel is perfect,1
Liked having access to the WSC gym across the street. Staff was super nice and great location.,1
Great facility close to restaurants. Service was exceptional. I've recommended it to my friends.,1
My mother and I stayed in the bunk beds. The room was noisy but they tried to help with a noise machine and ear plugs. Clean| convenient location. Would have appreciated a coffee maker or hot water maker.Good service. Sufficient for what we were looking for at a good price.,1
Great place to stay. Was a small space but if your only using the room to crash while you see the sights in DC then this hotel is great. Great location| good service| all hotel staff were friendly (some cafe and bar staff not so much) and house keeping didn't turn up one morning| but on the whole I enjoyed my stay| would stay here again and would recommend to others,1
Great stay!!  Good area.  Would definatley recommend!!,1
I enjoyed my stay. The hotel is new and in good condition| a green building. The staff was friendly and helpful. The roof bar was crowded with young locals| making it less than receptive for a solo business traveler| but it was Friday night.The rooms are VERY small. I would not have been pleased to have to be there as a couple. There was no place to leave the my luggage but in the middle of the floor next to the bed| a tripping hazard. There was no coffee offered in or with the room. The room was not sound-proof; noise from the hall and other room is an issue they acknowledged with a pair of earplugs on the night stand.I liked the location| right in the center of things| with cafes and stores nearby.  I felt safe| and security seemed good.,1
Convenient| welcoming| artsy eclectic.  Good food readily available with a great atmosphere! Enjoyed both the roof top lounge with great views and the crimson whiskey bar.,1
A nice little hotel in Chinatown. The sign for it is fairly high up so it's easy to miss if you're walking on the same side of the street as the hotel. The bunk beds in the room were a great use of space but still large enough to accommodate a normal sized adult. The noise from the construction work going on in or around the hotel wasn't ideal but I assume that's temporary. My only real complaint was the pillows which were thin and didn't provide enough neck support for a side sleeper like myself. Overall I would consider the POD for a future stay in DC.,1
Great staff.  Perfect location.         Room has everything,1
POD was a lovely place to stay. It' was easy| affordable and friendly!,1
Perfect for a short stay and single traveler. Service was outstanding and the restaurant/rooftop are great additions.,1
The concept is great| just what you need for a quick trip!,1
Room design was phenomenal. So pleasant and inviting even though the room was small. It didn't feel at all tight,1
Excellent| clean place for a short stay. So close to downtown and so many restaurants!,1
Perfect location to stay after a concert. Very conveniently located| there is a Walgreens and Starbucks less than a minute walk if you need to grab anything. She room is perfect size for solo travel| view from rooftop bar is nice too. Very affordable for it's location.,1
Great location| friendly service at the front desk. Just what I needed for a quick trip. Room is small| but very efficient use of space. I didn't feel like I was missing anything. Very clean rooms and public spaces.,1
great location!,1
This property was a great location to visit DC and the surrounding areas.  Great team and great hotel. Very customer service oriented!,1
Convenient to Metro Stations and near by restaurants.,1
Great modern hotel| nice location| clean. Would be better if there was closer parking but understandable in the city. Had a bad experience with one hotel employee (did not get her name) but everyone else was nice!,1
New| fresh rooms. Great location (across the street from the Metro). Only issue is the rooms are small (but great if you are on your own).,1
Over all it is worth to stay. However| surprisingly there was no microwave facility.Best regards,1
It's just what you need. Clean room and bath| excellent location| great price. Metro is adjacent to the front door. Restaurant next door has a coffee bar and roof top deck with views of the Washington Monument.,1
This is a nice| clean modern hotel in the ‚ÄúEuropean‚Äù vein (shower only| no mini fridge| just the basics). It is in an excellent location right across the street from the metro with some of the friendliest staff ever. I highly recommend it. The main downside is that it is so close to the arena that the cheering crowd and drum line was very loud...but| the room came with ear plugs and a white noise machine| so they're trying.,1
It's clean| small but functional. Great for a short stay,1
Great location and personable staff. Would definitely recommend!,1
The whisky bar was awesome| breakfast menu as well.The only thing I did not like is having a TV in the room not connected to any channel not even giving chance to link your Netflix at least,1
OMG! I love everything about my stay here. The front desk was amazing. The best customer service I experienced in a very long time. Thank you| Pod!,1
Room was nice| tiny... but that's expected for a POD hotel.Only,1
Great location and price.  Just enough room and features in the room.  Loved the options for blue tooth speakers and HDMI connection to TV.  Doug and others at front desk were wonderful.  On the downside| the USB ports didn't work in my room.  I'd also like to be able to get hot water to make tea.  I didn't seek out the water bottle filling stations to see if they had a hot water option| but that would be nice.,1
Nice place near all attractions| friendly staff. No area to unload so plan ahead.,1
Nice and superb hotel to stay |,1
Located right in China town! Always clean rooms and friendly staff. Couldn't recommend it more!,1
O loved it everything about it. Deffertly will be back,1
Amazing location w/ amazing staff. Very clean room w/ everything you'll need for a comfortable stay.,1
"The staff were friendly and accomodating. The atmosphere was warm and trendy. The room was modern and bright. The only ""catch"" is that the rooms are almost comically small| however if you're here just for a night after a concert at the capital one arena like we were (you can physically see it from the hotel) it was 100% perfect",1
Overall a very nice hotel. The room is the average size of a bedroom| very clean| the area in which it was located is nice| staff was very friendly and I'd recommend it.,1
Everything was exactly as expected. Bed was comfortable and the room was exactly what I needed for my stay. Would recommend staying here over a pricy hotel especially since odds are most of your time will be spent outside of it. Walked everywhere from here. Great stay!,1
It had all of the essentials| was conveniently located| and and the staff was very inviting and welcoming. Would definitely recommend.,1
Affordable| clean and convenient. Had problems with WiFi| the TV was glitchy| and the lights rather inconveniently switched off for some reason. Otherwise good.,1
Awesome place see you later this summer ! Great location great staff,1
Location is fine. It can be noisy outside| as there are many people wandering around.,1
This property doesn't have a lot| but that's the point. If you're travelling alone or with a partner then pod is perfect. Pod DC is situated in Chinatown| with easy access to the DC metro and nearby conference center. The rooms aren't spacious but the beds are comfortable. If you need a place to sleep| pod is for you.,1
"Super service and friendly staff.  Hotel is in good shape and in a fun area but it is loud b/c there is a lot going on here!  Decent bed and shower| just gotta know that Podlife means cramped spaces and no place to put stuff| so the ""comfort"" isn't always the highest.",1
Front desk staff was amazing & incredibly helpful.  Restaurant staff was quick & accurate.,1
The staff were outstanding The price for the room one would think the room would have been bigger and no microwave or small refrigerator in the room.   For the price one could get a much better room just around the corner,0
Nice place. Excelente personal. Good for couples andd and friends.,1
Great people on staff!  Liked the onsite restaurant.  Room was clean and modern.,1
What an amazing hotel! What an amazing staff! The hotel is literally in the middle of downtown DC so you're really close to all the museums| memorials| historic sites| as well as great restaurants and nightlife. Shouts to Doug and Destiny from the Pod. They were absolutely great when our group reservation hit a snag. They smoothed everything out which made for a stress free stay. I plan on staying here again. It'll probably be my ‚Äúgo to‚Äù from now on in DC.,1
The staff here are amazing and friendly. If they had a refrigerator/coffee maker in room| I would rate them higher. Location was ideal but my expenses added up because I had no way to keep any fresh snacks/make coffee in my room.,1
Food in the downstairs restaurant good| loved the jambalaya| and the upstairs roof bar was relaxing. My husband was amazed a the huge selection of whiskies downstairs but he is not a fan of American  whiskies so we did not stop. Overall highly recommended| just inside China town and so close to the numerous sites.,1
Friendly| efficient and fun.  Perfect central location and just the right vibe.  Just the right amenities to get the job done while staying cool.  The front desk staff and the host at restaurant were particularly helpful.,1
The staff was exceptionally friendly and went out of their way to make us comfortable. Despite the small size of the room| it was very functional and efficient and also modern.  Convenient to Metro and only a few short stops most attractions.  I would definitely stay at the POD again.,1
Very modern. The room is small but the lay out was perfect. I believe Queen beds is the biggest they offer. Visiting Washington DC | I didn't spend any long length of time in the room during the day as I was site seeing. The price was reasonable. The location was great for riding the Metro - right across the street. It is in Chinatown that was a bonus for eating some authentic food. The hotel was very clean and so was the city. The staff was great| friendly and accommodating. We were able to check in at 10 in the morning having taken an early Amtrak arrival from Virginia.  I would definitely stay at the Pod again during my visits to Washington DC as there is still so much to do and see!  All the main attractions are about 2 to 3 exits on the Metro.,1
Cool place to be on the middle of Chinatown. Everything was great| beds need a little work.,1
Roof top.bar  on site whiskey bar and restaurant close to the Capital arena,1
Loved our stay here! Staff was more than wonderful and extremely friendly. The location was great| easy enough to walk to and from food and attractions| and even EASIER to scoot/bike. The rooms lived up to their name as far as size| a little cramped for two| but considering we spent most of our time out and about it fit our needs perfectly! Not to mention| it was stunning. We enjoyed the rooftop bar attached and got EXCELLENT service from the bartender who ended up giving us tons of great local favorites to check out. By far the most noteable part of the trip was the ability to stow our suitcases after check out. Not many hotels would offer this and it gave us the opportunity to explore the city for a few extra hours before our evening flight! Couldn't reccomend it enough.,1
Loved this place!  Small| but you manage.  The place was clean| chic| and service was excellent.  Great price too.,1
Small room was perfect for just me. It was comfy| clean| bright| and convenient. Loved my Pod experience!,1
There are lots of good restaurants in this area.   The hotel is new and very clean and cared for.   The staff we interacted with was great!   The rooms are very small| with very little storage space.,1
We loved our stay at the POD! My friend and I were in town for a concert. The hotel is directly across from the Metro and right down the street from the Capital One Arena. The staff was extremely helpful and respectful| even refusing to share the elevator with us| even though we insisted| because it was our vacation and they felt we should be left alone. We ate and had drinks at all three restaurants/bars| with each being great in their own way. The room was exactly what we needed. Everything was exceptionally clean and well thought out| including the noise machine and earplugs (which we didn't need- it was super quiet). We absolutely loved it and can't wait to stay at the POD again!,1
Budget-friendly| prime location| excellent food and bar selection inside the hotel| hip/modern ambiance and clean!,1
This hotel was amazing.  Everyone was very kind| respectful| helpful and simply amazing.  Room is small but that was perfectly ok.  Employees| restaurants| experience in total was awesome.  If you go to Washington DC this hotel is great.  The area even though in China Town and far from perfect but still felt safe.,1
Rooms are small but we expected that. Was very well appointed and clean. Loved the whisky bar and rooftop. The staff was excellent. Great location. Will definitely be back.,1
The location is great rooms really small,1
The hotel itself was great. I did not enjoy the cold room kept at 21 degrees Celsius. I kept turning thermostat up| but it would go back to 21. Otherwise it was a lovely stay.,1
Great location. Great spot. Walking distance to many things.,1
While the room was very tiny (no room for the suitcase| it was VERY clean and modern. It's in a great area of town across the street from a subway stop. The front desk staff was very helpful and pleasant. They provide a noise maker and earplugs to cover the city noise.,1
I attended a conference at the Washington Convention Center only a three block walk from the DC Pod Hotel. The hotel is nice and very clean. The restaurant is great and serves breakfast all day. There is a Starbucks across the street and a Walgreen's at the corner. The hotel was perfect for me.,1
Clean. Easy. Awesome location. Great staff! Great food and drink.,1
Cool| modern hotel. Friendly staff. Great location| especially for the Convention Center and Chinatown area. Only downside is that the rooms are quite small. The queen bed took up most of the room| and getting from one side to the other meant hugging the wall. No closet and only one drawer for clothes. Fortunately| the suitcase fit under the bed because there would have been no other place to store it.,1
The hotel was conveniently across the street from the Metro| and one stop from the event I went to (Giant's Barbecue Battle at Archives/Navy stop) and staff was friendly. Its the room itself that I don't like| too small and tight. Very clean| though! It would be nice if their was a vending machine in the hallway. Or at least ice machine since Walgreen is at the corner.,1
Had a great stay.  Staff was great but the rooms were very small.,1
Very efficient| tiny rooms. I actually like it| as I feel very safe and cozy. Big dudes may feel claustrophobic. The neighborhood isn't the best| but it's not bad| either. Convenient for my work travel. Lots of restaurants. Walgreens & Starbucks just a few steps away.,1
Check in and out was very quick. The hotel was clean and safety was not a concern. The room was comfortable and I liked all the up to date advantages| such as connecting to the tv via BT and USB power outlets.It was a little noisy at night from the street below but otherwise very comfortable.,1
Property was great. Found the room to be very clean and it was actually more spacious than I expected. Lionel made sure my check in and stay were top notch. He truly went above and beyond|,1
I'm a frequent visitor to DC but this trip/booking was first time I really ever noticed that this hotel even existed. It's located directly across the street from a main Metro Station which is super convenient if you are coming by train at Union Station or via plane at Washington National. The area has lots of food options and drug stores/amenities and it's a quick walk from a lot of great sites. The staff is incredibly friendly and regardless of who was working the desk| they always greeted you with a huge smile. The hotel is pristine| super clean| quiet and the rooms are comfortable and modern. I'll definitely be coming back for my next trip.,1
small but clean and has all featuresgood location,1
I spent the day out of town for personal reasons. The room was well-kempt| and checking in was considerably prompt. The Metro station was right outside the hotel| so that was convenient. Also| the location of the hotel was convenient to the Union Station and other places I needed access to.,1
Great place! I took my boyfriend here as we stayed the night in DC for his birthday. The hotel staff was amazing and all of the staff was welcoming. The room was clean and just enough for the night!,1
Cool bar and restos. Staff was excellent and super friendly.,1
Everyone was very friendly. This was my first time staying at a hotel with the rooms being this small. But I was very comfortable,1
The staff are friendly and courteous. I will definitely consider the hotel again if my schedule| business or personal| will bring me to the Chinatown area.,1
The hotel is in a fantastic location and right across the street from the metro. It has a wonderful whisky bar and a rooftop bar (with a view) that you must check out. The room| however| is extremely small. It's so small that there isn't anywhere to comfortably put your suitcase and still have room to walk around. The rooms are really cute though| if you're ok with a dormitory/artsy room. So| overall| it was a really good stay. The location and the amenities are worth the trade-off if you can pack really lightly and if you're ok with a firm bed.,1
Great room| great price| great staff.,1
Great staff| very clean| nice facilities and great location.,1
Small room in a good location with a very very fraindly stuff. High value for money. Very nice design lobby and a roof top bar.,1
We had a great stay at the hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful with anything we needed. The location was great as we were able to walk to most places.,1
The location of the property was fantastic. Close to a lot of restuarants| the convention center and the metro.,1
The rooms are TINY| but well kept.  I was fine with it and the location| but my wife not so much.  The staff were some of the best I've met anywhere and I travel for a living.  The location was so good we never took the metro to the local attractions and splurged on Lyfts for the rest.  DCA is <15 min away by taxi and the mall is ~10 walking.  I'd definitely stay again| my wife may convince me otherwise.,1
The Good:Hotel was very clean and loved the modern ambiance. Most of the staff were friendly. Enjoyed the fitness room. Location was great| in the heart of Chinatown with lots of places to eat within walking distance. And right across the street from the Metro station. The hotel shares its property with a cafe| restaurant| and 3 very cool bars (whiskey bar is awesome!)The Bad:Rooms were tinier than tiny (POD)| but that's what we signed up for| right? Literally just enough space to walk around the bed. No place to put a large luggage bag so I laid it on the desk which was smaller than my bag. Water pressure in the showers could be better| and the liquid pumps they use for shower shampoo/conditioner/soup were very weak with just a drop coming out with each pump. No ice machines?!? If you want a bucket of ice| you have to go to the cafe in the lobby floor. Good luck with them having a bucket for you....they were out so I had to carry 3 plastic cups of ice back to my room. And the employees at the cafe don't work for the hotel so they act irritated that they have to do something free for you as a hotel guest. Lastly| most of the staff is friendly| with the exception of the older white guy working alone late/overnight....won't go into details. All in all a positive experience| but all the little things mentioned do add up. I was there during a busy DC week so this hotel had the best deal in my price range. Not sure if I'd stay here again if prices elsewhere were better.,1
It was just what I needed| a nights' sleep and shower.,1
I met my college aged daughter in DC for a few days during her spring break. We wanted some place modern and stylish and centrally located which wouldn't break the budget. POD checked all three boxes! We enjoyed walking everywhere after having great cappuccinos downstairs in the lobby cafe. The proximity to the Smithsonian Portrait Gallery was just a couple of blocks| and the surrounding Chinatown had great meal options. Would highly recommend if you like an efficient and stylish place to stay.,1
Great place if you're staying in DC for a quick trip! We had a full pod| and it was tight quarters but definitely do-able if you're not going to be in your room| much. There is no microwave or mini fridge in-room| which I didn't think to check before coming. So I couldn't save any leftovers from the delicious restaurants in Chinatown!,1
No room cleaning from I left at 9 am and returned at 3 pm,1
Location is excellent.  They gave me an upgrade to a large room| which was very nice.  Did not try restaurant/bar at ground level| or on roof.  What I didn't like:  motel-quality towels| poor lighting at the sink| and no soap/lotion.  shampoo/body wash/conditioner came out in small dollops and were attached to the wall.  I didn't find out until checkout that they would provide soap on request.  clock radio on table but radio non-functional| required to hook up phone (via Bluetooth).  Bed/pillows adequate.,1
Room just a little tight. Unaware of storage space for suitcases under bed. Let people know| it would free up space. Great location for walking and parking.,1
Love the pod. My friend and I stayed here for our short visit to Dc. It's in walking distance from most places like the museums and White House. Definitely a good place to book when there's only two or three of you!,1
Property was great| area not the greastest| Loads of homeless and scetchy people,1
It was perfect for our weekend trip. Close to METRO. Will definitely stay again.,1
The hotel was clean and modern. Had everything I needed!,1
The hotel location was a very short walk to the DC Convention Center; as well as Metro accessible. Hotel staff were welcoming| accommodating| and knowledgeable.,1
Very good location| chepest in the erea| very clean| staff is very nice!!!,1
I ended up with bunk beds and in the reservations I put 1 adult and ended up with bunk beds,0
Pods are just enough space and have great extras like white noise machines and high quality soap products. Rooftop bar has great views and Whiskey bar has live music and delicious cocktails. It's located just inside Chinatown and there are tons of great food options nearby. Would definitely book again!,1
The property was exactly as presented in the search for hotels in DC| clean| small| accommodating| well located| and no-frills.  Perfect for one or two people to stay in downtown DC.,1
Great location one block from Capital One Arena and a short walk to Fords Theater and the Welcome Centre. Many restaurants in the immediate area and overall very convenient location. Awesome Whiskey Bar and Roof top terrace. They do a great breakfast at a reasonable price. The rooms are somewhat small but super clean and very modern| quiet and I slept like a rock. Staff are super helpful.,1
POD is in a really convenient location close to the Chinatown metro. The rooms were pretty small given the price| but are clean and quiet,1
Was good place| clean| nice| a little be tight but comfortable,1
Everything was great| but I didn't like the pillows.,1
Very cute hotel! Great location. However the room was very small.,1
It was shaped as a pOD ! It was very different and cool,1
Everything was good definitely would come back. Thanks,1
It was close to many attractions I wanted to visit as well as to the convention center| where my conference was.I missed having a coffee maker,1
At first I was a little shocked at the size of the room| but quickly adapted. Pods has everything you need when you visit a busy city and you are around and about. The price I paid through Expedia was great| but other paid extremely alot for the space and facing a wall through you window.,1
Good location. Nice restaurant on property. Room as advertised.,1
Great location and perfect spot,1
Great location in the heart of DC with all the conveniences you need at an affordable price,1
Nearly everything was good. I found the room too cramped and lacking a bench or somewhere to place clothing. Air  conditioning was difficult to work.,1
Staffs were all really friendly| room was decent but too small and water pressure was very bad it took forever to take a shower.,1
Good bang for buck. Clean| friendly staff| good rooftop and restaurant,1
Stayed for a couples vacation in DC. The hotel was surrounded by great restaurants and a solid mix of transportation options. I only wish I reserved a queen instead a full. A singleton-sized room was definitely cramped...especially when it came down to bathroom time. An updated hotels.com room description and warning would be helpful.,1
The location was great.  Check in and check out were easy and the room was clean.  It was an easy| downhill walk to the National Mall.Not having closer parking was a bit of a hassle| and there was a lot of noise from the bar and restaurant until about 10:30 at night.,1
Great location. Staff allowed us to check in early. What a great surprise!,1
We loved this hotel. The staff was friendly| the location was perfect| and we had one of their larger rooms. Our friends had a small room with no room to move around. So if you stay here| ask for a large room.,1
Noisy due to air conditioning equipment on the rooftop of the adjacent building,1
Great location and friendly staff. Rooms are tiny| but quiet and comfortable and has everything you need.,1
A fabulously beautiful modern hotel with small compact rooms with a lovely shower room. It  is on the edge of Chinatown and opposite a metro. It was so convenient to everything around. Lovely rooftop bar and a downstairs coffee shop  Will certainly stay again.,1
Staffs are so friendly! I would choose this hotel again in the future.,1
I loved this property! However i do wish their parking accommodations were a little closer. The parking is $25 extra and it's 3 blocks away. Not fun when you have a lot of bags. BUT everything else was amazing. The rooms were good| it's in the middle of china town so it's a little smaller than a normal hotel but not too small it's big enough for what you need.,1
Amazing hotel in great location with great team and clean rooms,1
Good location. Helpful Staff. Was able to get an early check-in.,1
Great service. Freindly and helpful staff. Great location. Room very small. We knew that going in but it was a little smaller than we thought. Everything else was excellent.,1
Walking distance to convention center| restaurants| and metro,1
Well trained and super friendly Staff. Clean Room. Great Stay.‚Äù,1
Great value for the room and location. Expensive time of year to be in DC and this location was great!,1
When we checked in the hotel was out of the type of room we researched but upgraded us and gave us free breakfast tokens at no additional cost! The hotel was quiet and clean. We will be visiting again!,1
Location was excellent.  Very quiet. Staff was really nice,1
These rooms are far smaller than a regular hotel (super 8| Marriott) ‚Äî but  I don't plan to stay in my room a lot. It has everything you need Dash a bed| a bathroom| a TV| a mirror| a closet| a tiny desk. No extra chairs| no dresser| No fridge| no coffee maker. It's just a basic room| but it's spotless. The location is half a block from the metro. It's less expensive| and therefore it's a perfect option. Will stay again.,1
Great Hotel! They are small rooms but we were not in the room long and at a great price it made since to stay here. Close to about everything and across the street from the metro station. Great people who work the front desk and felt welcomed every time we entered the door.,1
It was very clean and the staff was amazing.  They used space in the rooms very efficiently.,1
Great stay| friendly staff who are constantly ensuring your stay is to your satisfaction. Love that there is a restaurant and bar in the hotel| which makes your stay that much more convenient/comfortable.,1
Overall| this hotel was great. It's in a great location (especially Capital One Arena) and the staff was very helpful. I don't think I would want to stay here longer a couple days| though| as the bed was not the most comfortable.,1
The property is what we would call a youth accommodations.  No coffee machine| not much closet space| hang stuff on hooks| not much table room to write one| However| manageable.,1
The hotel is small but adequate.  The staff is very courteous and upbeat.  It is a good bargain in DC.,1
POD| DC is close to great eating and shops. I knew space would be on the smaller side| but it was quite tight; not much place to put luggage/clothing. We were glad there's a lot to do right near the hotel because we wouldn't want to hang out in the room| given the small space. Fortunately| we only stayed one night| so we didn't have much with us. The service was fantastic; we had a warm| helpful welcome and were always greeted as we came and went. Easy check-in/check-out process.,1
This was the perfect place to stay for my last trip! Right across from metro for easy access to Union Station. Also a really easy walk to anywhere you'd like to go near the White House. National Portrait Gallery is close and there are fantastic restaurants nearby.,1
European style small room but adequate and clean. Reasonable price. Friendly staff,1
As advertised| the room at POD DC was small| but it was quite adequate for my solo long weekend trip.  I was attending a college basketball game at Capital One Arena| and it is only two blocks away.  It is also a short walk to the Gallery Place Metro Station| and there are many restaurants and bars nearby| but with the cold weather| I found the upscale Crimson Diner and interesting bars in the hotel to be fantastic.  In warmer weather| I am sure the rooftop bar is a great venue.  You are also right on top of Chinatown| and I enjoyed a front row view of a Chinese New Year's celebration. The staff was phenomenal from check-in (they let me check in 3 hours early) to check-out.,1
This is the first time I stayed at a POD style hotel. I like it everything you need in a very small package and a good price. The staff was excellent at the job and very professional and showed they care about your experience.,1
Nice location| close to mall and museums. Polite helpful staff and clean room. Excellent value!,1
This was the perfect place to stay overnight after taking in a caps game - short walk to capital one,1
‚ÄúThe staff at this location is top notch. They exude customer service. I felt incredibly comfortable and welcomed by them and this business should feel blessed to have such a perfect staff| from checkin to checkout.‚Äù,1
The hotel was very well located. The room| as the name of the hotel says is a ‚Äúpod‚Äù. Small but very functional| modern| clean.  Following the lines of a minmalist property| for me it was more than enough.,1
Good hotel in DC.  Not to fancy|  but if you want to be close to transit or are  attending a convention at the convention center 3 blocks away|  and are just sleeping|  it's perfect.  Clean.  Super nice staff. And a great value in a notoriously expensive town.  Breakfast was good (not free|  but free breakfast at hotels are usually crap)  There is a starbucks and a peets within a block|  and some good restaurants nearby.  And the lobby bar looked lively.  i wish I had time to check it out.,1
Small room but very clean and courteous staff.,1
one nite stay for had early flight the next morning. all was excellent. very well appointed. friendly service. would definitely stay again. the best yet for a decent hotel in the DC area. got a great rate to boot.,1
It was great but room could have been bigger.,1
Perfect little spot| very central to great food and transportation| for our weekend in DC. All the room we needed| and no extra| wasted space!,1
Good for business travel| clean| modern and comfortable.,1
We there for the Wizards/Warriors game!,1
minimalist and clean.  suggest provide hand/body lotion with toiletires,1
Very clean rooms and comfortably compact.  Check-in and check out couldn't have been quicker and simpler.,1
The POD is great! It's tiny but clean and modern. If you are traveling alone| it's a great place to stay. Perfect location too.,1
Great service staff. Clean rooms. Very small. Very functional. Perfect for simply getting a nigh's rest.,1
The POD was the best stay in a long time. Everything was exactly as I hoped after looking at the hotels.com website - the staff was very nice and offered to watch my stuff while I took care of a few quick things| The bed was very comfortable| TV was gigantic| internet solid and the area is outstanding! All the great coffee and shopping places right near by and a walgreens (I think) at the corner allowed me top pick up a few much needed things. This is my go-to place in DC area.,1
It was perfect for my needs. The staff was exceptional and the hotel was clean.,1
Modern property| efficient| didn't feel too cramped for one person for an extended trip (7 nights). Missed having a refrigerator but not a big deal. I agree with other reviewers that the street noise is loud| even with the window closed| my room on the 6th floor faced the street. Sirens| drunk people yelling| crazy people yelling| buses| trucks. I was on a conference call and people could hear the background noise. The yelling was worst from midnight to 2 am and was not fun. They provide an adjustable white noise machine in the room next to the bed but I found it to be too loud. Not a lot of large flat surfaces and the one table was tiny but did fit my laptop and power outlets were right there. There were other clever ways of providing flat space that surprisingly fit all my stuff: window sill| top of the heater| ledge under the TV| and a 3-tier small built-in shelf thing. Very good WiFi. Apart from the noise| excellent location centrally located in Chinatown with many Chinese and non-Chinese restaurant choices nearby| Walgreens and CVS. Across the street from the subway station| which is served by the red line that provides direct access to Union Station (good for coming from BWI) and the yellow line that goes direct to DCA airport. And it's one stop to the Convention Center which was a bonus.,1
The Pod is a nice| affordable place or a quick| in-and-out business trip. The neighborhood gets a bit funky during the day and crowded at night.  The rooms are very small but nice enough. The only complaint I have about the room is that the sliding bathroom door is about two feet from where you are sleeping.  The upstairs bar is very nice| as is the service there. The downstairs diner-like restaurant is great if you like diners| which I do.,1
Matty at front desk was superb............................................................................,1
The room is extremely small -- you can basically step out of the shower into your bed. That said| you just need a place to sleep| right?  The service is exceptional; staff is incredibly helpful and just plain nice.  My only complaint is that the hotel doesn't recycle -- I took my recycling out to the recycling bins on the street.,1
Great location across from Metro. Restaurant served a delicious and reasonably priced breakfast. The room was small but adequate for a short stay.,1
I loved it,1
Nice well located hotel. The staff| restaurants and bar are all great. The rooms are very compact but work well for a solo visit. It was all very comfortable and clean,1
Everything at the pod was great!,1
Overall the stay was really good. The location of the place made it so much easier to go siteseeing and do whatever you wanted to do. The room was the perfect size for a couple and it was enough space because it was small and intimate. The service was great and maybe a little too nice üòÇ. But over all I would recommend this place to any of my friends and family if they were to visit DC.,1
Clean and efficient room.  Good for a night of partying in DC.,1
front desk people very nice,1
I expected the room to be small but it was even smaller than expected making it a little difficult for my husband and I to maneuver (we are avg sized people). Otherwise it was clean| staff was very friendly and helpful| and the location was great. We walked to several establishments nearby and there was a nice rooftop bar at the hotel. We parked in the Penn Quarter garage which is just a few blocks away and paid the $25 hotel rate rather than the normal $50 rate for overnight. Overall| for the price and location| I'd definitely stay again.,1
We stayed here since we were watching a concert at the capital one arena. The location is perfect in Chinatown literally a block down from the capital one arena. It is in the middle of a number of great restaurants and points of interests. The value for what you get for your money staying at the pod is fantastic! The staff is friendly and the restaurants and bars in the hotel are easily accessible and pretty good. The only con is that the mattress was a little too firm for my liking and the feather pillows fell flat a lot while I slept. Other than that| everything about our stay was great! We'd stay here again! Perfect location and great staff!,1
All acceptable and cleanDorm style but value is fantasticWould stay here again,1
We received a call at 6am asking if we'd like to check out early. We were still asleep... key word| were!!  At 8:15 the cleaning staff started knocking on the door. I was getting out of the shower | so I did not answer the door. Several minutes later| they were back knocking loudly. I answered the door in my boxer shorts and the lady said ‚Äúoops| I'll come back!‚Äù  So much for a relaxing morning!,0
I had a very nice stay| very convenient.  I will definitely stay again.,1
Great location to NBA Game,1
"Great location| perfect for a place to sleep when you don't want to spend any time in your room. This is called a ""pod"" a reason. The rooms are small and very basic. But| if that's all you're looking for| it's a great option.",1
Room was smaller than it looked on Website - Great location to NBA Game,1
Our first experience at the Pod and it set the bar quite high for itself! We we're checked in by Daniel who was absolutely fantastic| very kind and we had a parking issue that he graciously helped out with. Rooms are small| clean and minimal but that's the point| get out and explore the area! Their roof top bar has great views and bartenders. Couldn't be any happier with our stay and very grateful to those we worked with there!,1
Stayed here for a night with my son to see a hockey game. The location is great - right across the street from the arena and the Metro stop. The rooms are small (as expected) but very functional. We had bunk beds which was fine for a night. The heating controls glowed brightly which I found annoying. Also| it was hard to get the temperature just right. Overall|  it was fine and I'd stay there again. In warmer weather it would be fun to play mini golf.,1
We really enjoyed our stay! It was just what we wanted! Hope to be back again soon!,1
Great location| like the food and bar on property. Small,1
I like the location and not paying for a lot of amenities I don't use. I get that it's minimal| and so be it. But it was a bit of a problem to have no ice machine anywhere. I don't think there should be one on every floor| but it would be nice to ice down a couple of beers. I needed an iron and it was brought to my room promptly. But there was a trash truck that arrived around 6 a.m. seemingly just outside my window to beep and beat on a dumpster for about an hour. Not their fault| and there were earplugs on the nightstand. But I had to wake up enough to find and open them| then worried about missing my alarm. Not sure what to do about that. Maybe more warning? I'll probably stay again when the price is right (it was this time| but hasn't always been).,1
If you need space for your massive luggage or want a bathtub for a soak at the end of the day| this is not for you. If you just want a nice place to sleep and be in the center of a fun part of the city| this is for you! Walking distance to the National Mall and White House.,1
I loved the location! Great restaurant around the hotel and very close to the monuments.,1
Great hotel in the center of DC| perfect for a business trip where you do not need much time in the room. My only complaint is the room I was in was the staging area for the housekeeping staff so that made it hard to enter and leave my room at time due to carts blocking. Otherwise| can't beat a hotel at that price and location and with amentities all around.,1
To be honest I booked the room on price but was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness| service and location of the hotel.  It was perfect.,1
Front desk and everyone was super friendly !! Everything is clean and i,1
Great stay. Very comfortable and clean. Friendly staff!,1
I rented two rooms at the POD hotel due to its proximity to the Capital One arena| and for the pretty cheap prices I'd gotten for it in comparison to other hotels nearby. Honestly| I wasn't expecting much but I was very pleased with the ease accessibility| quality of the rooms| sparkling cleanliness| and how very pleasant the staff were. Bonus: there's an awesome restaurant| coffee shop| and bar right in the lobby which feel far less generic and higher quality than most hotel offerings. If you're a light sleeper| bring earplugs - the sirens from the nearby fire station will wake you. I'll definitely be recommending this place to others| and will revisit it myself.,1
Clean| cozy room with lots of natural light. Great view of the streets. Large shower and vanity area. Very comfortable stay. Highly recommended!,1
Customer service was amazing. Extremely cute room with convenient location,1
No water to drink:-( no stores open to buy water late at night,1
All in all| a great stay for a short city break!,1
Good location with tons of nearby amenities and access to transit.,1
The Pod is in an excellent location - close to the metro| great food| the Portrait Gallery| and lots of other sites within walking distance. The rooms were new and clean but not super pleasant if you plan to spend any time in the room. Just too tiny to be relaxing and no space to spread out any work. We had two people in my room| would probably be easier for one person.,1
I would not stay here again.,0
Loved the room. Compact but well put together. Perfect for an overnight stay.,1
I was very pleased with the accommodations and appreciated the amenities. When I return to Washington DC I will definitely plan to book this hotel because it's very conveniently located| and within walking distance to many attractions and historical landmarks. The staff is also very friendly and accommodating. My room was pristine. I enjoyed my stay immensely.,1
I love that #podlife! I always stayed at the Pod39 in NYC| so I was delighted to find out there was a DC version opening and it did not disappoint! It checks all the boxes for easy| chic and affordable business travel. Rooms are clean| chic| thoughtfully appointed and efficient. Great rooftop bar for the fairer seasons| a good year-round whiskey bar basement with plenty of space| and wonderful all-day diner for breakfasts| dinners and more. I usually take my first and last meetings of the day in the coffee shop and diner or bar| and it's nice because I can drop off my work bag easily while I'm at it. Staff is friendly| service is quick| and rooms are always spotless.  Love the extra blanket- super soft blue velvety goodness| and the shampoo + conditioner results in a great hair day (or maybe it's that DC water| who knows ;) ). Overall I highly highly recommend the pod hotels| especially this nice new DC one| it's a great value and great location (across the street from Chinatown gate and metro). Close to convention center as well.,1
Very nice the staff was friendly the place was clean and comfortable a little smaller than expected but i loved it nonetheless would recommend it and return again,1
I had a short trip and this hotel was great overall. The location was in main Chinatown close to many landmarks and restaurants. It is very affordable.The interior| service| and comfort were above and beyond as well. I would definitely recommend this hotel.,1
Staff| facility & location were superb. Metro station directly across from the hotel. Only downfall was overnight noise (hotel had a white noise machine in room) along H Street.,1
"POD DC is in a terrific location--a two minute walk to the nearest Metro station| and just blocks from the National Portrait Gallery. It's got a great vibe--laid back and friendly. The Crimson Diner was awesome| and my room was clean and comfortable. Everything was laid out really well| making the most of a| ""city-sized|"" space| so I never felt cramped. Finally| a bed I can stash my suitcase under! My room overlooked the street| and I could definitely hear everything going on| but there was a white noise machine| and earplugs| (which I didn't bother with)| so sleeping was not an issue. This was  the perfect location to stay--not overrun with hotels. It had a real neighborhood atmostphere. Would definitely recommend a stay and will absolutely return!",1
Overall it was a good experience. The staff at the front desk was very friendly. The room was awesomely clean. Even though it is small but everything was neat| convenient and the design you can tell is considerate. My only problem was the noise from the neighborhoods during night. It is located in the center of the city. At night you can hear trucks driving by| night awes' screaming| and the hornning from vehicles. But they provided ear buds.,1
The location is the best. The rooms are small but more than adequate. Service is friendly and efficient. Street noise can be loud. The hotel is in a fairly new building and everything is modern and clean.,1
Rooms are small. Staff were great. Wonderful location,1
Clean| nice| but small rooms. A little noisy with occasional horn honks.,1
I have stayed in the POD before and would do so again. As long as you know its small no frills accomodation you are fine. I stay here for conventions at the conference center . No irons for business people and very small desk etc. Its a bedroom more than a hotel room.,1
The location is amazing| right across from the Chinatown metro. The room is small but clean. It's great for people who aren't staying in the room a lot.,1
Staff was so friendly and helpful.  Rooms were the perfect size with the right amenities and very clean.  It was an overall nice and affordable place to stay and in walking distance to everything.  Thanks for making our stay so enjoyable.,1
Great customer service. Room was awesome and nice location,1
Solid spot.  Small room but that was because that was all that was left.  Very good location.  Good bar below| solid food and rooftop bar as well.,1
Great location| service staff was super friendly. When in DC this is an excellent choice for staying.,1
Good hotel in the middle of many amenities in DC| great front desk service and friendly staff. The rooms are small and mostly ideal for single occupancy.,1
Clean| good price| good location.  Only complaint was that the key scan in the elevator wasn't working properly and I had to get someone to override it to get to my room twice.,1
Will for sure be back. Close to the Law school and great places tonest.,1
"It is a small ""pod|"" so just be aware! Hard to maneuver around the room| even with two people. But it had everything you would want in a hotel room: nice bathroom| comfy bed and TV. The place was clean and in a GREAT location.",1
We've stayed there twice already and recommended to friends. Give the Pod a try!,1
The room is small but it has great amenities and it is very clean.  It is a perfect location for touring DC.  The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful.  It was a great stay.,1
"GREAT location-- basically under the arch of Chinatown and across the street from the Chinatown Metro stop (direct yellow-line access to Reagan airport| but can also get on other lines there). Room was small (as was ""desk"") but functional and clean. Wifi worked. Staff were very friendly. Price was reasonable for how good a location this was.",1
This hotel is really fun and in a great location. But it really is small. I had a queen room and couldn't walk all around the bed without turning sideways.,1
I love this hotel! Great staff| location| restaurant/coffee bar| and the rooms are spotless - all for a great price. I will definitely come back when in Washington| DC.,1
Best location in an exciting neighborhood--Chinatown/Penn Quarter--convenient to shops| restaurants| the Mall| the Hill and Union Station (direct metro red line) and DCA ((direct metro blue and yellow lines)| plus multiple metro lines and easy Uber/Lyft pool access. Super pleasant and helpful staff and beautiful view from the rooftop terrace!,1
POD is one of the best places to stay when visiting Downtown DC. Steps away from the Chinatown Metro Station| and Cap One arena. From here you can walk or Uber anywhere. We trekked all the way to Adams Morgan on our last visit...of course we hit every dive bar on the way.  The rooms are small (European style)| with basic amenities and the bed is comfortable. Who stays in their room while in DC? The Rooftop bar is great when the temp is right| and the bar in the basement can;t be beat at night. Love this place| and will definitely stay again.,1
Pleasant minimalist hotel with lively bars and friendly service.,1
great location!| close to metro| National Portrait Gallery. Great restaurants nearby.,1
Absolutely great location in my opinion - we were there specifically for an event at Capitol One Arena (concert).  Very helpful staff| close to good restaurants (we did a lot of on-the-go eating| so can't confirm if there are any amazing sit-down eateries close by).  Not noisy| but we faced a wall a few feet away (we didn't mind - this was a great hotel room to just spend the night in| not necessarily lounge around and hang out for extended periods of time).  In our opinion it was very similar to many European hotels we have stayed in.,1
POD DC was a very good choice for my trip. The staff| room| etc was wonderful. You do need to be prepared for a much smaller than normal room size| but the room was clean and very up to date. The hotel is located in the heart of many popular venues in the northern side of the city near the convention center and the Verizon center to name a few...,1
Loved the 2 bars downstairs. Great place| in middle of China town.,1
Very convenient location to the Capital One Arena. Easy walking distance to everything we did in DC the day of and the next day. Just what we needed and at a practical price.,1
Very clean| perfect location| lots to do and eat in the immediate area. Walgreens next door!,1
Service in every aspects was wonderful. Will book again!,1
We stayed for a conference. Love the location and the service and the bar. Front desk was amazing,1
The front desk staff is wonderful. The hotel is clean and very nice. I LOVE staying at The Pod DC,1
Pretty good view from window| great bar. Nice staff,1
Very modern and just the space you need for an over night trip in DC. Didn't care to hear the trash truck in the alley several times during the night though.,1
The rooms are small| but for a solo traveller it was perfect. The Whiskey bar is great| the hotel is clean and the staff is courteous. It easily compares to some of the other boutique hotels in the area and the price can't be beat. The hotel deserves all the great reviews it has gotten.,1
For the price| I couldn't have found anything better. It was clean and simply appointed. The restaurant food was excellent and the service quick and friendly. The front desk staff were personable and not stuffy like most big hotel chains.,1
The room was good for what i needed it for: sleep. It was small and can't picture even two people in it for long.,1
It was great- small but just what I needed for one person.,1
Short weekend stay in the city - the hotel is located right across from the Chinatown metro stop which was convenient for me.  The rooms are small but if you're traveling solo they are plenty of space| i don't mind when I know the building has taken eco friendly initiatives.  It's in a part of town that can be noisy at night so if that bothers you| bring ear plugs but I slept soundly.,1
The name suggests a little capsule| but this is a great lifestyle type hotel| while a bit utilitarian (think furnishing by Ikea)| the room  was very clean| and pleasant. The staff was great| friendly and helpful.,1
Love the pod! Great value. Clean and well appointed.,1
Ideal location for short business stays,1
The place immaculate| convenient| affordable for the location and the staff is friendly and efficient. It's not the lap of luxury| nor does it pretend to be. So if you want clean| convenient and nice| this is the place for you.,1
Love the decor and cleanlibess. Staff was very friendly.,1
Would recommend vending machines and/or ice. We had to get up in the middle of the night for some water and there was nothing vailible so we went down the street,1
This place is amazing.  Perfect in every way.  I am so impressed with the brilliant use of space and the technology used.  Cleanest place I've ever stayed.,1
Our room was very compact| but it had everything we needed. It had all of the amenities we could want| was spotlessly clean and very quiet. The area is walkable| close to many bars and restaurants and most DC attractions. The size of the room was great for my husband and me| probably wouldn't have worked for traveling with friends| but I didn't see the size of the other rooms so they may be different.,1
The staff was friendly.  Room was modern and clean.,1
Great Chinatown location easily walkable to museums. Parking is an issue as the hotel does not offer any| so they should definitely offer some guidelines on where to park.,1
I've stayed in other POD hotels before| in NYC. The POD DC is definitely the most vibrant. It has a very young hip vibe (thanks in part to the whisky bar and diner on site); is super clean| compact| & attractively organized. The staff that I met were very friendly. It's also a great value for the money. However| if| like me| you're not in your twenties or hip-aspirant| you might miss the small comforts of a more stodgy hotel| like a quiet room| a soft bed| & body lotion rather than earplugs among the toiletries.,1
The stay was great.  Very affordable room with a cool hotel vibe and attached coffee bar and restaurant.  The staff was so friendly and helpful.,1
Wasn't sure what to expect as this was my first stay at a POD style room. It was tight but honestly had everything I needed. The only down side was the bed was not as comfortable as I would have liked.,1
This hotel is well located for getting around Washington. The front desk staff are really friendly and the service is full of nice touches| like lending guests umbrellas when it is raining. The rooms are very small| but have everything you need and it means the costs are reasonable for Washington,1
What a great concept! This hotel is so CLEAN! No icky carpets or old drapes and comforters- everything is modern and new| and no creepy| questionable fabrics in sight. The staff members are lovely| friendly| and helpful. And the location is amazing- I was able to walk to all my meetings and lots of tourist destinations. It's also right across the street from the metro| next to a huge| new drug-store| and surrounded by restaurants. Win-win-win! I'll definitely be back.,1
This hotel is almost new as it opened juat a year ago| it is well located in downtown DC although the area around it s a bit rough. Great roof top bar and wiskey bar! The only downside is that rooms are really really tiny. But overall it is a very good option in DC,1
Excellent option for a hotel within walking distance of the mall. Coffee shop and good restaurant on site. Chinatown is busy and rooms facing the street can be noisy as there is often music playing on the street.,1
I love this place. It was so cute and the room had everything I needed. It just goes to show that sometimes big rooms can be overrated. Only thing we were missing was an iron and the amazing people at the front desk brought that up for us FAST. Usually I have to wait so long for something that I eithered called multipled times or forgot I asked for it. Nice and imitate. Which is my thing. The location is the best too.,1
The rooms are small and might not work for everyone but they work well for me| and this is my go-to DC hotel. Centrally located in Downtown DC. Rooms are clean and the staff is friendly. They also have some great onsite dining and drinking options.,1
This hotel is in a good location as it is about a 10 minute walk to the National Mall| museums and Congress. The Chinatown Metro is just across the street.  The rooms are small| but clean and adequate and the bed was comfortable.  The 50 inch screen TV is nice.  Parking is nearby and it is in a safe neighborhood.  The Roof Top bar is a nice place to have a drink after long walks in DC.  They have a Coffee Bar and a Diner and a Whiskey Bar.  The coffee was decent enough.  The diner food is good| not great| but we did eat at the Crimson diner two times because it was extremely convenient.  Did not get a chance to try the Whiskey Bar| but a local on the street said it was good.  It would be nice if the rooms had microwaves and an iron| other than that no complaints.  The room does provide a hair dryer and a safe.,1
Great! Perfect place to stay and so close to the Convention Center as well as food and shopping! Room was just the perfect size for what we needed| staff was incredible from the moment we walked in| the hotel bar and food was also good! Highly recommend!,1
The hotel is close to a Metro station and lots of restaurants. Very walkable.,1
Space was clean and modern but much smaller than the pictures make it seem. Not an ideal space for a couple as the bathroom door didn't even shut fully. Iron/ironing board were available upon request.,1
Great location| clean room. I had a great night's sleep and loved being next to a metro station.,1
Super hotel| fantastic location| friendly staff ‚Äì what else could you ask for?,1
I love staying at Pod properties| and DC was a particularly high note!!! The team is so concerned about great client service| and they always go above and beyond. The location is perfect| and I throughly enjoyed the room.,1
Clean| comfortable| relatively quiet hotel in a great location. The staff was very nice and helpful. I didn't have a chance to try to the restaurant but it looked good. Lots of great places to eat and visit nearby.,1
Good location. Room is small with no coffee maker or fridge. There are water fountains located on several floors. The street below our window was busy and sirens were heard all night.,1
I had a great time because the POD has a great location. It was clean. Most of the staff was great.,1
This was a wonderful hotel with welcoming staff. The rooms were expectedly small| but very well thought out and had plenty of spac for everything! I'll be back with my family! Thanks...,1
It was a Great location and a great price.  It was comfortable and clean.,1
Excellent location and customer service!  With in walking distance to most memorials| restaurants| and entertainment.  The POD also has a great restaurant and whiskey bar.  We are planning another trip to DC in the future and we will defiantly stay at the POD again.,1
I liked the location and the price.  Nothing not to like.,1
I was not aware that this hotel does not have parking for their customers. If you have a vehicle you will have to pay 40 to 50 bucks to park overnight. And pay for street parking by the hour. Made it very difficult to find parking and walk to the hotel every night. The rooms and very small| we did not even have a closet.,0
I loved the location| only 6 stops from the airport by Metro| and  the Chinatown station is right across the street.  Lots of restaurants and around | a quick ride to the Mall by taxi or Uber - or a 20 minute walk.My room WAS small| no dresser or big chairs| but it fits one or 2 people easily. Very clean and quiet if you're on the back of the building.The staff is very friendly| every one from the front desk to the restaurant| all willing to give good tips about sightseeing and trasnportation. I will definitely stay here again.,1
Seamless check-in and check-out. Great room| great location and great price. Perfect for a couple who don't need all the space present in most hotel rooms.,1
I really enjoyed POD!I appreciated the minimalist simplicity of the room.  And visually stimulating design and decor of both the room and hotel itself.  The staff was very friendly and attentive| which I greatly appreciated as well. And...Location.  Location.  Location!!!The Hotel itself is located centrally to plenty of activities.  And although| Some other patrons May not appreciate it.  I enjoyed the hustle and bustle of Chinatown.,1
The staff were very helpful. We were checked in very quickly| the room was not very big but it was comfortable and very nice. The decor was warm and cozy. Will definitely visit again!,1
It's a great place to stay for a night. Friendly and helpful staff.,1
The rooms are small. This was ok for us we weren't in the room much. The staff was excellent. I would not recommend the restaurant as we did not like our food and it was very pricey.  The bar upstairs was younger crowd and pricey also with a deck with no view. Wasn't impressed. We loved Clyde's down the street. Hit happy HR and have 1/2 priced mussels. Emmm.  We stayed  twice at the pod. We like the hotel and the location.,1
Quick painless comfortable,1
Great location. No coffee maker.,1
