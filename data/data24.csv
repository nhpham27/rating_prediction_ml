Beds are small| firm and uncomfortable. Universal studios views are great. Shuttle service to park and city walk is nice feature. If you like firm mattress then this place is ok.,Aug 19| 2021,3,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
The property was clean but I didn’t like that my room was not cleaned none of the day I stood there,Aug 19| 2021,2,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

No transportation options to airports.Very limited dining options.No housekeeping.Room service was very overpriced and subpar quality food.,Aug 18| 2021,2,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

It was just a fantastic place all of the staff was just so nice and professional,Aug 18| 2021,5,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
The place is clean and the area is nice and really close to Universal Studios.,Aug 18| 2021,5,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
It is a beautiful hotel. Housekeeping is only every 4 days ( due to Covid) so unless you go somewhere to purchase cleaning supplies your sink & shower is dirty. We were there 5 days so our room got cleaned once. The housekeeper did an amazing job. There is nowhere to due your laundry. I was told to go to a laundromat. I didn’t have a car so that would’ve been pricey. No hot chocolate or coffee in the lobby. All the employees were extra nice but there were definitely disappointments.,Aug 17| 2021,3,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

I definitely expected more for what we paid for. The room smelt horrible| a mix of smoke and old carpet. Their Solution was to have someone spray Lysol.. that lasted 5 minutes.  The bed and sofa bed creaked| only one towel| spider webs everywhere. Definitely won’t be staying here again. Sheraton next door is so much better,Aug 16| 2021,2,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

For a Hilton group and at not so inexpensive rate our experience was very subpar. The check-in took a long time just to drag all our luggage and family of four to the 18th floor just to find out that the hotel room was either still occupied or hasn’t been cleaned - dirty towels everywhere| trash| toothbrushes…bleh. Back to lobby for re-check-in and got a new room on 11th floor that definitely didn’t provide the promised view of the Universal Studios that we paid extra for. We were given complimentary full breakfast for the next day as an apology| which was appreciated but still didn’t make us love this place at all. On top of it| we were given the wrong password for the internet so gave up connecting after an hour thinking it must be our device. Nope - wrong info from the hotel service. I lost whole evening of work that I needed to do. Parking wasn’t included and it’s ridiculous at $30 a night. Breakfast wasn’t included which was disappointing as well. There was also some dance competition during our stay so the hotel was crowded with teenage girls and getting an elevator definitely took some patience. Hotel rooms are smallish| starting to het outdated and definitely could used some upgrades. Also| we reserved the room for 4 people| and it would be great to have 4 towels and adequate  amount of toiletries in the bath. I had to call the room service and the missing items were delivered 45 mins later.Our experience wasn’t great and definitely won’t be returning!,Aug 6| 2021,2,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
The shower area drain was blocked and had to wait for 5 hours for someone  to clean. The nathroom floor was wer with water b cause of overflow and the cleaning crew came next day to dru itnup. Though they offered free breakfast| did not use it since it doesn’t make up for kids waiting for soak in water after 100  temperature all day,Aug 6| 2021,2,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
Chaos at its finest. Hotel is nice and clean but staff needs to be managed better. Very unorganized and nobody knows what they’re doing. Was promised free valet parking because of the horrible check-in process then still got charged. Restaurant pool bar was supposed to be open until 6pm we went down at 5:30pm and staff was already closing up and would serve us. Called customer service and was told we would get a call back.. never happened. Management needs an update.,Aug 6| 2021,2,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

Super close to Universal Studios| great onsite eateries| pool area| staff were amazing. However for a family friendly hotel| the in-room fridge was small| no freezer| no microwave| only one towel hook in the bathroom| and no onsite laundry. The garbage cans held one soda can each. Breakfast was $28/person....cheap wine at the pool was $15. It seemed a little steep.,Aug 5| 2021,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

Short walk to Universal. Closer walk to Universal than the Sheraton (I’ve stayed at both). The room was very clean and spacious. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it for those wanting to stay as close to Universal as possible.,Jul 30| 2021,5,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
Everything was conveniently located. There was even a filter water station in the lobby| which was such a fantastic amenity!!!! Every staff member we encountered was very friendly and helpful.

Room was beautiful.But shampoo was not full in the bottle and hair dryer was broken.And the most awful thing was breakfast！！ It was $30 !!Not fresh juce|Not many kind of fruits|Not many kind of breads.They have pack juce like school cafeteria.And apple and Orange and banana.Only watermelon was cut.They have a muffin and 2 kind of bread.I love Hilton.But this Hilton makes me disappointed.,Jul 29| 2021,2,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
Started off not so good at check-in-we were early| but was told they may not have the room with view I booked even after check-in time-had a Seinfeld moment-"you can take the reservation| but you can't keep the reservation." Our desired room was available by check-in & I was told they "had to do some shuffling." Again| Seinfeld moment-I booked this specific type of room a while ago. Also| we were staying for 3 nights| but they had  2 reservations for us-had to do 2 security deposits. We were told no maid service| but our room was made up while we were at the park the second day - maybe because of the 2 reservations? After all that| the room was great! Incredible view of the park and mountains! Clean room & comfy beds. Plenty of space| not crowded. The pool area was nice. Restaurant very expensive-$15 oatmeal| $21 avocado toast| etc. They've got you if you get up early| because the park opens at 9 and Citywalk at 11| so you have no options. That said| the Coffee Corner has breakfast paninis for $10 and muffins for $4. Short walk to the park| but they also have a shuttle to the park every 15 minutes. Upon arrival| we were able to store our luggage. Called down for extra coffee pods & tea| came almost immediately. Overall great| would stay there again when visiting Universal!,Jul 29| 2021,5,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

This is hotel is clean and spacious and close to Universal Studios (a 5-10 minute walk). I enjoyed the coffee corner in the mornings and my daily Peet's coffee. I was disappointed the pool was so much smaller than I had anticipated which meant it was extremely crowded. When my family stayed at this hotel| an indoor mask mandate in LA County had been revived due to high covid cases. Staff at this hotel did not enforce the county mandate at all. Most people were without masks walking around the lobby area and in elevators. You might want to avoid this hotel if you're concerned about covid or if it's important to you that the hotel you stay at follows local masking guidelines. Perhaps as time goes on| this will change. I really do feel for staff in the service industry who have been battling with mask resistant customers for the last year and a half.,Jul 24| 2021,3,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

My cousin has a timeshare with the Hilton and I have seen the pool area.  It was beautiful| tropical| and offers a food and beverage service.  I booked two rooms at this hotel rather than booking at my “usual” hotel while I was on vacation with my sister| daughter| and nephew.  We were greeted at the door| the staff is extremely welcoming and friendly and the hotel lobby is beautiful.   I usually travel alone with my daughter so security is a huge plus.  Unfortunately| I saw no security on-site| or at least I didn't see any.  The rooms are a descent size| clean| but the beds are very uncomfortable. In the pool area| as tropical as it looks we saw a couple of RATS| not mice| but RATS.  They appeared to be struggling with their breathing so perhaps they were dying.  The cost of the room is on the higher end so we didn't expect so much riff-raff.,Jul 22| 2021,3,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

The pool gate closes too fast and took the skin off my heal| which isn’t ideal for walking around the park all day. The breakfast buffet was bland and appeared to be saved from last month. Shower didn’t drain| so back to back showers threatened to flood bathroom.,Jul 18| 2021,2,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
Employees were very friendly|but I have an issue with the cleanliness of the room. I like to check the whole room whenever I check into a hotel. Right away we see a spot of the floor that’s orange and boogers wiped on things in different areas of the room. Nice hotel and very convenient when visiting universal studios|but the room cleanliness should be a little better,Jul 17| 2021,3,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

This was the perfect place to stay for our trip to Universal Studios.  Clean| beautiful hotel with a wonderful staff!  Everyone was so courteous and helpful.

We will definitely be back!,Jul 16| 2021,5,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
Our first room smelled bad of smoke. We had to move rooms. The carpet in the lobby was tattered on some areas.  The proximity to the park was good.,Jul 16| 2021,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
pros: room is cleancons: parking fee is high| $35/night,Jul 16| 2021,5,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
The hotel is within walking distance to Universal Studios. The shuttle is nice if you just want to use it to walk around City Walk. The room was nice and spacious. Parking is expensive and there isn't any resturants or shopping close by to walk to. The room wasn't ready as expected and the restaurant is expensive although we didn't dine in either night. Pete's Coffee is expesnive too. A great hotel if you're going to Universal Studios.,Jul 15| 2021,5,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

What I didn’t like was left over food/crumbs scattered throughout the carpet in our room and the feeling of cleanliness was not present upon walking into our room.

Will definitely becoming back ✌!!,Jul 6| 2021,5,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
Our stay overall was a good one. We had a great view of the theme park| which was perfect for the fireworks display. However| the water in the bathroom was a problem for us. The water keeps turning off and most of the time the flow in both shower and sink was very little. It was a challenge for a family of four to bathe. Doesn’t matter what time of the day or night. The hotel should check the water pressure for the higher floors| especially during peak days.,Jul 6| 2021,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

The hotel is super close to Universal Studios.  They have a free shuttle but unless you have a wheelchair/stroller| etc it is just as easy to walk.  The service at the bar the first night was pretty slow.

The hotel was very nice and very clean.,Jun 19| 2021,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

Our stay was great.  The rooms were clean upon arrival and I witnessed staff sanitizing frequently touched surfaces often which was great.  My only complaint would be that the showers/plumbing could use a little updating.   The water pressure was low and the shower drained slowly.,Jun 15| 2021,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
We chose this hotel for walking distance to Universal Studios. Check-in was a bit slow| but our bell hop was awesome! He kept me & my children company while we waited for my husband to park the car & find his way back up to the lobby. He was very knowledgable about the property & Universal itself. Upon entering our room| there was a strong cigarette odor| which was most displeasing. When we commented on it| we were assured the property was smoke free (now). Overall| we enjoyed what this Hilton had to offer & would most likely stay again.,Jun 15| 2021,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

We discovered bed bugs in our suite during our stay. We privately and immediately brought it to the attention of the hotel who largely disregarded it and said they would let housekeeping know. Bed bugs| unlike other bugs| are considered a public health hazard by the CDC. A report of bed bugs requires pest control inspection and mitigation. Merely vacuuming will not solve the problem| which spreads to other rooms quickly and can follow guests home with an infestation in their luggage or cloth items. Bed bugs habitually leave a row of bite marks on their victims| and we gave the hotel picture evidence of our multiple bites. After the way they handled our report - which we made for their benefit and the safety of their future guests - we will never stay at a Hilton again.,Jun 14| 2021,2,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

We stayed here because we were going to Universal Studios and wanted something that was walking distance from the park. The location was great| but the stay itself was not so great. The first night| we were woken up by our next door neighbors blasting music and smoking weed ( we could smell it in our room). The next morning| they were smoking again and our other neighbors were blasting music (around 7:00 AM). The front desk was nice and gave us some upgraded breakfast vouchers| but they still required us to pay a difference. We were so excited to have an "executive" level room| but it really just left us disappointed.,Jun 8| 2021,3,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

The property is beautiful. They have a koy fish pond and beautiful flowers all around. The lobby was spacious and had plenty of seating. I was a little bummed that they didn't have the airport shuttle available when i visited but they did have a one way shuttle to Universal Studios theme park. It was a short walk back but it could be tiring after a long day at an amusement park. The rooms were fully stocked and clean upon arrival. Bedding and pillows were comfortable. No house keeping service was available but they did bring fresh towels when i called down. The entire staff was wonderful and friendly. Room service food and the prime rib and lobster buffet was great! Pool was clean and towels were provided at the pool. The lyft from LAX was about $75 one way. Store in the lobby was very overpriced so beware. I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Universal.

Valet service was quick & check in was easy considering there was a lot if hussel and bussle because of a private event and grad night. That said we actually had noisey “ big kids” next door till almost 3am. Not happy. Our room was very clean & the bed was super comfy. It was supposed to come with complimentry bathrobe & slippers but i found none so that was a bit annoying. Check out is always easy. Complimentry breakfast was pre-bagged so it literally was grab n go.

The room is very quiet and bed is very comfortable. Parking is conveniently located below the hotel lobby| and I feel safe to put some valuables inside the car. It also has free charging ports for electric cars. But the bathroom is kind of old| it's a cheap shower tub with no hand shower for kids. The room also isn't cleaned well before we get in. We can still see little leftovers from previous guests.,May 5| 2021,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
Unprofessional and rude staff member| I didn’t fully catch her name but I think it was Tori (Caucasian female). Basically from the moment I checked in with her she was straight up bullying me| maybe because I was Asian? I did a virtual check in and the app told me to go see the front desk. When I approached her to check in she was very very rude and said I was a liar and that I never did a virtual check in and she told me I should of read the fine print. Like why would I read the fine print and why would I lie to you? I am just following the instructions of what the hilton honors app told me to do and I just want to go to my room and rest after a long drive. Then when I gave her my driver license she made fun of my looks and told me what happen to me. Even her co worker (Latina| female) was In shocked and told her why are you bullying him. I use to be fat and my driver license showed my picture before I lost weight. It really hurt me but I brushed it off because I was tired and did not want to create a scene. I was silent after that and got my keys and left to my room. For the price I paid| I felt like I was treated like a third class citizen and it felt like it was a nuisance for her to check me in.UPDATE: so Tori just emailed me and she is the front desk supervisor...basically telling me an “executive team” is reviewing my response. A very generic response..no wonder why she can get away with her unprofessional and rude behavior. She’s the manager...nothing will happen,May 4| 2021,1,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

Very very disappointed stay! First of all girl at front desk friendly but don’t know much about her job| Dhe issue is key for the Room but then she could not activate the key so she offer me that doorman can help us get in the room and later they can issue the key. Then even though we book hotel WITH breakfast INCLUDED she “forgot” to gave us voucher for it. Oh and by the way that breakfast included package include one cup of coffee and one pastry for which I paid $90 extra which they did not mention.  Excuse for that was given: COVID like always for every thing.,Apr 4| 2021,2,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

I am an essential worker and find myself still traveling a little bit for work during the pandemic. Different hotels seem to approach the restrictions and decreased customer flow differently. The Hilton at Universal like many (but not all) hotels have decided they do not need to provide much or work hard to win customers during this time. “No we don’t do that right now|” and “you have to...” are common themes. They are constrained and we get it| but they are also just providing the minimum and making no effort to earn our business and continued patronage.

It would’ve been nice if I had had a complete update on what was available and what wasn’t… There was no water in the room… No room service… No valet… So I had to kind of take care of everything myself.

Werent aloud to check in for a ridiculous reason. Given a check list of things in order to check in| buy the time i completed the llist the shift had changed. It was 2am and the new shift did not allow us to check in with the previous shifts to do list completed. Refused to refund. Made me feel like a second class citizen and huniliated me in front of other guests. We had to sleep in the car because it was in the middle of the night and there were no rooms anywhere.

Out of all hotel during the trip| this is the worst. The customer is bad| the manager is looking at me like I don’t welcome here. The stuff just great without putting effort on greeting.

Great overall! The gift shop was closed the day we left| when it wasn't supposed to be and the front desk wasn't sure why. My husband was bummed out because he planned on buying a certain hat from there before we left.,Nov 16| 2020,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
City view is the best,Nov 10| 2020,5,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
It would’ve been nice if I had had a complete update on what was available and what wasn’t… There was no water in the room… No room service… No valet… So I had to kind of take care of everything myself. I should’ve had a heads up… Or there should’ve been a major discount,Oct 30| 2020,1,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
I absolutely love staying here| very elegant. I’m fortunate for the price of the room which is why I decided to stay here.

Werent aloud to check in for a ridiculous reason. Given a check list of things in order to check in| buy the time i completed the llist the shift had changed. It was 2am and the new shift did not allow us to check in with the previous shifts to do list completed. Refused to refund. Made me feel like a second class citizen and huniliated me in front of other guests. We had to sleep in the car because it was in the middle of the night and there were no rooms anywhere.

Im very disappointed with this overall stay. I understand there will be changes during Covid-19. With all this into consideration| I was ok with new guidelines. However| the stay was NOT at all what was described. First of all| the room I booked was supposed to have a city view| and a bathtub; in fact| I got niether of these things. Secondly| the perk the hotel offered was 24hr room service. PERFECT! I even called the hotel the night before and she Confirmed| 24hr room service. Perfect! Come to find out| when we get there| they say room service is only open from 8am-10pm. Ok| thats fine. We called for room service at 9pm| it rang| and rang| and rang| nobody answered! We ended up ordering from outside. We wanted to get breakfast the next morning| at about 9am. Same thing| it rang| and rang| and rang. I'm just saying| if you're going to advertise something| please make it TRUE! Also| parking overnight is an additional price| Wi-Fi is an additional price| they wouldn't even loan us an HDMI cable.,Jul 21| 2020,3,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

Overall the hotel was great with lovely views. The staff was super friendly as well. There were only a few minor things that were odd to me: 1. The trashcans didn't have bags in them. 2. There was no exhaust fan in the bathroom. 3. The only mirrors are inside the bathroom| which makes it a little difficult to get ready when you're traveling as a family. 4. My family wasn't impressed with the beds. I didn't mind them at all. Other than that| it was great. We took the shuttle at every opportunity for City Walk and Universal Studios. The shuttles conveniently run every 15-20 mins and are at no extra charge. We did find the restaurant to be pricey| but I guess I have to remind myself that no one plans a trip to Universal Studios to save money.,Mar 4| 2020,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

Staff was friendly and very helpful.  The only thing that was confusing was the breakfast setup.  The hotel offers 3 versions  of breakfast continental| universal| and executive.  The food items are all labeled universal or executive but nothing says continental if you only ordered the continental breakfast you have to ask the wait staff which items are included.  Besides this little inconvenience everything else at the hotel was great.,Mar 2| 2020,5,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

Expensive but worth it for the location. The staff are also FIRST CLASS !  Reception staff could not be more helpful. Breakfast was very good. Lovely Restaurant Manager who didn’t charge for my son as he ate like a bird. Best waiters in LA couldn’t get better service even in the Savoy London.

The Hilton Universal City is the closest hotel to Universal Studios and so is a popular choice for many visiting families. After a three night stay here are my comments:1. The front desk staff is fabulous. I was not charged for early check-in and was given a password for wi-fi. I was greeted with a smile and given tips to enhance my stay.2. There is an issue with the water. At one point| no water came out of the faucets for several minutes. For the rest of the stay| the water was lukewarm and smelled like sulfur. No hot showers at this hotel. 3. We had a corner room. It was small| but had a fantastic view of the park.4. The sofa bed was terrible. The mattress was very thin and groaned and creaked each time my child moved during the night.5. There is a shuttle that runs between the Hilton| Sheraton and the park. It drops off at Universal City Walk behind Johnny Rockets. We generally waited 10 to 15 minutes for it to arrive.6. The hotel will allow Uber/Lyft drivers to pick up and drop off at the main entrance.,Feb 18| 2020,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

The service was fantastic during our stay. The remote control was not working when we first arrived so I called down. A service man was knocking on our door to replace the batteries within 5 minutes. We ordered room service| an omelette and hash browns. The hash browns were perfectly crispy and the hot food was hot.  he one major issue we had was with a dessert we ordered. My son has a severe peanut allergy so we ordered him the mango bomb as it did not list any peanuts. When it arrived the bomb had a nut crust. The nut crust has pistachios and peanuts. A potentially deadly situation for my son. We called and the chef said that he has asked for the menu to include the peanut warning but it hasn't been changed in weeks! They took the bomb off the menu but you need to disclose all allergy information.Having the chef ask and get denied that disclaimer shows contempt to your staff. That is highly irresponsible for your organization and I am very disappointed in the way you treat allergies and your staffs opinions on disclosure of allergens. Other than that major issue| the rest of the stay was great! Very attentive staff!

I overall our stay was nice. In the bathroom a long the edge where the wall paper is| there is a lot of sticky dirt & dust.  Has not been clean since who knows when. They desperately need to install bathroom fans.   The bed was comfortable | our grandson slept on a pull out couch bed| that was far from comfort. They did not sleep well.

For the amount of money they charge at this hotel| I expected excellent service and hot showers| as it is December and freaking cold outside. But I was sorely disappointed. We were put on the 2nd floor| which is one floor under the lobby| we had a view of concrete/backside of hotel and there was absolutely NO hot water. I complained to the front desk to fix this issue & they did absolutely nothing because the next day| there was still no hot water| not even warm. It was freezing cold| even after leaving the shower on for more than 30 minutes. After a long day at the park and with a child in tow| I find it unacceptable to not even be able to take a hot shower. I do not recommend this hotel. Not worth it.,Dec 30| 2019,1,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

Great hotel very conveniently located. You can just walk to Universal Studios or you can catch the shuttle. The pool and hot tub were a great way to end the long days at the park. We ordered room service and ate at the restaurant and both were amazing. Our family had an amazing stay in this location and I will totally stay here again.,Dec 30| 2019,5,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

I overall our stay was nice. In the bathroom a long the edge where the wall paper is| there is a lot of sticky dirt & dust.  Has not been clean since who knows when. They desperately need to install bathroom fans.   The bed was comfortable | our grandson slept on a pull out couch bed| that was far from comfort. They did not sleep well. I do not recommend it.,Dec 30| 2019,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

We stayed 2 nights at this hotel due to its close proximity to the Universal Studios Theme Park and a Metro Station.The staff were cheerful| friendly and happy to help with travel advice.  We are from England and had not used the Metro system before.  They explained how it work and ticketing etc.  It was easy| cheap and convenient to use!  We used it to visit the Hollywood Walk of Fame.The hotel and our room were clean and modern.  It had all that we needed for our stay.  Breakfast was not cheap but it was plentiful with many choices.There were regular shuttles to the Universal Studios Theme Park.  We chose to walk there as it was only about 1/2 mile or 10 minutes max.  Passes can be purchased from the hotel concierge - who has deals to offer.   Overall| it was a really nice place to stay and I would recommend it for the reasons above.,Dec 26| 2019,5,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

They didn’t replace used classes in our room. But the worst part is the parking. It was raining the evening we arrived| they didn’t allow us to park next to the lobby entrance to check in because there was a party and we had to park on the other side of the drive way to make room for the party guests drop off. We had to walk in the rain with luggages to enter the hotel. Then we I tried to self park| the parking lot was full again because of the party. We were directed to park on the other side of a wire gate which turned out to be the parking of Sheraton hotel next door. From there| I had to walk in the rain to go back to Hilton. The next evening| when I went to get my car| the wire gate was locked. I had to look for someone to open the gate for me. It’s a total mess. Hotel guests should have a higher priority than a one night party. You should take care of your guests first.,Dec 25| 2019,3,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

First of all this hotel is obviously very convenient to Universal and City walk.  They offer a shuttle but it's literally right up the road.  The downside is it's in a very busy area so if you aren't planning on spending a ton of time specifically at universal park or city walk it's probably not worth the cost.  The room was very quiet and comfortable with the exception of a broken thermostat.  The service at this hotel is AMAZING.

Our room started to leak from the rain and no one offered any compensation or apologies or room change! Then we went for coffee at Peet’s in the hotel.

We liked the proximity to Universal Studios Hollywood (about a 10 minute walk| uphill).  What we didn't like was the lack of street lighting on the walk back at night.  It was very dark| there was no security presence| and you have to cross the street a couple of times.  There is a hotel shuttle available. The hotel was clean| the staff was nice| we really liked the free "selfie photo booth" in the lobby| and the filtered water dispenser.  The restaurant was good for breakfast (buffet was a little pricey| we ate ala carte and were satisfied with the portions).  The water pressure could've of been better.  Not sure if this was a hotel issue or a municipal issue. And I thought $30 a day to park in the lot was expensive| should be free for guests.

The pool and hot tub were amazing.At check in| was treated like dirt. Not sure if it was because of booking with Expedia.  I was specifically told that they'd text when my room was ready.  They never did.  I told 3 separate people that I never got a text.  Met with silence.  No apology| nothing.  For that price| they should've been a lot kinder.

FANTASTIC location and room. Our stay would have been a 10+ except for a constant rattling sound in our room. We worked through it and it is important to disclose that we did not ask to move so they didn’t have a chance to correct it.,Oct 15| 2019,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
The pool and hot tub were amazing.At check in| was treated like dirt. Not sure if it was because of booking with Expedia.  I was specifically told that they'd text when my room was ready.  They never did.  I told 3 separate people that I never got a text.  Met with silence.  No apology| nothing.  For that price| they should've been a lot kinder. Was told the shuttle would take me to Universal Studios.  Had to call an $8. uber .,Oct 14| 2019,2,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

I paid $522..00 for one night.  Nonrefundable.  I arrive to check in| they gave me some hog wash story that they booked me in a room that was not useable.   So they are sending me to a hotel ten mins away.  They said they weren’t able to contact me because they had no contact information| which was a lie.    I’ve had my Expedia account for years with all current contact information .  The room they sent me to was worth 260 a night.   I was with 7 teens arriving straight from homecoming.  I picked this hotel because it was close to universal studios.  On top of that I had lost my voice because I was really sick.  I was offered no accommodations for inconvenience.  I was not offered a refund for the difference in price.  .  It was a nightmare.  They sent me on my way like it was no big deal.  The only road to get to the other hotel was passing by the Hollywood bowl| which a concert had just let out| so I was stuck in concert traffic for 30 mins.  Their customer service was no where near what’s expected from a five star.

The rides and shops were great. Most staff friendly. Acting was great from cast. The visual effects were great.Dislike... park closes at 9pm yet they don't tell you most rides and shows stop at 8pm like Zombie's|  Waterworld..etc. The cost to get express passes so you can go on any ride multiple times using  expeess lines are over $230 per person (more then 2 day pass to Disneylandwith hopper) Harry Potter ride will make you so motion sick even if youve never been sock before.  You cant being your purse on some rides| forcing you to wait in long lines to use lockers.Some staff (chick named Mitzy) that works at Mummy |gets super rude if you ask her if you can wait to get front row| even tgough everyone else had no issue with it at all.,Sep 3| 2019,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

The check in process was a little slow but there were no issues overall. The hotel has a pool| hot tub (which was not working)| room service was a little over priced but that was not really in expected. I liked the night time pool movies and even though I am a fan of “The Princess Bride” I thought a newer movie could have been shown. Then again| Princess Bride is a pretty safe movie to show. Check out was a breeze. I think this goes without saying but: the greatest amenity is the 8 minute Universal shuttle,Sep 3| 2019,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

The good news is it’s near Universal Studios. The bad news is| because it’s near Universal Studios they give an impression of not really caring. 2 rooms (of the 4 we booked) had a very strong and unpleasant smell of smoke. When we tried to change one| they mixed up the luggage collection and we had to wait nearly an hour to get our bags delivered to the new room (this was at 2 in the morning). In the morning the concierge| who we wanted to ask about tickets| was supposed to be on duty at 8am| didn’t turn up until 8.45.

Even then| we heard an inordinate amount of traffic noise. I don't know if it's cost-prohibitive to install thicker windows. Note: It was STILL a great stay!- Could not control: LA Traffic.

Property is close to Universal Studios (walkable) . However| upon checking in the front desk clerk is less to be desired. She had the personality of someone who hates her job. She put us on the 2nd floor in a handicap room without informing  us. My husband is 6’4 and the shower was very low for him. Plus ..NO hot water for a shower at the end of our day. My husband| 2 little girls and myself had to take cold showers. We waited to see if the water would warm up by letting it run for a few minutes.No success.Wallpaper was peeling in the bathroom. No hair dryer. Location is great| lady at the front desk was inconvenienced by our simple questions.We usually stay at Hilton’s when traveling every year| but this location is a HUGE disappointment. Only plus is the close proximity to the park. 5-7 minute walk .,Aug 5| 2019,2,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

We had to use the hideabed couch and it was AWFUL!!! These need to be replaced if you are advertising that they are an asset to the room as a matter of fact I think the one in our room was broken!Everything else was great| comfortable enough bed and very lively room with an awesome view,Aug 5| 2019,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
Stayed here for my daughters bday and went to universal city walk and universal studios. They have a shuttle that takes you back and forth which is nice.,Aug 5| 2019,5,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
Great place to stay near Universal Studios| only thing was our shower was leaking a lot of water to the floor.  Other than that| we will definitely stay here again when we come visit.  The pool is also amazing| especially at night.,Aug 5| 2019,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

Property is close to Universal Studios (walkable) . However| upon checking in the front desk clerk is less to be desired. She had the personality of someone who hates her job. She put us on the 2nd floor in a handicap room without informing  us. My husband is 6’4 and the shower was very low for him. Plus ..NO hot water for a shower at the end of our day. My husband| 2 little girls and myself had to take cold showers. We waited to see if the water would warm up by letting it run for a few minutes.No success.Wallpaper was peeling in the bathroom. No hair dryer. Location is great| lady at the front desk was inconvenienced by our simple questions.We usually stay at Hilton’s when traveling every year| but this location is a HUGE disappointment. Only plus is the close proximity to the park. 5-7 minute walk .,Aug 5| 2019,2,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
Busy| but comfortable hotel. Great location. Room was great| but avoid the sofa bed if you can! Very uncomfortable. Staff were lovely and bar area and food were great too. Overall| great stay| but quite pricey.,Aug 4| 2019,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

Unfortunately| we had a quite a few issues... It started with our shower leaking and our AC unit was not functioning right. While out on our first day| they said they fixed both| but our shower still leaked (just not as much as the 1st day)| and| then the AC motor blew on day 4 or 5. They asked us to move our room as we had 2 nights left. So we had to pack and unpack again. We were a family of 4. We went from 2 queen beds to 2 doubles| which was tight. Not that this is a big deal| but we checked in as a family of 4 and had to request "every day" for an extra towel(s) and wash cloth(s) as they would only leave between 1 and 3. We would hang them in the shower to reuse| but they took them. (Not to mention the extra towels we would need when the shower leaked).They did apologize and offered us a 2 day complimentary breakfast buffet (a $30 pp value)| but the food was not that good. We made the best of our trip| but the hotel was somewhat disappointing.It is listed as a 4 STAR Hotel| we call it a 3 STAR at best.,Jul 31| 2019,3,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

The most terrible thing is internet policy. When you arrive at Hotel like this| you expect free internet. But... They have some spam policy to register as Hilton member and you'll get free internet. I registered on 3 email's and didn't got internet so I purchased. It was real dissapointment. Internet costs 8 $| when you pay for room hundrets dollars| they can't include this fee. So basically they wan't you to have bad experience at hotel. It's not how high quality service works. Its not 2000| free internet is everywhere in the world| but not at this hotel. Thats why I put low score on service and comfort. That was most terrible experience during holidays.,Jul 18| 2019,3,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
I was a bit surprised that this property doesn't have a kid section on the room service menu.  When I called for room service one evening for my children and I| I was told there was no kids meals available.    I asked if they could do just a pasta with butter which they were able to accommodate for $16 for one of my daughters| I also ordered a chicken tenders with fries for my other daughter that was also not on the menu but they told me they could not do a child portion only an adult portion.  The pool menu also didn't have a kids section but our fabulous server offered us a variety of kids meals for $10 which was great.  I think the hotel should offer a kids section on the room service menu| I imagine given its location to Universal Studios that guests would appreciate the addition. Room Service delivery was prompt and the delivery servers were nice.  Also| it's unfortunate that they do not offer wi-fi for free to all guests| like most hotels seem to do these days.  You have to be a HHilton Honors member to receive free wi-fi and book directly with Hilton.

The bathtub rod  is rusted.  The bathroom is kind of small| so if you are traveling with your family you may want a bigger bathroom. Also there is not much counter space. We made due my storing toiletries in the gorges.,Jul 6| 2019,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
The neighbors with kids were very loud every night| we were also getting a real strong odor of weed coming from next door neighbor. Toilet was leaking| it was fixed the next day but then it was flushing on its own throughout the night. They fixed it. Overall it was an unpleasant stay.,Jul 5| 2019,2,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

Our first stay was for one night. Everything was great until we went to check out. Our car was vandalized while parked in thier secure valet parking lot that cost us about 50 dollars to park. We spent 4 hours of our vacation messing with reports and law enforcment. While the hotels fix was to offer another night at a dicounted rate. So we returned a few days later to try again. Thier fix was a bottom floor room with only one bed for 3 of us. The room was small and the shower was a handicap shower so you had to lean down or sit down to wash because it did not work properly. To top it off they made me pay 200 dollars for this. Needless to say we where highly unsatisfied with the hotel apology and will not be staying there again. Consider going to the Sheraton that has the same shuttle to the amusement park.,Jun 25| 2019,2,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

The hot tub was closed for maitenance one day which was not so fun as I paid over 100 dollars more to stay at this hotel for the hot tub specifically. The coffee area was horrible food and way overpriced as well as the room service food quality. The positives are the room was very nice.  The hotel was very close to universal studios and the pool area was very nice as well. They have the comfortable chairs gated off for I guess reservations.

Dinner in the restaurant was just okay| for 2 of us the 3rd a pizza didn’t arrive until after we were done eating and the waiter “dropped” it on the table and said just take it I’ll take it off your bill.

The hotel is a good 10-15 min walk to Universal Studios uphill. The air conditioning in our room did not work and we were transferred to another room. The hotel is fair but you can be overlooked due to sheer volume of people staying at the hotel. There are no shops nearby for basic amenities and its very far from anywhere.

Great hotel!  Clean rooms| comfortable beds| friendly staff| well stocked convenience store| and three options for food and beverages on the main floor. Free shuttle to Universal City Walk also.,May 27| 2019,5,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
It was an okay stay. Rooms on the smaller size. The best thing about this hotel is the proximity to Universal Studios. We visited a few hotels during spring break. This one rated middle of the road. Parking fees are ridiculous.,May 24| 2019,3,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
The Grounds and lobby were spotless and very well-kept and the room was mostly clean but had some small marks and stains etc.The room we were given did not have the view we paid for we had a good view of roads and not much else when we expected a view of the universal studios this was disappointing.We had a bad experience with the staff at breakfast attempting to overcharge us.We were happy with the filtered water which was free in the lobby.Overall for the price| I feel we should have had a different experience..,May 23| 2019,2,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

This was our first big family trip to a theme park so I picked the closest hotel to the park. Check in was a breeze and the valet was quick and friendly. The room was big and clean. Beds were firm and the bathroom was big and stocked with enough towels for my whole family. We used the hot tub and heated pool after our day of travel and it was perfect tempature. They provided towels in the pool area which not all hotels do. They came in a made our beds while we were gone the next day and even stocked up our coffee which I have never had done with other hotels. My daughter had a good laugh because they wrapped her stuffed pig like a baby with her blanket and left it on her pillow.  We will defineltly be back for our next visit.

The property is beautiful with a fabulous location. However it does not offer amenities that satisfy the name Hilton.  One example is the in room coffee- cheap bitter packets in a tiny coffee maker.

From the bell captains (thanks Jo-Nathan) to the restaurant servers (great chatting with you Amy)| this property is one of the beat we stayed at ever. Room size perfect -and we are two large adults and two teens. Bathroom lovely. Beds and bedding comfortable. And I could see HOGWARTS from our room!! Extra $ for the view but totally worth it to us. $65 pp weekend dinner buffet— sounds expensive but you WILL get your money’s Worth. Pool (heated!) a little too crowded but attentive staff and good pool grub and bar.,Apr 21| 2019,5,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

Great stay as we were going to Universal Studios and you could not have got closer.  BUT the hotel is scruffy and needs some tlc to be able to compare itself to the Theme Park.   The restaurant food was terrible| and the service in the restaurant at night was not good at all.  However in the morning the breakfast was just lovely and the wait staff were delightful.   The bar area was fine but that too could do with a face lift.  Over all it served the purpose of being in the right location for our needs but overall was disappointing.

The pull out sofa was dirty I requested service on the pull out| and although one of the ladies came soon she did not put clean sheets on the pull out sofa| after she opened it and left the room smell like dirty feet!  The ladies at the restaurant was snobby and not cooperative. I was promised a complementary rolling bed and it never arrived. My daughter an I (62 years old) had to move the heavy glass center table in the room| with a 2 year old it was dangerous.,Apr 20| 2019,1,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

The property is beautiful with a fabulous location. However it does not offer amenities that satisfy the name Hilton.  One example is the in room coffee- cheap bitter packets in a tiny coffee maker.  At a Hilton I expect quality everything but inside the room it is dime store items.,Apr 21| 2019,3,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

From the bell captains (thanks Jo-Nathan) to the restaurant servers (great chatting with you Amy)| this property is one of the beat we stayed at ever. Room size perfect -and we are two large adults and two teens. Bathroom lovely. Beds and bedding comfortable. And I could see HOGWARTS from our room!! Extra $ for the view but totally worth it to us. $65 pp weekend dinner buffet— sounds expensive but you WILL get your money’s Worth. Pool (heated!) a little too crowded but attentive staff and good pool grub and bar.,Apr 21| 2019,5,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
Amazing | great room| great food| and a great time,Apr 21| 2019,5,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
Great stay as we were going to Universal Studios and you could not have got closer.  BUT the hotel is scruffy and needs some tlc to be able to compare itself to the Theme Park.   The restaurant food was terrible| and the service in the restaurant at night was not good at all.  However in the morning the breakfast was just lovely and the wait staff were delightful.   The bar area was fine but that too could do with a face lift.  Over all it served the purpose of being in the right location for our needs but overall was disappointing.  It felt like a tired hotel near the airport :(,Apr 20| 2019,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

The hotel was nice. We sat down for cocktails and my wife's drink (manhattan) had bugs in the bottom. The waiter asked if it happened at the table and I told him I have no way of knowing but he should check the cherries. He came back with a fresh drink and said it was comp'd and asked if I wanted another. Later I checked the bill and saw that he comp'd her drink with bugs but still charged us for her remake. I don't think this was normal behavior and the bartender and waiter (Sergio) acted truly surprised| but could have made our experience better by at least buying her the second drink| if not both our drinks.,Apr 15| 2019,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

Twice I was cut in front of by others and the staff did nothing. Also| the fridge did not work| there was a big yellow stain on our sheets| the remote did not work| and the fan in the bathroom didn’t work. We let it be known but was never re-engaged on the matter.

Twice I had someone cut in front of me at the concierge and check in desks and the employees just let them.,Mar 22| 2019,2,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
Rooms are very spacious| friendly staff| pool is open late (until midnight)| Peet’s Coffee onsite| great views. My only complaint (and this isn’t specific to this hotel only) is that the walk to Universal isn’t all that convenient. I wish there was a bridge that went directly to the hotel area spas to avoid walking in the traffic.,Mar 18| 2019,5,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

We were coming into LA from Denver for a quick trip to celebrate my niece's 10th birthday at Universal Studios.  The location was perfect.  It was a quick walk back and forth.  We had drinks at the bar and had breakfast at the buffet.  The bartender was very polite and caring.  He even went out of his way to get my son a band aid w/ointment for a small injury that my son had.  The buffet was great.  Lots of choices and the food tasted awesome.

Booked a room with views of the park and couldn't have asked for anything more it was beautiful at night! However| if you plan to take a shower make sure hot water comes out because I had to take a bath in order to have hot water because the shower water was ice cold!

I am shocked that we spent $250 on a one night stay. The room was nothing special. The bed was not that comfortable and than there wasn’t even an included continental breakfast. We had to pay $28 additional just to park and if we wanted the “continental” breakfast it was $30 a person!

Beautiful hotel and close to the airport however the walls are thin and you can hear the people in the next room.  The complementary beverage and snack in the evening was fair.  If you are around 12 or 13 years old  like the sports teams that were staying at the hotel| you would particularly like it because it involved nacho cheese| animal crackers and cheese its. 😜,Jan 25| 2019,3,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

It was an amazing hotel| in a great area| there were just a few minor mishaps. 1st thing was that our room was freezing most of our trip| an engineer had to come fix the heat| the remote to the TV didn’t work| also for the expensive price| it would have been nice if the room came with a microwave and the shuttle only took us to and from Universal but not to any other close landmarks| lik Hollywood Bvd| Sunset Blvd.,Jan 15| 2019,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

Excellent location for visiting Universal| or as a home base for seeing sights in the Hollywood area.

It was an amazing hotel| in a great area| there were just a few minor mishaps. 1st thing was that our room was freezing most of our trip| an engineer had to come fix the heat| the remote to the TV didn’t work| also for the expensive price| it would have been nice if the room came with a microwave and the shuttle only took us to and from Universal but not to any other close landmarks| lik Hollywood Bvd| Sunset Blvd.,Jan 15| 2019,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

Great location for Rose Bowl and Universal. Very high dollar breakfast buffet that was just very ordinary| do not waste your money. Did not have hot water one of the mornings. Ran out of hot water in middle of my wife's shower| just imagine yourself if this happened. Tried to walk to Universal one night and was rerouted to a longer walk due to private party in one of the banquet rooms. They were very rude about it as we were walking! Had walked t hat route at least three times before this without issue. Pool was closed for work?,Jan 3| 2019,3,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
They checked us in to the hotel knowing that there was no hot water though out the entire building! We were with having to take a shower for 2 days!!! They claim that they could not give us money back on the hotel room because we pre paid so there "compensation" was for a $75.00 food voucher! One of the women I spoke to at the front desk was soo rude...when I called to ask about the water| she told me "she was not maintenance| that was not her job"!!! Was a very frustrating experiance and now that I know pre paying through a site like this| if something goes wrong| I will not be compensated!!!,Jan 3| 2019,1,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

The only unique thing was the view | the things I didn’t like was the lack of comunicación between the staff and the client | also extra charges that I didn’t order or ask for it so basically they are thanking to rip-off clients,Dec 25| 2018,1,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
The property is in a good location and I like the shuttle to Universal Studios. The hotel had a Starbucks in it but it’s no longer there which is unfortunate. It’s nice to have a less expensive option than the restaurant in the hotel. I have stayed at this property several times in the past so I was really excited to have my son experience it. I had never had a bad experience here before so I was really caught off guard when my son| daughter and I were returning from dinner in West Hollywood. Our Lyft which had picked us up at the lobby| was not allowed to come onto the property when we returned from a late dinner. One of the parking attendants that I noticed when we originally arrived on the property earlier stopped our driver when we first turned from Universal Drive to the road that takes you up the hill to the Hilton. He told the driver that he could not take us up the hill to the hotel. We had to get out| in the dark| and walk up thehill to the hotel. We attempted to enter the hotel near the Hilton ballroom but we were turned away and told to go further up the hill. This was absolutely ridiculous. I had my two children walking by myself in the dark to the hotel. There was no other traffic at this time and it was extremely dark out. To say the least| my son was not impressed and we will not be back. That was dangerous.,Dec 24| 2018,3,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

The front desk is not friendly. I asked for room change since they gave me a very low floor room. They had no smile and said we sold out and do not have room left. I asked again to double check. The woman said we only have one room with two double beds available (I booked two queen beds from Expedia). Also| she said that you cannot change room again if you do not satisfy with the bed size.

The shower dripped extremely loud all night.  We reported it the next day.  They sent someone in there to fix it and texted us while at Universal asked us to move rooms.  When we said we were at the park for the day| they never followed through with either the move nor the fixing of the faucet so we got experience the dripping again a 2nd night.  There were hairs on shower and bathroom wallpaper.  The one breakfast we had in the restaurant served my son raw french toast.  It was gooey and totally uncooked.  The waiter was very nice about it though and got him a waffle| but by then we were all done with our meal.  The ladies restroom nearest the conference rooms was completely out of toilet paper and the patrons were left to use up all of the Kleenex.  I myself only had one piece of Kleenex to use.

“Corner Room (Universal View)” implies a view. In fact the room was on floor 2| one level below the lobby level| and the only view was of an access road behind the hotel. Water temperature in the bathroom sink was extremely difficult to adjust. The cold water tap put out hot water and the hot water tap put out VERY hot water. It took awhile to figure out that you had to run the cold water about 30 seconds before it cooled down| then you had to open the cold tap all the way and crack the hot tap just slightly; anything else would produce scalding hot water. I’ve never seen anything like it.,Nov 4| 2018,2,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

This hotel was amazing.  We stayed one night for HHN at Universal Studios across the street.  It's clean| the lady at the front desk was super nice| check-in was quick and parking was easy to find.  Not to mention| the hotel is also a convenient and fast walk to Universal Studios which was my main reason for staying here.  My only gripe is the elevator going down to the parking garage was in the hallway to the ballroom| which made it very awkward having to walk through a convention full of people with our luggage in tow| but I'm only nitpicking.,Oct 31| 2018,5,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
Cleanliness of area around walkway of hotel was not particularly good with dog poop on the main path of the hotel. Sadly this was not cleared up during the day and remained on the path until the next day where it was trodden in. Room was comfortable but had a bit of a musty odour to it which I didn't expect. Pool area was very nice with a heated pool that could be used from early in the morning until midnight. Freshly laundered pool towels also provided. Jacuzzi tub very warm. Views out the hillside were lovely too. Just very unfortunate about the cleanliness of the beautifully landscaped walkway. I was under the impression that this hotel was only 0.1 miles from Universal studios - as the crow flies yes it is - but in reality the walk to the hotel is further than this and parts are uphill so be mindful if you have mobility issues.,Oct 31| 2018,3,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

Very nice staff and great location for Universal Studios. That said| had a cold shower the 2nd morning due to lack of hot water (about 8:30am) and there was a pipe in one of the walls that made a lot of noise--Room 1468--(white noise for me that normally would have helped me sleep| but annoyed my wife so I got to share her experience). Probably should have asked to switch rooms| but we already had the kids and both of us unpacked and once you are in bed trying to fall asleep you don't want to make a move.

My husband and I were celebrating his birthday and they brought up cake and strawberries as a treat for him. The room was excellent| comfortable and the view was exactly as I had requested. In the past the hotel has been under various  types of renovation and it was hard to get around and I thought that the staff was a little harried.  This visit was quite magical. The check in process was smooth| the bellhops held onto our bags until our room was ready (we were there early in the morning and spent the day at universal studios)| the restaurant staff was pleasant and seemingly at our beck and call.,Oct 22| 2018,5,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

Very convenient location. The room was large and comfortable.,Oct 22| 2018,5,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

We’ve stayed at this hotel several times over the past years. The staff was exceptional on this visit. My husband and I were celebrating his birthday and they brought up cake and strawberries as a treat for him. The room was excellent| comfortable and the view was exactly as I had requested. In the past the hotel has been under various  types of renovation and it was hard to get around and I thought that the staff was a little harried.  This visit was quite magical. The check in process was smooth| the bellhops held onto our bags until our room was ready (we were there early in the morning and spent the day at universal studios)| the restaurant staff was pleasant and seemingly at our beck and call.,Oct 22| 2018,5,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

Our stay here was very nice. The rooms were really nice and we had the view of the Universal Studios park. Super close to Universal and City Walk. Free shuttle if you don't feel like walkingThe only drawback I would say would be the price of everything from room service to the onsite restaurant was super expensive.,Oct 19| 2018,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

We changed rooms 3 times. The first time it was so noisy from the laundry and the lifts going up and down. Second room the fold out bed was so old and uncomfortable it was impossible to sleep on. The third room was ok but small.

The hotel is nice and a short walk to Universal Studios.  The room| however| smelled liked mildew.  It was horrible.   There was no fan in the shower and the room windows would steam up whenever anyone took a shower.   The lack of bathroom ventilation might be why the entire room smelled like mildew and mold.   We were only staying 2 nights| but would not book this hotel again due to the odor.,Oct 12| 2018,2,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
We were on the 17th floor and our view was amazing. The room was roomy with a king bed and couch as well as a small desk. The bathroom had a shower and tub| but the plug didnt work so i was dissappointed when i tried to take a bath. There were stains on the carpet and the shower curtain that were offputting.

I loved how close it was to the park. It was clean and nicely decorated. The bed was comfortable and the sheets weresoft. The kids next door to us were loud which is understandable but the gap under the door between our rooms was too big and let all the noise in. I was also sad there wasn’t a bathtub. I guess that’s what hotels are doing now—putting in big showers. Very nice place though and I would stay there again.,Oct 6| 2018,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

The room was great. If you stay there| ask for a corner room.  The entire one wall was windows and the views were great.We checked out and went to the restaurant for breakfast| that ended at 11am. the only option was a $60 per person!!!!! buffet. That's more than any high end hotel in Las Vegas.  Had we known| we would have ordered room service and it would have been a 1/3 the price!  They also get you for $28 a night parking.,Oct 1| 2018,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
Hotel was really nice. Customer service was amazing! I would go back just based on that. Universal Studios was a 10min walk from the hotel with a small hill to walk up going to and from the park. They also have a shuttle but it gets super full during peek times(park opening/ closing/ Horror Nights). Room was pretty spacious and the bathroom was huge. I would definitely recommend staying here if you plan on going to Universal or if you just want a really friendly and amazing hotel.,Oct 1| 2018,5,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
Overall i really loved this hotels location| design| customer service and amenities. We visited just for 1 night to attend Hollywood Horror Nights 9/29/18. Although my neice and I experienced a couple of minor hiccups in service| it was promptly corrected. The first hiccup was....Upon arrival of any hotel I pull of sheets and inspect the mattress| i found some small stains on some of the sheets. I called the front desk and asked if they could change the sheets. They apologized and asked if i would like to change rooms. I said changing the sheets would suffice. Within 20 minutes a housekeeper came to change the sheets. The second hiccup was when we arrived back to our room around 2:30am from the event I ordered ice cream on the overnight menu by way of the TV ordering service. The TV indicated that it would arrive within 30 minutes. We waited up over an hour and the ice cream never arrived. When i checked out i wanted to verify that i wasnt charged for something i never received| the front desk said I was not....and on their end it doesnt show i ordered anything. The front desk employee was very apologetic and offered me a $20 voucher to their coffee cafe. I really appreciated the overall concern with these minor issues. My neice and I enjoyed the property and will definitely make it our go to hotel when visiting Universal in the future!,Oct 1| 2018,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

My wife and I stayed at this hotel for four nights to see Universal and the Hollywood area.  We stayed in an Executive level room| which I highly recommend because if comes with a great continental breakfast| which normally runs $20 per person.  The hotel was clean and the staff friendly.  The service around the pool seemed to focus strictly on the cabanas which made it hard to get a drink.,Sep 13| 2018,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

The Hilton is the closest hotel to Universal Park| which is about a 5-10 minute walk| but they do have a shuttle. Rooms are big and comfortable| staff is nice| and they have a $25 early check-in option available for early arrivers. My only slight complaint| and it's not with the hotel| but when using Lyft| the Hilton is not an option - it's always the main entrance to Universal| which gets a little annoying if you use Lyft frequently on the trip.,Sep 9| 2018,5,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

Loved how convenient this location was to Universal Hollywood and city walk. So easy to walk and safe. We were upgraded to a corner room with a beautiful view of the hillside homes and sunsets!

It is a perfect choice if you plan on spending most of your time at Universal Studios. I was able to save on parking and walk for most of my stay.

Check in staff was great very helpful and efficient. Room was beautiful| clean and in good repair although the bed was very firm. Be clear about the breakfast option| the universal breakfast buffet was $30.00 a head for pretty standard buffet| in fairness we should have asked about the price| but we’re a bit shocked when we were presented a bill for $100 + tax  for a small breakfast for 3.

We asked for 2 more but never delivered after an hour wait and at 9:30 pm we put up no disturbed sign and went to bed.

Good hotel| walking distance to Universal Studios and City Walk. Only downfall $28 + tax for daily parking if you have a rental.,Aug 25| 2018,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
We liked the corner room and comfy bed.We didn't like the price of the adult buffet.  One can only eat so much in one sitting....though the food WAS delicious.,Aug 25| 2018,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

Great hotel and location BUT the AC in my room was not working properly and it was very hot there. Hotel sent up a fan but that just circulated the hot air.plus toilet was blocked day after my arrival.Otherwise| OK,Aug 24| 2018,3,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
Our stay went very well. The staff were professional in every way. The hotel was in an excellent location to what we were doing. The room and grounds were very clean at all times. I would recommend the hotel to anyone who wants a clean and well kept place. They might just see a movie star there as I did. The place is a plus!,Aug 24| 2018,5,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

Do not stay at the Hilton unless you can afford the executive suites. If you're not staying in the executive floors| the staff pretends to care and "make it right" but ultimately doesnt care and the problems dont get fixed. We had very low water pressure in our room and the beds had "body groves" in them (similar to a but grove in a chair you've had for a long time). They attempt to hide this by using a mattress padding cover instead of just replacing the mattresses. I notified the front desk of our problems and they couldnt move us claiming the hotel was fully booked. I made several complaints to multiple different front desk staff but ultimately| nothing was done. This terrible experience soured our vacation at Universal Studios as we just didnt feel comfortable or taken care of as you would expect from a 1st class hotel. I asked for a refund and was only given one free day of parking and told no refunds since we booked through expedia. I did purchase travel insurance but Im pretty sure that wont help either. Our stay totally sucked. Never staying with Hilton again... EVER! :(,Aug 17| 2018,1,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
Staff was friendly and helpful   My room was very clean spacious and had a beautiful view | I enjoyed my stay| highly recommended this hotel| not very far from sightseeing activities.

2019年末に、家族旅行で利用しました。チェックイン開始時間を2時間以上過ぎて、チェックインしたにも関わらず、部屋のクリーニングが済んでいないから、1時間待てと、一言の謝罪も無しに言われました。9ヶ月以上前から予約している旨、伝えると、横にいた別担当者がその担当にメモを渡して、直ぐに部屋が用意されました。その時の受け付け担当者の問題かも知れませんが、受付対応は、最悪です。数年後に利用した際の、週末開催のビュッフェが美味しかったので、今回も利用しましたが、今回は、全ての料理がグレードダウンしており、ほぼ、美味しく食べられる料理か、ありませんでした。このヒルトンは、もう利用しないと思います。,Jan 7| 2020,1,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

L'hôtel est très bien situé si on veut visiter Universal ! Les studios Universal sont à 7 minutes à pied. Il y a un parking à l'hôtel| assez cher. Nous avions réservé une chambre avec grand lit et un canapé-lit (celui-ce n'était pas du tout confortable !)| sans petit-déjeuner pour le prix de CHF. 360.-/nuit. Pour ce prix| l'hôtel pourrait mettre deux vrais grands lits et au moins faire le lit d'appoint à l'avance ... L'isolation de la baie vitrée n'est pas bonne et on entend pas mal le trafic de l'autoroute en contre-bas. Il n'y a qu'une paterre dans la salle de bains ... pour pendre 4 linges. Un verre sale était posé sur la moquette dans le hall à l'extérieur de notre porte lors de notre arrivée ... et il y était toujours 36 heures plus tard.

Nice hotel close to Universal Studios with walking distance| but there are shuttle busses as well also for handicap/wheel shares. Nice hotel| with nice bar| restaurant| etc. We had our most expensive breakfast ever at this hotel buffé with nearly 40 dollar per person incl. normal tips. If you go to Universal Studios buy express pass to all prior to your visit on internet (sheeper) or in the lobby (more expensive) at the hotel in high seasons| which gives you one express entré to each attraction once.,Jul 7| 2019,5,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

Die Wege sind in LA eigentlich nicht weit| aber der wahnsinnige Verkehr führt dazu| dass man für 20 Min.-Fahrt schon mal 1|5 Std. benötigt. Daher wollten wir einen guten Startpunkt für unsere Ausflüge in die Universal und Warner Bros. Studios| dem Observatory und für die obligatorische LA-Touristentour. Wir entschieden uns für die Universal City| da wir sehr früh am Morgen in die Universal Studios starten wollten und weil wir uns so nur einen Tag quer durch die Stadt (nach Downtown) mit dem Auto kämpfen mussten. Man muss allerdings sagen| dass Universal City dort oben natürlich nicht das "echte" LA ist. Wenn man das erleben will| sollte man sich je nach Geschmack ein Hotel in Hollywood oder Downtown suchen (bekommt für denselben Preis dann aber eben auch mal nur muffige Motels). Für uns war das Hilton optimal und bis auf die hohen Parkhauskosten (glaube die lagen ca. bei $40/Tag) waren wir rundum zufrieden. Sehr saubere (und große!) Zimmer| sehr kompetentes freundliches Personal und tolle Aussicht über die Stadt. Zu Fuß ist man sehr schnell auf dem City Walk| wo immer was los ist und sich Geschäfte und Restaurants aneinanderreihen. Für Fußlahme fährt auch ein Shuttle die paar Meter vom Hotel zum Eingang der Studios. Gegessen haben wir im Hotel nicht| daher können wir dazu nichts sagen.,Jun 28| 2019,5,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

全体的には満足です。ユニバーサルスタジオ、シティウォークに歩いてける距離です。シャトルもありますが、時間によっては混んだりなどもするので便利でした。チケットもホテルで購入でき、アーリーエントリーにも対応していました。部屋も綺麗でした。アメニティもひと通り揃っています。もちろん歯ブラシはありませんが。コーヒー、紅茶もセットされてますが、ボトルウォーターはありません。wifiは基本有料ですが、ヒルトンメンバーであれば無料で使えます。(登録は無料です)難を言えばショップの開店時間をもう少し長くしてほしいです。水とかが買えず、駐車場のところにある自販機で買いました。またフロントのスタッフが少ない時があり、タイミングによっては並ぶことがあります。駐車場はセルフなら1日28ドル、出し入れ自由で便利です。Downtowまでも10マイルもなく、車ならすぐに行ける距離でしたので便利でした。食事もシティウォークやホテルで取れますし、車でも行けました。ユニバーサルに行く方であれば十分満足できるホテルだと思います。,Apr 29| 2019,4,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
Stort (opersonligt) och dyrt hotell med trevlig pool och bra läge nära Universal City.Fick ett rätt trevligt rum (med två sängar då vi var 2 vuxna och två barn som reste). Inte ny renoverat eller så men ändå trevligt. Vi hade två queen-size sängar| upplevde dem som lite smalare än på andra hotell (kanske 140cm istället för 160cm)| funkade ändå bra.Sängarna hade väldigt tjocka täcken| vi skulle klart föredragit tunnare täcken och inte behövt köra AC så hårt men det antar jag är en smaksak...Frukost gick inte att få inkluderat och kostade rätt mycket att köra till 20$/pers (mindre buffe) 30$/pers (full buffe).WiFi var inte inkluderat på rummet. Det gick att få genom att ansluta sig till Hiltons kundklubb men som sagt inte fritt.Sammanlagt lite blandat intryck från oss| dyrt och opersonligt men fräscht och bra läge.,Apr 26| 2019,3,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

環境非常棒，可以走路到影城遊玩；房間整理乾淨舒適，很多生活用品如牙膏、牙刷、浴帽、拖鞋沒有供應，我很認同此環保訴求，可是需要在訂單中詳細說明；另外在訂單中明明有標註"住房內有 free wi-fi"，但實際是完全沒有；在訂單中也說明可以免費多加一張折疊床，我卻收到一封飯店來信說要加35美元/天。訂單中的內容，跟實際入住，確實有相當高的落差。還有，沖澡的浴室會漏水到外面，有點瞎。,Apr 15| 2019,3,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608

유니버셜스튜디오를 가기에는 적합한위치였던거같아요.저흰 유니버셜과 디즈니를 가기위해서 그곳에 숙박했던거였는데 막히는시간이아닐때에는 힐튼에서 디즈니까지45분정도걸렸네요..청결도는 괜찮았는데 룸에 비치되어있는 용품이 너무간단했던거같네요. 칫솔도없고 치약도없고 빗도없고 비누랑 샴푸|트리트먼트밖에없었어요..뷰는 정말멋졌는데 층별 안내도같은것도없고..너무간단하게되어있네요..ㅋ 조식은 나쁘진않았는데 간이다 너무짰어요..,Feb 20| 2019,3,Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City,555 Universal Hollywood Dr| Universal City| CA| 91608
Room size is okay but the facility is way too old. Carpet is dirty and dusty. You can hear the noise from next room and the hall way. Renovation is needed.The only advantage is the walking distance to the Universal Studio.Parking fee is also high.
