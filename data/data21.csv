Very disappointed. Booked through hotels.com . Excited about the breakfast. But when I arrived. There wasn’t any breakfast. Just a brown bag with a very small yogurt. A disgusting breakfast sandwich that the bread crumbled in your hand . Your lucky if you got one with a napkin or a spoon . 4 days 4 guesses.The description of the rooms were off. A city view is just looking at another’s building.The vineyard view (not sure were a vineyard is in nyc)but you get a beautiful view of the harbor. Wont make that mistake again.,Aug 18| 2021,2,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
The staff were friendly| the hotel and room were clean| and the bed was comfortable. I would definitely stay there again.,Aug 16| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
Liked that we had a awesomeview,Aug 16| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
This property is closer to some of the attractions and also conveniently located to take ferries or train to other attractions which we liked the most|,Aug 14| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
Everything was great and the staff helpful and friendly.,Aug 13| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
Property was at waking distance from multiple attractions in Uptown Manhattan,Aug 9| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
The property was great. Loved the location and it's easy access to the subway. I however did not like the setup of the bathroom. The door did not close all the way.,Aug 8| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
Clean room. Friendly staff. Excellent views.  Convenient location.,Aug 7| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
Friendly staff felt very welcomed after a long drive.  Quiet and the subway station was nearby.  Great stay!  I Will def stay again.,Aug 4| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
Check in late at night| to find my room completely dirty| with hair all over the bathroom and the shower clogged. They didn't even offer a room change. They set staff to take care of the clogged| but ultimately I had to clean the shower. Next day asked to be cleaned and they only cleaned the shower| they didn't even make an effort to do the rest. Very disappointing!!,Aug 3| 2021,1,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
Overall great accommodations - location| convenience| attentive friendly staff| cleanliness and an amazing view from our room!,Aug 2| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
The site said restaurant. There was no restaurant. Site said valet parking. There was no valet parking. Couldn’t have room cleaned,Aug 1| 2021,2,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
The location was very convenient. Lots of choices for food and public transportation across the street. The room also had a microwave and mini fridge. The only thing that bothered me was the stale smell in the room.,Aug 1| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
Great staff,Jul 28| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
The room was really comfortable| and so was the view!,Jul 27| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
The view overlooking The Hudson from the 21st floor was fabulous! Clean rooms| friendly staff and very quiet.,Jul 26| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
I really liked this hotel and location. The staff was friendly| but seemed to be a bit understaffed. I was disappointed to learn after check in that the restaurant was closed.,Jul 25| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
Though we had a good experience with the manager and service desk staff we were a little dissappointed that even the basic items such as trash can| laundry bag and enough towels for the guests checking in were missing in the room. But the staff were very friendly and responsive.,Jul 19| 2021,3,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
The location of this hotel is excellent to say the least. Too many restaurants to choose from and to walk around the area as well. Too many to see in New York. The staff was pleased and welcoming to us. Check in and out was quick. Our room had a great view to the bridge. If I have to say something negative is the TV didnt work but other than that it was a great stay.,Jul 19| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
It was okayExpected more since it received a superb rating on lineThe staff who checked me in was niceBut the hotel just okayPaid for breakfast restaurant was closed.They offered some type of I’m guessing a bagged breakfast but did not sound appealing.Parking very expensive,Jul 18| 2021,3,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004

This property is close to my job. On a couple of occasions I’ve stayed here after working prolonged hours. While the convenience is great| the insulation is poor. You can hear vehicles drive by| horns honking etc even from the 14th floor. If you’re tired it works best for a shower and knock out.,Mar 14| 2020,3,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
Nice room| great shower. Overall very good. If I have two complaints it's that the hotel bar is tiny and secondly and more importantly I could hear street noise on my 22nd floor room that I don't pick up at other hotels.

the stay was awesome however the shower door only opened one way and the door didnt close all the way cause the wall was crooked. so when you took a shower the door would roll open letting the water out on the floor. not only that since the one side was solid when you turned the water on to adjust the temp would would get sprayed and wett. so when you shower make sure you are undressed before you turn the water on and adjust it after getting undressed.,Feb 17| 2020,5,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004

I loved my room here. It was nice size with a beautiful view (don’t hesitate on a ‘City View’ room| it’s worth it) and also complimentary Neutrogena products. The bed was also comfy.

The staff could not have been more friendly and even assisted us with an early check in. The room was clean and comfortable and the elevator very fast. The lobby was nice and my friend was very happy that coffee was already made and waiting downstairs every morning. The location is very close to the subway and the Staten Island ferry as well as drugstores and bagel shops so it was perfect for us. It was also very quiet. It was a nice getaway from the crowds and noise in Midtown.,Jan 2| 2020,5,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004

The staff could not have been more friendly and even assisted us with an early check in. The room was clean and comfortable and the elevator very fast. The lobby was nice and my friend was very happy that coffee was already made and waiting downstairs every morning. The location is very close to the subway and the Staten Island ferry as well as drugstores and bagel shops so it was perfect for us. It was also very quiet. It was a nice getaway from the crowds and noise in Midtown.,Jan 2| 2020,5,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004

I was surprised how big the room was compared to some other hitels I have stayed in NYC. The staff has to be the BEST hitel staff I've ever deakt with. They accomadated me with a early check in (1130AM) and gave me a room on their lowest floor (that was also a early request). The staff well you can't get any better. Rooms were clean and comfortable just an outstanding hotel. The only setback would be no free breakfast that would make this hotel a 10 for sure but it still gets a 9.5.,Nov 12| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004

Beautiful space| easy check in| just an odd experience.,Jul 31| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004

It bit disappointed really| staff were friendly and the check in was great.  The floor we were on was a tired and dirty.  We stayed five nights and every day| for the whole day and night| there was a hoover and the cleaners cupboard outside our room was open!!  The hotel was great for access all things Manhattan.  The room was small| but I guess that is the thing with Garden Inn's.  We have stayed at hundreds of Hilton Brand Hotels around the world and I think its time to shift our loyalty now.,Jul 7| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
The check in process was simple and quick| the room was clean and large enough for 2 adults and 2 teenagers (have stayed in some small rooms in the US). Location is great for a base in Manhattan - away from the craziness| but quick and easy to get anywhere with plenty of subway stops within walking distance. All staff were friendly and and helpful.We would certainly stay here again.,Jul 6| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004

Everything was great except turn down service which never happened.  I asked the maid to come back in an hour and she never came.  I left the hotel and returned mid afternoon and was informed they had left and was only offered clean towels. Was pretty upset about that.

Valet parking is a joke and extremely careless. In a rush we didn’t do a walk thru of our van. Only to notice and hr later as we tried to open the passenger sliding door that there was a dent| scratches and wouldn’t fully open. We worked so hard to take good care of our car only to have a careless stranger damage it.  It was definitely while they had our vehicle! Terrible end to our vacation! PLEASE triple check your vehicle before leaving. Never again will we do valet parking anywhere. Hilton needs to do better!

Great deal for a centrally located Manhattan option. My business was in Brooklyn| which made the Financial District address really perfect: Downtown Brooklyn was less than 30 minutes away via train.

The rooms were small. Parking was not quoted at the right price| and they failed to tell you that you need to have your parking ticket stamped by the hotel to get the "hotel" rate for parking.  Parking was never told to be on a daily rate but said it was $40. No one mentioned that it was a day rate and not a flat rate.,Apr 7| 2019,3,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
It was close to Staten island ferry.............       ...................,Apr 5| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
I liked how close it was to the metro. And to the ferry.I didn't like that we never received clean sheets in the 4 nights we stayed. The fan in the bathroom was broken. And when they changed our towels we didn't receive washcloths. I called the front desk the first time. I didn't receive them for anther 2 hours they brought us hand towels instead of wash cloths. I was told I couldn't get a wash cloth for another 4 hours.  The next time they changed the towels I saw the house keeping in the elevator and told them I need wash cloths. Another couple in the elevator told house keeping they had not received any towels at all. We came in very late and found hand towels instead of wash cloths. I didn't call front desk because we were tired and had to leave at 5 am for the plane. Very disappointed. The manager used the excuse that house keeping had trouble with English and communication. Training is needed on how to put the bathroom together and maybe test them. I usually stay at La Quinta or Comfort Inn. Where breakfast is included and have no issues with house keeping. I thought Hilton was as good as these girls but I was filled and will be going back to the tried and true. Very disappointed.,Apr 3| 2019,2,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
Loved the location| near ferries| and great pubs (Dead Rabbit and Lovelace) and one block to metro station.  Room was bigger than most in NYC and very newly decorated.  Only complaint is that the shower faucet moved from hot to cold constantly.  .,Apr 2| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
I didn't feel safe so close to the elevator.  It was right across the hall and the deadbolt didn't work.  Also| it seemed that minority guests were relegated to certain floors.  Noticed as people entered and left the elevator.  Also|  I didn't appreciate the $50 additional hold on my credit card.,Apr 2| 2019,3,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004

Great deal for a centrally located Manhattan option. My business was in Brooklyn| which made the Financial District address really perfect: Downtown Brooklyn was less than 30 minutes away via train.

The hotel is pleasant looking and clean. The room was small and they view was nonexistant but all in all it was ok. One easy change they can make to improve stay is get normal size coffee cups for the coffee in the lobby. They were so small LOL. I liked the fruit water in the evenings. I liked that I could walk to restaurants and a drug store.

One easy change they can make to improve stay is get normal size coffee cups for the coffee in the lobby. They were so small LOL. I liked the fruit water in the evenings. I liked that I could walk to restaurants and a drug store. It was cool to be across from the Staten Island Ferry.,Jan 3| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004

Excellent rooms which were spacious and great value for money. Hotel itself was amazing. Only failing was a big one- my friend left behind her passport which the hotel found upon checkout but didn’t notify us when we came to collect our bags in the evening or even call/contact us.

The hotel was great. Staff was courteous and very helpful. The location is great. Easy access to subway and the Staten Island Ferry.  My only complaint is that on the morning of the NYC Marathon| my daughter as well as a few other runners went for a quick bite to eat before the race. Being that you cannot eat much prior to running a marathon| my daughter ate one piece of toast with peanut butter with a glass of water. That piece of toast cost her $35. Why she had to pay for a full continental breakfast is beyond me. It would have been nice had they run a special for whatever marathon runners staying with them to have a quick alternative to the $35 option. It would have made all the difference to us| having booked two rooms solely to support her and the other runners.,Nov 6| 2018,4,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004

This was the nicest| spacious and cleanest hotel that I’ve ever stayed at in NYC. I’m not sure when it was built| but the hotel is modern and looks brand new. The staff is friendly and greeted us each time we walked passed the front desk. It’s in the Financial District| so in the evenings it’s a little quieter than hotels in midtown. Plus| there’s no resort fee like some of the hotels in midtown. We also had a view of the Staten Island Ferry Station and water| which was a pleasant surprise. I will definitely be back and recommend this hotel - you won’t be disappointed. I didn’t take pics of the room| but what you see online is accurate. There’s also a fridge and microwave in the room.,Oct 14| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004

The hotel was very nice.  Across the street from the subway station at Battery Park and walking distance to the World Trade Center|  We arrived late but were able to get a meal at the restaurant.

The lady on duty when we checked in was a Star (Sorry cannot remember her name) otherwise the rest were rude and not helpful. Had to wait for ages to talk to them as only one person at a time was on duty attending to many guests at once and being constantly interrupted by phone calls. Waited for ages for the lift which being located on the 25yh floor was irritating. Will not stay here again as it is over priced for what you get.,Oct 9| 2018,3,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004

Overall the hotel was modern| clean and comfortable.  PROS- Easy access to the 4 and 5 station at bowling green| battery park| and south st sea port. CONS- hotel offered us to reserve a car to the airport| and did not tell us the correct price| and upon arrival to LGA| the driver asked for more money than we were informed of. We called the desk and all he could offer was an apology. This was the same person who placed 4 bottles of water on our room from the pantry| and then gave the hotel guests next to us the water for no charge. Also| we came back to our room at 4pm| and the housekeeping staff was tiding up. She placed new towels in our room| which were hard| and one of them stained. Also| the fitted sheet didn't stay on the bed| which was a little frustrating.,Sep 30| 2018,3,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
Room was great! On the last night of our stay the room next to us was having a VERY loud argument. We eventually called down to the front desk as it sounded like a man was punching walls/throwing things. The front desk didn’t seem to care as random screaming would continue through the rest of the night.,Sep 29| 2018,4,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004

The property was nice. The staff was friendly and the room was clean. The rooms are big compact for my taste,Sep 25| 2018,4,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The location was super convenient and the folks at the front desk were all very nice during my stay. I showed up a bit early for check-in| so my room wasn't ready. However the guy helping me was able to get me into another room instead of having me wait. The room had a view of the Staten Island Ferry terminal and was actually a complimentary upgrade! They have 3 very smooth high speed elevators to get you where you need to go.Everything in the room was nice and clean including the sheets and towels. Most importantly the bed was very comfortable. The room also came with a mini fridge. The shower had great water pressure.There were plenty of dining options to choose from all within walking distance. This is a great location if you plan on visiting the 9/11 memorial site| the Statue of Liberty| Ellis Island| etc. So if you need to be in the financial district for any reason| I would recommend this hotel as a great place to stay.,Sep 25| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004

This will be our go-to hotel in the Battery Park area. We come to NY once a week for work and this hotel is a quick cab or train ride to anywhere in the city you want to go. It is also very close to Brooklyn. We walked to the World Trade Center memorial site| Wall Street area| and saw lots of great restaurants along the way. I highly recommend it.,Aug 8| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004

The room was comfortable and the location is perfect. Steps to Battery Park and the waterfront| tons of delicious food and drinks nearby. Staff were friendly and helpful - although just one small thing I had requested (silverware delivered to the room so I could set up a surprise birthday cake for my boyfriend) I was told to go downstairs to the restaurant to find someone to ask for it. I was fully capable of doing that| it just would have been nice to have the little luxury of having it delivered to the room. They may have been busy and I understand.

The Hilton Garden Inn downtown is not aiming for luxury travelers| but provides what you need when traveling downtown. The rooms are consistent with what you'll find in other New York properties as far as size| but are clean and quiet with a helpful| friendly staff.

The hotel is really new| but there are some down sides of it as well. First night when we stayed there| there's construction on the street where we can hear the beeping sound of the construction vehicle at night (we stayed on 4th floor). Second night when we come back to the hotel| they didn't clean our room| so we just made an extra effort to call the front desk every morning to let them know the room is ready for service before we leave the room. The air coming out from the AC smells like ammonia| so we spray some perfume over it. The next night it smells fine again| not sure what happened there. Overall| we had a fair experience staying there.,Jul 6| 2018,3,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
The location of this Hilton Garden Inn is excellent for experiencing all of the attractions in the downtown area. Almost all of the sightseeing attractions are within comfortable walking distance. Everyone was move and the hotel was great. The best thing was the people. Staff was extremely helpful and went out of their way to answer our questions and assist us in any way they could. They were friendly and welcoming. Our room was spacious and very clean. I would highly recommend this hotel.,Jul 5| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004

Awesome location next to the Staten Island Ferry and Battery Park on the southern tip of Manhattan. The hotel is brand new| the staff is very courteous and eager to help. Breakfast on site is a bit steep at $24 considering that there are plenty of convenience stores and breakfast/food stores right around the corner. Rooms don’t have much space to store your luggage. Nice view from our room. Bed was very cozy. Keurig coffee machines and hair dryers in every room.

I always have an amazing time when I go to the Hilton this is one of my favorite ones in New York it has a great view the very top build it and they always give me the top floor only thing I would change I wish the room service was open aLittle longer between the times of 11 to 5 and later in the night at least about 12 other than that everything is perfect,Apr 1| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004

It was an absolutely beautiful hotel. Close to Wall Street| the Stock Exchange and the Staten Island ferry. I will be back!!,Mar 16| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
The location was right across the street from the Staten Island Ferry and right around the corner from Statue of Liberty and financial district(Wall St.). There wasn’t a whole lot of restaurants around or shopping areas around. The actual hotel was very clean. The rooms were kind of small but very comfortable. The hotel staff during the day was rude but I spoke with a manager who fixed my situation. This was my first time staying at Hilton hotel. Overall| the experience was pleasant| most likely would stay again.,Mar 15| 2018,4,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004

Der Aufenthalt im Hilton Garden Inn war für sehr angenehm.Abseits des Großstadttrubels im Financial District ist man trotzdem sehr schnell an seinen Zielen. Es gibt im Umkreis 3 verschiedene MTA Stationen (mit verschiedenen Linien) die Fussläufig innerhalb von 2-3min ereichbar sind. Ebenso ist das Staten Island Ferry Terminal in 2min und die Fähre zum Liberty Island in 4 min erreichbar.Leider ist der Housekeeping service nicht englisch sprechend| so das| obwohl man im Zimmer anwesend ist und eine entsprechende Info gibt| die Tür geöffnet wird. Zudem sind die Reinigungszeiten sehr unterschiedlich. Mal um 10am dann mal um 3pm. Ansonsten kann man bis 10am Kostenlosen Kaffee und Tee in der Lobby bekommen. unter der Woche sind rund um das Hotel verkaufstände angesiedelt| wo man sehr günstig Muffins| Bosten Creams und andere Süsswaren kaufen kann. Für einen weiteren Besuch in NYC würde ich das Hotel auf jeden Fall wieder in Betracht ziehen. Bei Buchung "mit Aussicht" hat man einen guten Blick auf das Wasser.

As such I had a pleasant stay at the Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown hotel. Service was good and professional and the hotel was generally in good condition. Breakfast is 17/23 dollars per person (continental/full) so I skipped that. There is a small gym in the basement which I used on two occasions| a typical hotel gym.The beds are quite hard and not really suitable for lightweight people (I'm 5 ft 11 in and 150 lbs).The wifi worked alright.The hotel is located at Battery Park so there is easy access to the subway (both the red| yellow and green line serves stations nearby the hotel) and the ferry to Staten Island.My only real complaint about this hotel was the level of noise inside the room. I was in a room on the 20th floor at the back of the hotel ("city view" they call it) and the level of noise coming from the outside was quite high. No soundproofing what so ever has been installed so beware if you are sensible to noise or a light sleeper. Furthermore| the refrigerator in the room was quite audible when the compressor was on. I alerted the front desk to this| but nothing was done about it during my stay.Would I come back: Not unless they install soundproofing in all the rooms.,Jul 13| 2019,3,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004

Das Hotel ist gut gelegen in lower manhattan| direkt neben battery park und dem Fährterminal. Alle Sehenswürdigkeiten in downtown sind gut zu fuß zu erlaufen (Wall Street| WTC| chinatown| soho. Der Service war auch sehr freu dlich und zuvorkommend. Check in war innerhalb von 5 min getan| luggage storage nach dem checkout war kein problem und die Zimmer waren amerikanisch gut ausgestattet. Das Hotel kann auf jeden Fall noch nicht sehr alt sein da es inneinem wirklich guten Zustand war für amerikanische Verhältnisse.,Nov 5| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004

Good location| rooms are clean and nice. I recommend,Nov 28| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
Hotel wirkt noch sehr neu| Bett sehr bequem und Lage fantastisch! Allerdings ließ sich leider die Lüftung nicht abschalten| so dass es entweder zu warm oder zu kalt war. Schade auch (für die Umwelt)| dass die Handtücher jeden Tag gewechselt werden obwohl dies nicht erforderlich wäre. Insgesamt absolut zu empfehlen!,Nov 27| 2018,4,Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown,6 Water St| New York| NY| 10004
