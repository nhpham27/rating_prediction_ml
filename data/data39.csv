Great central location adjacent to many eateries. Homeless population is abundant in the area. There is security at the entrance as an added safety feature. The rooms are extremely small abs a very tight squeeze for a family of four. Nice gym.,Aug 20| 2021,4,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102
Very slow to check in and then room was filthy.  Was moved to a new room but it was also not all that clean.   Bedding had holes in it| dust all over.  I realize because of Covid the hotel and service industry is short staffed but it doesn’t sit well to pay so much for a room that isn’t even clean.,Aug 19| 2021,2,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102
Housekeeping was horrible.  They walked into our room at 8:15a.m. while we were still sleeping.  They came back again at 10:10a.m. and yet again at 10:50a.m.  Horrible!!!  I parked my 2019 truck using valet and when I got it back they gave it to me with a scrape down the entire driver's side from the driver door to the taillight of my truck.  The line to register took forever!!!!!  Too many people and not enough service.  The bar at the top of the hotel was amazing.  Great views and great service!,Aug 16| 2021,1,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102
Staff was very quick to fix the AC in our room when it was not working.,Aug 16| 2021,4,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

Likes - The view from the City Scape bar on the 46th floor. The staff and facilities themselves were also fantastic. Dislikes - Despite being on the 10th floor I was woken up 6-8 times during the night due to various noises. I am not a light sleeper. The noises included our neighbors across the hall| cars blaring music| staff working in the maintenance elevator| and what sounded like an World War II air raid siren at 2:00am. I will definitely be booking a room higher in the towers and on the interior of the building if I stay here again. As a note| the other friends who were staying at this same hotel did not experience the noise we did| but were higher and on the inside of the property (pool view). The homeless situation in the part of town is also concerning.,Aug 15| 2021,3,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

The property was clean and the service was good. The issue I have is that I paid significantly extra for more floor space (upgrading to the deluxe) but I don’t feel there was any extra floor space. I paid the money but didn’t get it. We received a regular size room. Which was quite inconvenient considering I paid a lot for the extra floor space. Grrrrr,Aug 10| 2021,3,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102
Had a good stay | parking is pricey but overall good environment,Aug 9| 2021,5,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

Hotel itself is very clean and sanitary. However| the area it is in is not the best. As soon as you step outside the lobby it makes you feel unsafe. The hotel had no room service. Very limited dining| small bakery/mini mart. Parking was not free.,Aug 9| 2021,4,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

I like the balcony| it was gorgeous!The cold water faucet in our room did not work. I called the plumber person via main lobby around 1am| he was not able to resolve the issue because he did not have the proper tools| so just provided us with bottle of water for cold water replacement.,Aug 6| 2021,3,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

Clean and super comfortable,Aug 1| 2021,5,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102
There is very limited personnel al the front desk| only one person. Our room looked very old| small and not so clean| perhaps due to how old the room looked like.,Aug 1| 2021,2,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102
The room was not sanitized or as clean as advertised.  There was body hair in the tub| a left over wash cloth from the last customer and the provided fridge is small and not any colder than the room. The hallway carpets are filthy| at least on the 7th floor.  The staff was incredibly nice and the other amenities seemed to be in working order.,Aug 1| 2021,4,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102
I like that they had security there at all times to make sure that nobody got into the hotel that didn’t belong you have to show your room key when you enter every single time. I did not like the fact that they did not have a sit down restaurant they only had a grab and go with the grab and go options were great for people that were looking for that.,Jul 31| 2021,5,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

The hotel was okay in general and the room was clean. My only complaint is that the tower we stayed in had a terrible echo and the doors closed abruptly. Every door that closed on our floor sounded like the door was in our room. This made sleeping extremely difficult.,Jul 27| 2021,3,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102
The lobby was great.  The check in was smooth.  And the room was clean.  Downfalls was there were no on site parking available and suggested close locations were sketchy to enter with children. There was no microwave in the room| so leftovers are obsolete.  The bathroom doors are translucent so the late shines through.  The only mirror outside the bathroom is on the closet door so when the bathroom light is on| the room is very bright. So hard to use the restroom at night.  Then| speak location.  On checkout my minds and I were approached for change and cigarettes.  Kids were scared.,Jul 27| 2021,2,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

I booked a standard room.  I was told at check-in that they upgraded my room - which sounded nice.  But if the room they gave me was an upgrade| I'd hate to see what a standard would have been.  The room was dark.  The bathroom was tiny (the toilet was actually in front of half of the miniature vanity (which was only about 12" deep).  And the tiny sink was too small to even wash my face.  The water pressure in the shower was so low that there wasn't enough force to make water flow on some of the settings on the shower head.None of this is what I would expect from a Hilton.  There are plenty of much cheaper options in San Francisco if one wants a dark room with a tiny| sub-standard bathroom.,Jun 14| 2021,2,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

The room was great| but the Staff/process at security is TERRIBLE. Arriving at the HILTON Hotel| I felt like I was arriving in a concentration camp or something| as you need to prove yourself every time you think to go out of the main entrance| even for 2 minutes. You need to show who you are| even answer questions to the security like: "What are you doing here?" What? Do I need to justify the reason for my trip? (As a side note| after I questioned this process they placed a bigger security guy on my side trying to put some fear on me| so I loved and pushed more to talk to the manager and asked to call the police. )TREAT CUSTOMERS WITH FEAR? NOT ACCEPTABLE!!!Also| the SECURITY IS HANDLING SENSITIVE INFORMATION IN A BUNCH OF PAPER SHEETS| like my and wife's full name (First and Last) and more details that I could not check. My question is:  "With this sensitive information| WHO GUARANTEES that this info will de destroy after the workday? Or even if will not go to "bad" hands that could do some identity theft?If Hilton wants good security| should invest in an automated system that can validate identity in a secure manner and avoid any identity theft.

First of all- charging $58/night for self parking is completely out of the norm. Second| guests have to wait >20 mins to check in on a Saturday afternoon. Asked the receptionist and she said that’s the norm. She even said don’t stay in this location at all cost.

Took us about 25 minutes waiting in line to just check in. When we checked in| we went to our room and noticed that they put us in a room with one full size bed when I paid for a king size bed. I then called down to the front desk and the person who answered said that they were supposed to tell me that they were SOLD OUT of King size beds (what I paid extra for). The person who checked us in was the GENERAL MANAGER. She then said that she can put us in a king size bed for the next night (we stayed 2 nights) and offer complimentary breakfast for our inconvenience. Moral of the story| don’t stay here on a holiday.

Walls were paper thin| felt like the screaming toddlers nextdoor were in my room (all night).  You can hear all activity in the hallway including every door opening and closing. Slept terrible. Neighbor was convinced my room was theirs| probably because the concierge wrote my room number on their key.  That made for a tense and avoidable exchange.No microwave| which I found weird.  No bathtub.  Nothing to stir your coffee with.Late checkout not available| but the option of a luggage check was provided.  This was great| until I watched as the frustrated employees/attendents kicked the luggage accross the floor.  Upon return to pick up my bag I reached for my bag which the attendendant dropped onto the floor instead (cringeworthy moment for my laptop).

Everything in the hotel was very good we had a great time and the concierge down at the desk I believe his name was I think it was meant well but I’m not positive he was very very helpful I booked a He booked a shuttle service for us when we left the hotel he was extremely helpful. Nothing but good things to say about the hotel in general I had an excellent stay in the room was very clean and well equipped. Would be happy to stay there again.

Walls were paper thin| felt like the screaming toddlers nextdoor were in my room (all night).  You can hear all activity in the hallway including every door opening and closing. Slept terrible. Neighbor was convinced my room was theirs| probably because the concierge wrote my room number on their key.  That made for a tense and avoidable exchange.No microwave| which I found weird.  No bathtub.  Nothing to stir your coffee with.Late checkout not available| but the option of a luggage check was provided.  This was great| until I watched as the frustrated employees/attendents kicked the luggage accross the floor.  Upon return to pick up my bag I reached for my bag which the attendendant dropped onto the floor instead (cringeworthy moment for my laptop). The food shop/cafe were really great| the lobby is beautiful.  The rooms are exceedingly clean.,Jan 13| 2020,2,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

the staff was not friendly not sure if because I am of a  different ethnicity.The TV channels are not diversed. The weather was raining and we couldn't go sightseeing so we had to rely on television for entertainment. The hotel knew that there was an issue with the TV Guide versus what was showing on the screen and they never informed the quest. When we complained then the front desk said we know about the tv guide mix up but it's wasn't corrected while I was there when I left four days later the same concern was not corrected. More diversity channels needed . No own not MtV  Vh1. No entertainment so we couldn't really enjoy the stay because the weather was raining and one day it was torrential rains,Dec 9| 2019,3,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

The hotel knew that there was an issue with the TV Guide versus what was showing on the screen and they never informed the quest. When we complained then the front desk said we know about the tv guide mix up but it's wasn't corrected while I was there when I left four days later the same concern was not corrected. More diversity channels needed . No own not MtV  Vh1. No entertainment so we couldn't really enjoy the stay because the weather was raining and one day it was torrential rains,Dec 9| 2019,3,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

Location is great and the room was lovely!   However| the lobby is so noisy now especially with the bar and the shop| it feels like you're in a railway station.  But once away from the madding crowds it's a little quieter!,Nov 24| 2019,4,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102
Great location very close to Union Square| a lot of homeless in one side of the area and sometimes they hang around close to the hotel. The room was small but comfortable| check in and check out was quick and convenient. Only thing is that is not a quiet hotel | the massive lobby is super loud  | a lot of people up and down of elevators and it can get a bit uncomfortable. If your looking for with a relaxing environment | this is not for you. a plus | the bar upstairs its awesome with great views of the city !,Nov 23| 2019,4,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102
Lobby bar was a standout when first entering the hotel. The acoustics are not good| as a large conference was just kicking off and checking in was more like going to a stadium than a Hilton hotel.

This is the largest hotel on the west coast. It’s HUGE and can feel a bit overwhelming. We had 3 separate rooms| all small frankly. But you’re sleeping| so how much room do you really need? What sets major hotels apart is their customer service. Here| the cleaning staff went above and beyond to speak to me anytime I was in the corridor. They asked what room I was in and if I needed anything. The cleaning crew and food service crews impressed me the most. They had relaxed efficiency and expressed genuine care. Anytime I went to the front desk| concierge| and doormen| I was interrupting a coworker conversation. My sister had a stroller with her and I got the doors every time. Now I can open my own door!! But we had our arms full and an assist would have been nice. The elevators are fast and I appreciated the filtered water available for dispensal.

Way too expensive. $200 to park for 3 days. No room service. Lobby food market outrageously expensive. $15 for a small bowl of salad| cup of fruit around $10| (maybe $8.50).

Good hotel in a great location. And Hilton beds are always very comfortable. However| the walls of the rooms are thin| so noise is usually an issue when I stay here. I have learned to bring ear plugs in order to get a decent  night’s sleep here.

It may as well have been called Union Station - absolutely the most crowded hotel I have ever stayed at and the front desk staff are among the most ignorant and rude I have ever witnessed.

Good hotel in a great location. And Hilton beds are always very comfortable. However| the walls of the rooms are thin| so noise is usually an issue when I stay here. I have learned to bring ear plugs in order to get a decent  night’s sleep here.

Horrible check in experience. Arrived around noon & was told I could “check in” & they would text me when my room was ready. By almost 5pm my room was STILL not ready.

Not worth the price and also not up to the standard one would expect from a Hilton.  Rooms were small| dated and dingy.  Didn’t feel family friendly-more suitable to party goers.

We had a great time at this hotel.  It's close to all the shopping and fun downtown. The hotel itself is energetic! Lobby is always busy with a place to sit and eat and have drinks.  The cafe in hotel has everything you need.  We had an issue with our room smelling like smoke when we first arrived and they upgraded our room.  Our room was fairly quiet in tower 3 with the odd person walking down the hall late at night but nothing too annoying.

Not located close to union square as advertised| very close to the homeless shelters and to the streets where they sleep did not feel safe at any time of the day.

Very slow moving line and skipped me to attend a Hilton Honors member guest even though I am also a member (and was only checking out) but did not get in that line because there was only one person helping HH members.

I travel a lot for work and am happy to say this Hilton exceeded my expectations.  I knew the views would be good as it's somewhat isolated from other tall buildings| but they just didn't end.  Super happy with everything I saw and of course| the Cityscape Lounge on the top (46th) floor was incredible.  The only negative thing was that there was no parking left when I checked in and had to park in a dodgy garage across the street.

Stayed 2 nights with husband and 2 teens.  It was definitely geared toward business people and seriously| DONT go west or south 1 street because the area changes considerable and is unsafe.  Staff was great and rooms were clean.  Pool is pretty lame and goes unused.  I would stay more centrally in Union Square if we visited again.  There were other hotels closer to everything which probably have what we needed.  We walked back at night twice and literally walked 1 block too far and even though we're from Philadelphia| I felt really unsafe with my kids.  Lots of homeless people in the city in general (no big deal| used to that and no one really bothers you).  But the distinct difference if you head on Van Ness or Mason is incredible.  Just too sterile and business-oriented for families.

The room was quite small| but it was very clean| and the tablet to look up nearby things to do was nice. What I did NOT appreciate were all the hidden fees. $75 deposit for incidentals and $58/day for self-parking (with an additional $8 for taxes). I've been to Hiltons in San Diego right on the beach that only charge $35/day for parking. I'm appalled by $60. I chose Hilton because it was cheaper than Marriott| which I prefer| but with all the additional fees| I could have stayed at the Marriott for less.,Jul 14| 2019,4,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

1.  When we checked-in the front desk receptionist|       I felt was racist.  She did not give me the        welcome gift even though I am Hilton Honors       guest.  I know every time I stay at Embassy       Suites|  I always get the HH guest bag.  I saw a       cabinet full of gift bags| the same one they also          give out in Emb suites but y husband said just       don’t mind it so I did. I did mention it to the lady       anymore.        2.  The surrounding area was so filthy dirty.  I’d even say| if not for the many tourists|  it would be considered safety and health hazard.  There are sooo many homeless people.  Garbage all over.

Sorry in advance| where do I start? The pillows in our room were extremely uncomfortable to sleep on and we actually left with neck problems. But we're back home now and feeling better after 1 night. The cleaning crew cleaned our room but didn't fluff our sheets| which still had some sand particles in it from our beach trip. They didn't restock us with towels and our shampoos & conditioners weren't refilled. So disappointing :( we were also situated in a room with no tub| I guess I could have asked for a room with a tub but you'd think the reservation info would have that bit covered considering a toddler was included in the booking details. Our boy had to literally sit on the concrete shower to play in the water those 4 nights we stayed. At least he was happy :) The food menus were not versatile and on top of that| overpriced. If we visit the city again we'll definitely be looking to stay at a different hotel. The only thing I appreciated really was that we were on the same floor as the pool.,Jul 8| 2019,2,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

This is the second time in two years that we have stayed here.  Both times the service at reception was incredibly slow.  It was blamed on slow computers both times.  I found a lot of talking between the attendants (maybe due to the slow connections?)   Both times were at busy times and there seemed that there were not enough reception people available.   The room was fine though for the price and being a Hilton Honors member| I was a little surprised at getting a room facing a wall for the outside view.

The hotel is what one would expect from Hilton.  Good service but you pay for everything.  No morning coffee in the lobby here!  Our bathroom was exceedingly small and the shower did not drain very well.  That was disappointing.  Their promotional material does not mention having to pay for wi-fi in the room.  Other hotels say something like "free wi-fi in the lobby|" or words to that affect so that the customer will have at least a hint that there is a cost for room wi-fi.  As for the rest of our experience|it was as one can expect from a Hilton in San Francisco.,Apr 17| 2019,2,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102
We were supposed to have a mobility/hearing access tub and did not receive that. We also walked into the bedroom and there was a plastic bag over the fire alarm. We were on the 9th floor. If a fire were to start we would not have a clue. Check out time was before noon and we had the cleaning service come to our door multiple times after telling them we were not leaving until check out starting at 7:30 am. Very unpleased with this stay and hotel service.,Apr 17| 2019,2,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

The hotel is what one would expect from Hilton.  Good service but you pay for everything.  No morning coffee in the lobby here!  Our bathroom was exceedingly small and the shower did not drain very well.  That was disappointing.  Their promotional material does not mention having to pay for wi-fi in the room.  Other hotels say something like "free wi-fi in the lobby|" or words to that affect so that the customer will have at least a hint that there is a cost for room wi-fi.  As for the rest of our experience|it was as one can expect from a Hilton in San Francisco.,Apr 17| 2019,2,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102
We were supposed to have a mobility/hearing access tub and did not receive that. We also walked into the bedroom and there was a plastic bag over the fire alarm. We were on the 9th floor. If a fire were to start we would not have a clue. Check out time was before noon and we had the cleaning service come to our door multiple times after telling them we were not leaving until check out starting at 7:30 am. Very unpleased with this stay and hotel service.,Apr 17| 2019,2,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

It WAS done on Friday| but really| how many times do you have to ask for old food to be cleaned off the walls before it is| I can tell you| 4 times. Oh| if you use the coffee machine in the room| don't expect the maid to refresh the things you use| like the stirring sticks and creamer pots. Nearly $600 a night| this is very very poor indeed. Very poor. My 8 years of staying here is at an end. Rubbish.

Hotel is fabulous. Loved the hotel itself. However| the location gave me mixed feelings. Proximity to Union Sq is a huge plus especially for shoppers| but it is also almost next to tenderloin and Mission St. Just need to be careful where you wonder.,Jan 24| 2019,4,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

I think I expected more from the Hilton. Towels were like cardboard| old and overused one even with a hole. Bathroom counter was dirty as if nothing is really moved but rather cleaned around. The bar lobby is INSANELY loud and was ALWAYS extremely crowded. At one point a waiter put through a drink order from one in our group that clearly was not thinking straight. We asked it to be cancelled and they wouldn’t. Very unethical to take a drink order from someone too intoxicated to know better.,Jan 22| 2019,3,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

Was welcomed by a staff member clearly not enjoying her role. That set the tone for the rest of the stay. After making one local phone call at a cost of $1.50 I was charged another $150 dollars on top of my $250 original holding security deposit!!

Very unhelpful staff.  Not allowed to use pool or gym the day you check out.  We got in late the night before so never were allowed to use the facilities.  The hotel costs way more than other hotels and then they nickel and dime you so the bill is way higher than even that. $65 plus to park$25 per hour for late check out,Jan 2| 2019,1,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102
The hotel is great| and reasonably priced; especially for the location. I've stayed there many times. Wound up with a bit of a smaller room than usual this time around.

Made us feel so welcome. The front deak staff were extremely polite offering upgrades to our room and an ice skating ticket promotion I couldn't help take advantage of.

The location could not have been better for us; in a safe neighborhood and convenient to everything we wanted. The hotel was clean| contemporary and well maintained with fabulous staff and great amenities. The room was scrupulously clean and so comfortable. We had a room with a spectacular view and balcony. Convenient and reasonably priced parking. We came for an overnight stay to take in the city Christmas vibe and had the best time.,Dec 25| 2018,5,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102
What was otherwise an acceptable stay was marred at the very last minute by a rude front of house staff at the registration counter. Seeing as to how the queue for the regular checkin counter was extremely long| I made the decision to join the Hilton Honors queue to CHECK OUT. Literally a 15-second “here’re the keys goodbye” operation. Got sarcastically chided by the female staff in red that I should join the regular queue and didn’t even acknowledge if the checkout process was done. A hideous way to end the trip.

Hire was good for the price| but $70+ for parking seems to be excessive| but may be normal for that congested area,Dec 26| 2018,5,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102
We booked 2 months in advance for a family of 4 but we got one bed room. We could not sleep well.,Dec 25| 2018,3,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102
The location could not have been better for us; in a safe neighborhood and convenient to everything we wanted. The hotel was clean| contemporary and well maintained with fabulous staff and great amenities. The room was scrupulously clean and so comfortable. We had a room with a spectacular view and balcony. Convenient and reasonably priced parking. We came for an overnight stay to take in the city Christmas vibe and had the best time.,Dec 25| 2018,5,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102
What was otherwise an acceptable stay was marred at the very last minute by a rude front of house staff at the registration counter. Seeing as to how the queue for the regular checkin counter was extremely long| I made the decision to join the Hilton Honors queue to CHECK OUT. Literally a 15-second “here’re the keys goodbye” operation. Got sarcastically chided by the female staff in red that I should join the regular queue and didn’t even acknowledge if the checkout process was done. A hideous way to end the trip. MAKE IT RIGHT AND HAVE MORE THOUGHT AND FLEXIBILITY FOR YOUR GUESTS!,Dec 25| 2018,2,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

When your closet is bigger than your bathroom| you know your hotel is in need of a redo. We rented a 1 bedroom suite | which was difficult to find in the city| but decided on Hilton because of its well known brand. Upon walking in| the room was good size| couch| table and good sized bedroom.   I was told would have a hide a bed in the living room| but it wasn’t. We had to order a roll away. The only bathroom in the room was in the bedroom area. It was SO SMALL. The shower was old| the door was like a linen closet door| not even big enough for a regular door. The closet was unnecessarily large. They only left 2 towels to use. No mini bar! In a suite? Come on!  This was way below average experience and hotel. You’re better off renting two rooms at a nicer hotel.,Dec 22| 2018,1,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102
I booked this stay on Orbitz.  When I checked in they told me I had two reservations.  It took some time to sort out and should not have happened.  I booked two nights and that should have been one reservation| not two.  Not sure where things fell apart| but please fix this.,Dec 21| 2018,5,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102
Very impressed with the hotel. Rooms were nice and bed very comfortable.  Check in was quick and the guy that helped us was very helpful plus was able to change the bed from 1 bed to two plus put our group together in the same tower plus floor!! The little store in the lobby was outrageously over price. The bar on the 46th floor has amazing views but waiter was totally overwhelmed.  Not the best waiter. Definitely would stay again!,Dec 21| 2018,5,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

The hotel was nice and the very clean| staff was friendly enough| and the rooftop bar was beautiful. There’s no room service which I found a bit illogical| the area around is fine during daylight but after dark I was very a bit on edge.  Tenderloin district isn’t far| steer clear of that. Room was nice| elevators are super quick for a hotel of this size. The market grab n go in the lobby is convenient| expensive| but of good quality. Overall| as I was traveling on business it was fine| if I was on holiday I would probably go somewhere a bit nicer with room service and less sketchy people outside.,Dec 18| 2018,3,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

Booked a room with 2 queen beds for 8 nights. While the view is not fantastic from my room (facing a garage)| we are really happy with it as it was comfortable and nicely stocked with Crabtree toiletries & coffee bean coffee & tea bags daily. While the booking didn't seem to include wifi when I booked| I was pleasantly surprised to get wifi codes to use (very good connectivity)! There is an outdoor heated pool too. Hotel has water stations for you to fill up with your own bottle| which was a nice green touch. fast liftsWhile the hotel is just beside the Tenderloin area| I feel safe as the hotel was large and busy and you have bellboys at the door all the time. There are homeless people around the hotel but they were generally harmless and sometimes just wanted some warm food or drinks or change. If you don't have| they won't bother you either. The room can be pricey nearing your travel dates so do consider booking early.,Dec 18| 2018,5,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

I had paid for a deluxe King room with a view and got a very small room with no view to the city. The staff member advised us it was 40.00 per night to upgrade and could not give us a room because I had purchased it thru a 3rd party website. Our family members stayed at the same hotel with a standard double room got there later that evening and got a free upgrade to a junior suite with a city view for free.

Good: 1-Property is in great location 2- Rooms were spacious and clean 3 staff was friendly and supportive Bad: 1- Booked the room 2 months in advance requesting one king size bed.  Hotel initially said they could not guarantee offer through Expedia until the matter was escalated to manager and approval was granted 3- room was across a rental car parking lot with flood lights pointed directly into room- window screen did not block it out. No blackout curtains so bring your eye covers that the airlines usually supply because the whole room was lit up. 4-Pillows should be replaced by the ones Marriot uses. 5- hallways need to be updated- worn and aged.  Hotels are aging in this area including Hyatt and they’re just not keeping the properties up in nice condition. 5- too many aggressive hookers outside of lobby area on Saturday evening. 6- visited rooftop bar on early Friday evening and the bar was out of two significant appetizers on a very limited menu. The vegetable platter didn’t look fresh at all and appeared to be dry and defrosted- we turned it back. The appetizer menu needs work- disappointing for a place with a great view - would have stayed longer and drank longer. if there was something decent to snack on.,Dec 10| 2018,4,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

Hotel made an unauthorized charge in my bill related to Lobby Bar| which I observed during checkout.  I never used the Lobby Bar at all. On request to verify and revert| the staff could not verify it at that time or could not show me the particular receipt| even after repeat requests. The hotel charged the amount to the payment through credit card.  This is really unprofessional and a type of cheating.  Very bad from a brand like Hilton| especially when the staff says that they cannot show the particular receipt to the customer.,Dec 5| 2018,2,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102
Property was clean. Has some on site dining options. It is close by the cable car turn around and perishing square. Only thing i was unhappy with was the staff. Trued to check in a lil early and they trued to upsell me to room options besides what i paid for. When i declined I was told i would have to return at check in time because the room was not ready. When i returned at almost 4 pm when checkin is 3 i was tild room was still not available and the upsell was attempted once again.

Overall a good stay in the Hilton Union Square. Rooms dated but clean. Location ideal with Powell Station less than a 5 minute walk. Cityscape was fantastic for a drink whilst admiring the city during sunset. The small shop in the reception area was extremely overpriced so found one of the many Starbucks nearby. San Francisco has a real problem with homelessness. Reportedly over 7|000 which did not go unnoticed. Most on drugs which became comparable to a zombie apocalypse. Countless times we were approached by those begging for money| not just on the street| but whilst eating dinner| on public transport and even in shops. Police do not seem to care. Felt very unsafe to go out alone in the dark as a young women.,Dec 3| 2018,4,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

Hotel made an unauthorized charge in my bill related to Lobby Bar| which I observed during checkout.  I never used the Lobby Bar at all. On request to verify and revert| the staff could not verify it at that time or could not show me the particular receipt| even after repeat requests. The hotel charged the amount to the payment through credit card.  This is really unprofessional and a type of cheating.  Very bad from a brand like Hilton| especially when the staff says that they cannot show the particular receipt to the customer.,Dec 5| 2018,2,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102
Property was clean. Has some on site dining options. It is close by the cable car turn around and perishing square. Only thing i was unhappy with was the staff. Trued to check in a lil early and they trued to upsell me to room options besides what i paid for. When i declined I was told i would have to return at check in time because the room was not ready. When i returned at almost 4 pm when checkin is 3 i was tild room was still not available and the upsell was attempted once again. After saying no a second time all of a sudden a room similar to what i booked was ready.

Highrise in heart of Union Square. Everything you need/want nearby. In room coffee pretty good. Anything you want to eat within blocks. Clean| nice sheets and fluffy towels.

There is nothing special about this hotel.  I chose it for the location but there are better options.  I arrived at 2pm and was told guaranteed checkin is not until 3pm| but I could upgrade to a room that was ready for $40 per night. I declined.  Then I saw lots of people checking in a getting rooms so I got back on line at 2:40 and same clerk assigned me a room.  I asked why lots of other people could get rooms| and she said you could have checked again earlier.  Then my room was terrible (tiny| musty| yuck).  I called the operator and she held another room for me.  I went downstairs to get a new key (luckily I had different clerk| hooray!) and my new room was fine.  I would not recommend this hotel| many other options with better service.,Nov 26| 2018,3,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

Everything was great except that the cost of parking your car was $60.00 a night. A little expensive to say the least. I think if you are a hotel guest that you should get a better rate.

Some elevators go to certain floors while others do not. While the rate was lower than average for the hotel| we were placed in a small room| farthest from the elevators...it took at least 5 solid minutes of walking and elevator riding to exit. On cleanliness| the lotion and used tissues in the bedside drawer are a pretty clear (and gross) indication that the rooms are not being thoroughly cleaned.,Nov 13| 2018,3,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

I paid for a suite with a sitting area and the room didn’t have a sitting area and the it was next to the elevators and we didn’t get any sleep cuz of the noise.  The hotel moved us to another room which was a lot better| however it was still dirty from previous occupant.  They ended up cleaning it and offered us breakfast.  The last night was fine however the refrigerator died in the night and all of our food was spoiled.  We’ve stayed there a few times before and enjoyed it and this was my fiancé’s 40th bday weekend and it was a horrible experience.

if you pull the dresser away from its place against the wall| you will find years of boxed up dust. The breakfast here is great at poached.

Its only saving grace is the Jacuzzi| which by the way has so much foam and childs’ piss in it that it is still suspect.  If you are a guest who is showing up in planning to use the pool| I would suggest that the only way of getting them to clean it out with freshwater would be to bring some purple food dye with you.

The room felt a little cramped. Not much clearance between the end of the bed and the room furniture.Most awkward is the narrow lavatory sink front to back. I am a mechanical consulting engineer. I found this narrow sink extremely frustrating.Lastly| I found the length of piping between the control valve and the shower head annoying and a wasteful of water. The shower| controls and trim are defiantly attractive and novel. They are not water conservative. I know Hilton can do better on the next phase of remodel/modernization.,Sep 29| 2018,4,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102
The hotel is not in a good area| if you are travelling to SF on holiday I would not recommend staying here. It is in the tenderloin district. The hotel lobby was heaving with people all the time| at some points the queue for check in was 40 people long. We were given a room which was marketed as a “suite” but was actually part of a suite but with the adjoining doors locked. We slept on a camp bed and despite asking to be moved to the room we had booked we were told it was fully booked so we had to stay. The staff were unaccomodating and there was no soundproofing.

Very disappointed with our stay here for the price we paid ( around £240 a night) the rooms are big| but are very basic and decor is a bit miserable. wifi is around £10 a day on top which is ridiculous from a hotel of this callibre .shame as area is very central to everything.,Sep 25| 2018,3,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

The room felt a little cramped. Not much clearance between the end of the bed and the room furniture.Most awkward is the narrow lavatory sink front to back. I am a mechanical consulting engineer. I found this narrow sink extremely frustrating.Lastly| I found the length of piping between the control valve and the shower head annoying and a wasteful of water. The shower| controls and trim are defiantly attractive and novel. They are not water conservative. I know Hilton can do better on the next phase of remodel/modernization.,Sep 29| 2018,4,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102
The hotel is not in a good area| if you are travelling to SF on holiday I would not recommend staying here. It is in the tenderloin district. The hotel lobby was heaving with people all the time| at some points the queue for check in was 40 people long. We were given a room which was marketed as a “suite” but was actually part of a suite but with the adjoining doors locked. We slept on a camp bed and despite asking to be moved to the room we had booked we were told it was fully booked so we had to stay. The staff were unaccomodating and there was no soundproofing. The breakfast buffet was $39 or there was a v expensive hotel shop where you could buy yoghurt and granola for $10!,Sep 27| 2018,2,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

The hotel has everything you need on the premises - restaurants| room service| business center (great for printing out tour passes)| a convenience store... It’s location is also great. You’re within short walking distance of public transportation (Bart| cable cars and Muni). The Pinecrest Diner is open 24 hours a day and is a block away. The Big Bus tour company picks up folks on the Mason Street entrance of the hotel. Super convenient. Our only note is that the rooms have glass doors for the bathroom. They’re completely frosted so you can’t see in| but the light still comes through. So if you have to use the restroom in the middle of the night and switch on the light in the bathroom|  the bedroom fills with light| too. Not great for the person in be still trying to sleep.

É um hotel muito grande| fila de check in grande e é um pouco demorada. Hotel cobra 10 dólares  por encomenda recebida. O quarto é bom| porém muito pequeno. Estávamos um casal e uma criança de 4 anos. Na reserva constava cama queen| mas era de casal. Corredores bem longos dependendo do quarto que ficar. Mas tem 5 elevadores  e funcionam super bem. Localização excelente. Quarto silencioso| apesar do último dia da minha hospedagem ter feito muito baralho de obra .

部屋が最悪でした。1870という部屋。狭いのは我慢するとして、窓からの景色がひどい。1メートル先が壁で、窓と壁の間の空間にあるのは電気設備のような機器。その機器の上には吸い殻がいくつも落ちていた。ヒルトンの提供する景色はタバコの吸い殻なのです。陽光もほとんど入らない。そして夜中や明け方に突然聞こえる大きなボイラーのような音。30分～1時間くらい続く。安い料金で予約したからなのか？日本人だからバカにされたのか？これまで何回もヒルトンに宿泊したが、最悪でした。,Jan 14| 2020,1,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

El hotel es muy central . Grande y las habitaciones están bien para 4 personas en nuestro caso 2 adultos y 2 Niños.

地點好，但房間有異味，殘留上一位客人很重的古龍水味，房間很舊乾淨度差，入夜後門外有警察檢查，感覺較安全，職員服務很好，當我在大街上被人偷東西後提供了很好的協助，值得一讚，但性價比低，暫時不會推薦,Aug 7| 2019,3,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

너무 오래된 호텔이지만 좋은 위치였던것 같아요^^,Jul 27| 2019,4,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102
El hotel es muy central . Grande y las habitaciones están bien para 4 personas en nuestro caso 2 adultos y 2 Niños. Al inicio nuestra habitación era pequeña pero nos cambiaron a una más grande sin costo. No es un hotel lujoso pero está bien . Tiene un bar en la parte alta pero lamesera  no era la más amable . Nos colocaron una cuna gratis,Aug 7| 2019,4,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102
地點好，但房間有異味，殘留上一位客人很重的古龍水味，房間很舊乾淨度差，入夜後門外有警察檢查，感覺較安全，職員服務很好，當我在大街上被人偷東西後提供了很好的協助，值得一讚，但性價比低，暫時不會推薦,Aug 7| 2019,3,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102
위치는 괜찮았으나 조식당의 종류도 별로 없고| 방 사이즈도 너무 적고 호텔이 4성급인데도 불구하고 너무 어수선하고 힐튼이라는 브랜드 가치를 하지 못한것 같다. 힐튼 멤버였는데 포인트 적립도 안된다고 하고 다음에는 이 호텔을 이용하지 않을것이다,Aug 7| 2019,2,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

ワイナリーツアーの集合場所になっていたので選択しました。ホテル自体は清潔で安全なのですが、治安の悪い地区もそう遠くないところにあり、夜間の歩行には注意が必要です。ということで、23時過ぎにホテルのバーに入りましたが、週末ということもありとても混んでいました。ひとりで落ち着いて飲む雰囲気ではなかったです。部屋のアメニティーは不足するものが多く、歯磨き、バスローブ、スリッパを注文して届けて貰いました。朝食は30ドル程度でしたが、とりわけ珍しいものはなく、ホテル内のカフェやスタバでもよかったかなと思いました。ただ、2度と泊まりたくないというわけではなく、少し宿泊代の安い時期なら利用してもいいかなと思っております。それと、オンラインですぐに無料で会員になることができ、多少のメリットはあるようなので、入会してからの利用がよいかもしれません。,May 4| 2019,2,Hilton San Francisco Union Square,333 O'Farrell St.| San Francisco| CA| 94102

L'Hilton è un Hotel ubicato benissimo per muoversi a San Francisco. Molto pulito e pieno di attività. Essendo enorme con tantissime stanze ci sono alcuni disservizi| quali il check-in abbastanza lungo come tempi d'attesa. nella hall ci sono sempre tantissime persone.
