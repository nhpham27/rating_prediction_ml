Overall| we loved our stay! The only thing we didn’t like was the fact we paid for the parking| thinking it would be secure| but every single time we went in or out the barrier bar was always open. We were told our room key would open the gate| but we never even had to use it. Seems kinda pointless to pay a parking fee| while already paying for our stay| when it was really accessible to anyone.,Aug 19| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

It was really good we had a lot of fun really clean really lovely place I would love to go back there again,Aug 17| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868
Comfortable for a quick getaway,Aug 17| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868
Not enough luggage carriers. When we arrived we waited half hour-45 mins. The door man said no ones has brought them down. Asked at the front they said if there was any available they would be right by the main entrance. When we checked out there was none for another 45 mins. To big of a hotel to only 4!,Aug 17| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

Perfect stay,Aug 16| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868
Overall the experience was nice| unfortunately the AC in our room wasn't working to the fullest| but the room wasn't unbearable. Huge shout out to the maintenance men they were the most helpful and informative| many unique thing the hotel has to offer that would have been missed if they had not shared. Overall we would most likely come back again.,Aug 16| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

Overall it was fine| and quiet despite being close to the fwy. We really didn’t spend much time there except to sleep which was comfortable. However as we were checking to room to make sure we got all our things we noticed what looked like food skewers behind the chair| a bottle of vitamins under the bed| and a contact behind the sick facet. A bit unnerving.,Aug 14| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868
My overall stay was nice| room was clean| A/C a bit loud had to turn it off when I slept then the room got stuffy.  Not a fan of $23/day parking with in/out privileges since I was gone at 7:00 AM and returned at 10:00 PM.  Other hotels close by has free parking (need to add to the cost of the room per night).  The room was supposed to be taped on the door inform the customer that it was cleaned and sanitized but it wasn't.,Aug 13| 2021,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868
Very old not updated! Dirty| staff are not helpful| parking is not free||| not worth the price they charge!!! Definitely not coming back on this hotel!!!!,Aug 13| 2021,1,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868
The rooms were very clean and the staff was very friendly.  No problem with reservations and very quiet rooms.  I reserved 2 rooms and the staff was able to get me rooms that were connected.,Aug 13| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

Basic Doubletree| comfortable| and convenient. Fairly standard rooms with small-ish bathrooms. As is the case everywhere these days| they could use a few more employees| especially at the front desk. Parking and full breakfast are a bit of a rip-off.,Aug 9| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868
I would definitely stay there again| but the maids did not service my room for my four nights stay. This is why I rated it low. I had to check in twice because it was two reservations| and Hilton charged me again for the stay. I had to show them that I prepaid before they corrected their mistake. So they made up for their mistake by giving me free parking. Hilton does a great job when they realize a mistake. However| it doesn't make up for the delay when you're trying to make it to Disneyland before it gets really crowded.,Aug 8| 2021,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

Having to pay for internet service and parking is terrible.  The pool is small.  The hallways are not well lit.  The staff is great   It says the restaurant is open but it’s only open in the morning and then you can only get food from the bar which was good but small menu to choose from and just not comfortable  like when you sit in a restaurant,Aug 3| 2021,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

Had to pay for parking| then had to park around the corner in a parkade and walk back to hotel. Had to request a refridgerator and was charged extra for it. No Bell service| not enough luggage carts.,Jul 29| 2021,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868
I was charged extra without being notified in advanced. The receptionist was not professional.,Jul 29| 2021,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868
The check in was awful as there were only two attendants & an ULTRA long line of guests so it took a long time. Not good!Then out of the four elevators only one was working which was again not good. My elderly mother requires the elevator & there was a long wait to get to the room.,Jul 28| 2021,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868
I had my truck broken into and all my tools stolen. Very very mad at the situation. Parked in the parking structure between the first and second floor next to the camera. Someone from the hotel told me that this is the second time in a few weeks this has happened.

I'm going to try and make this short and to the point. The first night we arrived and the sheets smelt awful. I mean awful. It smelt like seafood and just stunk up the whole bed that my girlfriend was uncomfortable. We requested new sheets but the smell was not gone and we had to spray perfume every night to somewhat get the smell out. I didn't know they passed out welcoming cookies when you check in so the lady must've forgot but I got them the third day when a couple received them upon check in and I asked for it.

Absolutely NOT what I would expect of a Hilton property!! Elevators down and had to use the service elevator which we had to navigate through the kitchen| how the fire department hasn’t shut this property down is in question !! The PAID parking was a JOKE !| over packed and had to park in a handicap spot and worried all night about a violation or being towed !!!!!!

The staff at the counter was great they where very attentive and fast| i choose this hotel because I have always stayed at doubletree hotels in the past and they have been great and this one was one of the worst ones first elevators where not functioning during our stay there was only 1 elevator working at the time and for about 200 plus guest is ridiculous especially with the COVID pandemic going on and you have an elevator with like 15 people crammed in also the parking structure was very detached from the hotel wich they still charged a 25 dollar fee for parking per day I think that as much as a client pays for the stay they should reimburse for the inconvenience of elevator not functioning and we stayed there for 5 days and elevator was never fixed we waited for about 30 minutes before we can get on the elevator to get tot the lobby very disappointed with  our stay there,Jul 20| 2021,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

The parking fee was not disclosed at check in.  So a surprise bill of $23 charge will surprise you if you use the parking out front it the hotel.   Sneaky charges are not a good way to have repeat customer.   Just one of the four elevators was working and the room faced a hospital and all you can hear all night were sirens.,Jul 18| 2021,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

Hotel has definitely been ran down. Out of the 4 elevators only 1 worked. It would take 20 minutes just to get a elevator down to the lobby or up to your room. The hotel just seemed a little dirty and the room floors where somewhat sticky. On our way to checking out we decided to use the service elevators to get down quicker and we ended up getting stuck and having to climb down 16 floors with luggage.

Elevator was broken 15 minutes wait. They do not clean room unless you asked for it.  I booked two room l requested to be next to each other | when I checked in they said you have to pay extra if you you need them next to each other so I have no choice but to pay the extra for each room for each night.,Jul 17| 2021,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

The parking fee was not disclosed at check in.  So a surprise bill of $23 charge will surprise you if you use the parking out front it the hotel.   Sneaky charges are not a good way to have repeat customer.   Just one of the four elevators was working and the room faced a hospital and all you can hear all night were sirens.,Jul 18| 2021,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868
Very comfortable,Jul 18| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868
Hotel has definitely been ran down. Out of the 4 elevators only 1 worked. It would take 20 minutes just to get a elevator down to the lobby or up to your room. The hotel just seemed a little dirty and the room floors where somewhat sticky. On our way to checking out we decided to use the service elevators to get down quicker and we ended up getting stuck and having to climb down 16 floors with luggage. I wouldn’t stay here again,Jul 18| 2021,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

Elevator was broken 15 minutes wait. They do not clean room unless you asked for it.  I booked two room l requested to be next to each other | when I checked in they said you have to pay extra if you you need them next to each other so I have no choice but to pay the extra for each room for each night.,Jul 17| 2021,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

Upon check in I stated that I needed a pack and play brought to my room then went to my room and waited but they never showed up. I called the front desk to let them know that no pack and play had shown up to my room when they then assured me one would show up but after a significant amount of time waiting no pack and play showed up to my room.

Highly disappointed. I used to love staying here for my Disney trips. I understand things have changed due to covid| however when it is advertised on the hotels website and on hotels.com that they still have a free theme park shuttle| yet when you arrive they have no shuttle service anymore. It is extremely upsetting. They are aware that it is still showing on their website that they have a free parks shuttle and have yet to change it.  Being that I was over 3 miles away from the park I was counting on the shuttle as advertised and had to spend way too much money on Uber’s back and forth for 3 days| so that extra cost and inconvenience was upsetting| I would have rather put that money towards a hotel closer to the park in order to walk. Also due to covid they are doing a modified house keeping service| where they only come on one of that days of your choosing. We stayed 3 nights and asked for house keeping to come on the second day. They never came| had to ask the night manager for new towels and we never had anything in the room refreshed or replenished.

They were never around to answer the phone when we called to complain our ac wasn’t working both nights! And they were always under staffed on the front desk and The lines were always too long for someone to wait to talk to them. When you are there for a short time you really don’t want to spend it dealing with problems at the hotel. The manager Liz still hasn’t reached out to me after I complained.

No fridge was available in room so was more expensive  to keep having to buy food since i couldn't  store or eheat left overs. Ot keep beverages cold. No microwave. No free  wifi for guest. Only options  were to pay for 7 days even though  i was only there for two days. No cable.never had this happen to me where all these  main things were not included.,Apr 13| 2021,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868
Overall property is not bad| just not the greatest either. The simple fact that I have to pay $23.00 dollars a day so that I can park on your property is totally unacceptable and further more when you mention it to the front desk at the time of your check in as to why you were not made aware of this they have the nerve to say "I GUESS YOU DIDN'T READ THE SMALL PRINT THEN DID YOU" Really? I'm already paying to stay at your hotel and not cheap if I may add and for you to come and tell me after I have traveled for 5 hours to get there that you have some hidden fees that you don't disclose up front at the time of the reservation on the website and you need to charge me for parking is totally unacceptable.,Apr 12| 2021,1,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

My overall stay was pleasing| however for what I paid I would have expected a few more amenities in my room such as a mini fridge and/or a microwave. Then there were a few suspicious guests I had seen during my stay. The first night I had seen someone being escorted out by security and another time there was a family leaving and the parents looked to be under the influence of something. This made me wonder if I overpaid for this hotel. This hotel is in prime location. It’s right next to outlet mall| movie theater| plenty of restaurants| and just up the street from Angel Stadium. Now I know all these places around the hotel made helped establish such a high price| in my opinion. But $23/per night for parking is ridiculous. This was the big negative for me. Plus the arm bar for entering the parking didn’t work or got stuck half the time I was there. I should’ve probably asked for my money back just for parking.,Apr 10| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

Check-in was a breeze | but $28/night charge for parking is absolutely ridiculous! I paid for a room | it should be free. Secondly upon entering room there is no mini fridge at all .. and nowhere on website does it state that so had to fill sink up with ice to keep food cold entire stay.

Thought being on the 17th floor| it would be quiet| not so. Facing a major intersection| Chapman and City Dr.| it was like sleeping on the sidewalk right next to the traffic.

This was a change from my usual visits.  I was fine with no one servicing the rooms. I picked up fresh towels at the front desk. I did object to the policy of having guests leave their dirty towels outside their doors. These towels were only picked up once a day. Extremely unsanitary and made the halls look like a low rent motel.  They could have least required guests to place towels in the  plastic bag every closet has.  Why not have guests call the front desk to send someone to pick up these bags? Few people are staying at the hotel so it is not like this would be a huge task.

Nice place| COVID is taking its toll.In short the facility is very nice and well worth the price and especially now as the prices have dropped considerably.The down side is they are lightly staffed (so much so I could not contact the front desk after 9pm or ANY hotel service to get a couple towels for the room.Final slap| $23.00 for OVERNIGHT PARKING in an open lot| that does piss me off,Jul 1| 2020,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

We always stay at this hotel when coming to the LA area for our annual Disneyland visit. We were saddened to see that the Disneyland transportation is still being covered by the ART and not the "Cookie bus" as my kids call it. For this reason| we have to say good bye.

Unfortunately my personal property was taken from my room. I reported it to the front desk. It took three phone calls to find someone to come talk to me. The head of security finally came. She was very unprofessional. Didn’t bother to introduce herself to me or apologize. She handed me a paper to fill out| asked if the phone number I listed was the best number to reach me and said ok and started to walk away. I had to ask what was going to happen next. She rolled her eyes at me and said someone will look in to it and get in contact with me. I was so angry that there was no communication about the process of what to expect. She didn’t even look at what I wrote to understand what happened. I then asked her for a business card with her name and title. She walked away to get it. I then realized I didn’t have a copy of what I filled out so when she returned I asked if I could take a picture of it. She then asked if I would like a copy. Of course I said yes. When she returned I told her I thought she was very unprofessional. She stated she just had surgery the day before on her mouth and really couldn’t talk. I told her that maybe someone else should be helping me then. More than 24 hours later I have not heard from the property or the hotel chain.

This hotel will nickel and dime you-you pay for parking and for Wifi. I stay up here once a month and was tired of staying in cheaper| albeit noisy hotels so I booked here hoping for quiet. It's right next to UCI-so constant ambulances and helicopters. Also| you have to pay for parking and no free coffee-most hotels have free coffee/tea.  $23-not advertised when I booked. And theres no free Wifi| which is absurd in 2020. I'm headed back to the cheaper hotels with free WiFi.,Feb 11| 2020,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

I was given wrong information| before we arrive I phoned the front desk I was told that the shuttle to Disney park is free | but as soon as we checked in they said it is not free and I was given the rates for the fees of the shuttle service. Was so disappointed I will not recommend this place to stay. Also just to add I thought that this place is the one close to Disney when we arrive at the wrong location the one near Anaheim convention they said they cannot do something to help me change the hotel location so we have to bear with the situation and stay to this Orange location for the rest of our vacation. So frustrating  :(,Feb 8| 2020,1,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

This hotel will nickel and dime you-you pay for parking and for Wifi. I stay up here once a month and was tired of staying in cheaper| albeit noisy hotels so I booked here hoping for quiet. It's right next to UCI-so constant ambulances and helicopters. Also| you have to pay for parking and no free coffee-most hotels have free coffee/tea.  $23-not advertised when I booked. And theres no free Wifi| which is absurd in 2020. I'm headed back to the cheaper hotels with free WiFi.,Feb 11| 2020,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

Nice property| a tad outdated. The rooms are very basic| it was a huge disappointment finding out we hadno fridge in our room. There was also no active fan in the bathroom so anytime we took a shower the entire bathroom was wet from wall to wall. Parking is expensive either way so you might as well valet.

Greeted at the front desk by Kasia.  What a wonderful| sweet| pleasant and helpful person she is.  Bell service was fast| friendly and efficient.  The valet had my car ready before I even made it to the lobby.  Fantastic!!!  The only minor disappointment was the restaurant.  Thought it was a dinner house but more of a casual lunch type fare. Wait time for dinner from seated to dining was 40 minutes.  Service was very friendly though.

I stayed in three hotels over Thanksgiving Weekend - By far my favorite!,Dec 2| 2019,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868
The hotel and room were clean. Shower door was sliding open by itself| we notified the staff when we checked out. Overall people were friendly but nothing extraordinary. Not much extra for services| outlet mall nearby is good for shopping and food.,Nov 25| 2019,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

This was my third stay at this hotel over a 5 year period and it’s starting to feel a little tired. Additionally| the hotel used to provide a complimentary shuttle to Disneyland which we had loved on prior trips - this no longer exists and the current shuttle option provided by ART left much to be desired - it was always running late| and was over crowded. This shuttle cost roughly $32 for a three day pass for two of us and after three one way trips| we opted for Uber because the service was too unreliable. Although the hotel isn’t responsible for the third party provider| their prior complimentary shuttle was one of the main reasons we have been return customers.,Nov 18| 2019,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

The hotel trip seemed so amazing until I realized that my wallet was stolen by house-keeping. When I talked to the front desk| they told me to fill out a security report so I did. After that| nothing was taken care of. I was extremely disappointed in the way they handled the situation. I’m not asking to comp my entire stay| but something should have been done. I feel the manager should have apologized to me! I would have even appreciated a complementary breakfast. I am extremely disappointed in not only the staff stealing my property and going through my boyfriend’s bag while we were gone| but completely dismissing my feelings as a person who felt violated. I wish it would have been handled differently. Unfortunately I will never stay at this hotel again.,Oct 29| 2019,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

We arrived at 10:30pm and were told that our rooms would not be ready until 12:30am possibly 1am THE NEXT DAY.  This was because they allowed a large group to check out late and did not get the rooms ready. There were many many other guests waiting for their rooms as late as 11:30 pm. We had just flown in and were tired. We ended up finding another hotel. How can they run a business that way?,Sep 16| 2019,1,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

We arrived at 10:30pm and were told that our rooms would not be ready until 12:30am possibly 1am THE NEXT DAY.  This was because they allowed a large group to check out late and did not get the rooms ready. There were many many other guests waiting for their rooms as late as 11:30 pm. We had just flown in and were tired. We ended up finding another hotel. How can they run a business that way?,Sep 16| 2019,1,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

While I did get to see this property on the outside I never made it to my room. I called to let them know if would need to check in a few hours late and someone accidentally cancelled my reservation. Then they informed me they were booked for the night. I missed my work conference due to this error. The hotel did not offer or try to fix this error. Only Expedia did.,Sep 13| 2019,1,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

I like the proximity to Disneyland. Didn’t like how the refrigerator was extra fee when ALL the other Double Trees I’ve stayed in just came with the room.

I had a reservation and they sent me to another hotel because of a plane delay. When we got here they said| “sorry here’s some cookies” and that they were sending us to another hotel. When getting in at 2 am because you’re driving down it’s not convenient for you to switch hotels... I wish I was called or told when I called before we left Vegas that we wouldn’t get to stay here although we should have been priority because we had a reservation!! We get to the next hotel now and then they tell us “sorry we’re not giving you your one king bed you book but not a double queen room”.... was so upset! They then told us “oh but here you can have free breakfast (we didn’t care because that’s not the point. was it nice? yes but it wasn’t what we asked for either) They whole thing is we didn’t even get what we paid for and everything was a huge inconvenience. I’m too tired to argue at 2 am (I’m sure you’d understand this). I only stay at Hilton’s and Marriotts and I’m 25.

I stayed at the DoubleTree Hotel and it was a terrible experience. On our first night there| July 5th| there was a huge earthquake and we evacuated on our own (along with many other occupants at the hotel). There was no security measure or protocol to ensure that we got out safe. This involved many people running through the stairs on their own| without any guidance from the hotel. When we got downstairs| there was no direction or anything. The hotel did not even address this in any capacity| which is very dangerous and negligent. Secondly| the bedsheets were very odd| or maybe it was the bed. We could not sleep all night due to the constant itching from the bed/bedsheets.

I stayed at the DoubleTree Hotel and it was a terrible experience. On our first night there| July 5th| there was a huge earthquake and we evacuated on our own (along with many other occupants at the hotel). There was no security measure or protocol to ensure that we got out safe. This involved many people running through the stairs on their own| without any guidance from the hotel. When we got downstairs| there was no direction or anything. The hotel did not even address this in any capacity| which is very dangerous and negligent. Secondly| the bedsheets were very odd| or maybe it was the bed. We could not sleep all night due to the constant itching from the bed/bedsheets. It was a terrible stay and the staff was not trained to be attentive to our needs and safety as they should have been.

Stayed here one night for a work training. They let me check in early because the room was ready| which is always a big plus for me. The room was comfortable and clean. Everything worked well| though the thermostat instructions were not as clear as they could be. There was no fridge in the room| which I knew ahead of time| but I wish they had them in every room. The food for the training was prepared by the hotel and was pretty good. I didn't use the pool or eat at the other places inside. Very business-oriented hotel.

Hotel is way overpriced for what we got. Our room was right outside an elevator that had THROWUP all over the inside of it. Took the staff a long time to clean it up. Tiny room with double beds. Room is outdated & needs a remodel. Called for extra blankets & towels at 11pm & was told they dont have any housekeeping on duty that late & we had to go to the front desk to pick up our items. Are you kidding me? A major hotel chain this large doesn't keep housekeeping on staff at night? Ridiculous. Parking way crazy expensive too.

Overall it is a decent hotel. The down sides were the fire truck sirens and helicopter landing pad outside our window. We had a negative experience when we went for breakfast our first morning. The two of us got there about 10 minutes before the buffet was ending and were treated rudely by staff; they made it clear that they did not want to serve us. We chose not to stay and eat because of the lack of hospitality. We brought the situation up to staff at the front counter and they said sorry but no offer to follow up was made. So| we didn’t eat at the restaurant. The upsides - bed was comfy| the room and surroundings were clean and the concierge was helpful with our questions about the area.,May 3| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

Overall it is a decent hotel. The down sides were the fire truck sirens and helicopter landing pad outside our window. We had a negative experience when we went for breakfast our first morning. The two of us got there about 10 minutes before the buffet was ending and were treated rudely by staff; they made it clear that they did not want to serve us. We chose not to stay and eat because of the lack of hospitality. We brought the situation up to staff at the front counter and they said sorry but no offer to follow up was made. So| we didn’t eat at the restaurant. The upsides - bed was comfy| the room and surroundings were clean and the concierge was helpful with our questions about the area.,May 3| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868
Check in was fast| even with a huge line. The staff was professional| friendly| and fast paced.,Apr 30| 2019,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868
We had an excellent experience at this hotel| the staff that we dealt with were very kind and accommodating with our requests. We highly recommend this hotel.,Apr 29| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

Paid for this hotel a month prior| in full for 5 nights| states no additional charges....until you arrive and they inform you it’s $25 parking EACH DAY. Not garaged| in an open parking lot. Had to speak with management to get fees paid and they weren’t polite about it. Hotel very clean| everything in working order| very small bathroom in the room with double beds though.,Apr 28| 2019,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

Nice lobby but that is where the positives end. Poor location. Dont be fooled if you are looking to go to Disneyland. It is well out of the way. They do NOT have a free shuttle to Disneyland. They use the local bus system which comes at a cost. Not a small cost either. The rooms are small and if you get a room on the hospital side you will hear sirens all night long. You also hear the toilet flushing from the rooms above you as they are extremely loud. Bed is very soft and uncomfortable. Pillows almost non existent they are that awful. Was also treated like a criminal when me and my girlfriend arrived back to the hotel after midnight by a security guard. We were just looking for the hotels kiosk for a snack. Which does not exist by the way. A large hotel chain and big hotel but no store at all. Very poor stay overall. Would not stay here again. Also be aware of the deposit fee they charge. If a lengthy stay is booked it will become quite a large deposit fee on top of your room charge.,Apr 1| 2019,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868
Hotel is very nice in a convenient location| however I spent about $200 for one night with a room that had microwave or mini fridge which the website stated the room would come with. Room service was also a bit disappointing| I had ordered a meal and it didn’t show up. Called the front desk and they couldn’t complete the order because the kitchen was already closed (I had made the order 30min priorer to kitchen closing time to give them enough time). They did however give me a breakfast voucher for the mistake. This hotel is very nice| clean| in a very convenient location near target and shopping outlets yet I probably wouldn’t stay here again.

Definitely the worst doubletree I've ever stayed at. Outside and lobby are very nice and clean. The hotel rooms not so much. Out of date but the worst part is the cleanliness! Upon walking in. We stepped on a bunch of crumbled up oreos (so obviously they didnt vacuum). Carpet was dirty and sticky in general. The sheets smelled overwhelming of bleach but had stains. We go into the bathroom and counters are wet and sticky. But the worse part but the tub appeared to have chewed up food or something at the bottom| along with a bunch of hair and dirt. The picture here does not do justice. I couldn't bathe the kids in this. Had to have them stand on a towel and just shower| as it was late and we had to go to bed. To top it off| the tv and alarm clock also were not working. One of the hotel managers sent a text the next day asking about my stay and I told him what happened and his response was he would talk to the housekeeping manager. Yeah| sure! Definitely not the standards of a typical Doubletree and surely would not bother staying here again.,Mar 17| 2019,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

Customer service was good! Parking fills up at night so you will have to park in the overflow parking garage. I’ve stayed st doubletree many times| this is the only doubletree that hands out old hard cookies to customers. Probably won’t book at this location for business trips anymore.

Our stay was awesome! Clean space| well lit. We lucked out and our room faced Disneyland so we got to see the fireworks show from afar.  Shuttle to Disneyland was great; although it was a mad dash by customers to get on.

I stayed at the DoubleTree-Orange while my brother underwent heart surgery across The City Road at UCI Hospital. The hotel staff was very attentive and professional. They found another room in the heavily-bookend hotel when I had to extend my stay by two days. I would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone staying in the area.,Oct 24| 2018,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

EVERYONE there was so friendly and welcoming that we tried to extend our stay.We would highly recommend to persons traveling with families| and anyone wanting to visit Disneyland - the complimentary shuttles made it easy to get there and the drivers were friendly and helpful.Also| we discovered the Outlet mall which was short walking distance away - movies| bowling| pool| food and shopping - plenty to entertain the teenaged members of our larger family group during down time.Our sincere thanks and gratitude to everyone we came in contact with there - FOH staff| concierge| house keeping| Bar/Wait staff| shuttle drivers etc - you made the difference for us.,Oct 16| 2018,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

Overall my experience was positive but I prefer breakfast included packages. I went ahead and purchased the buffet breakfast but was not impressed. Also the shuttle service to Disneyland was a nice feature but when I went to board the 11 am departure with my watch reading 11:01 it was gone.  I would guarantee that of the people riding  the shuttle at least half of them had watches or cellphones or other devices that showed a range of 1 to 3 minutes time difference-they really need to provide some sort of grace period to allow for this difference- maybe 3 minutes or so!,Oct 15| 2018,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

Really helpful front desk. Angel accommodated is really well during check in and check out as we are also carrying a baby. Mary was really helpful during the night time despite having many request. Jay at the concierge was really great helping us find tours and confirm with me about the shuttle. It would be better if the Disney shuttle can run every half hr and more bus during peak hours. Only issue is the there is no bus schedule from 11-2.,Oct 12| 2018,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

Walking distance to orange outlet..we loved it!!! The breakfast was really good. There was a power cut (the whole Anaheim city) in the morning we had to check out. We had to carry our suitcases from level 17 to the lobby.

When I arrived at the hotel| I self-parked my car at a rate of $17/day| which seems a bit steep. Upon entering the lobby| it looked very nice with a quick food kitchen| lounge and coffee stand. The customer service rep that checked me in was friendly| helpful and gave us warm yummy cookies.When we entered our room| it smelled very strongly of stale cigarette smoke and mildew. I called guest services to request a different room. The person that I spoke with began to ask me questions of where i was smelling the cigarette smoke....the hallway| the room| somewhere else| and assured me that it was a non-smoking room. Odd and completely unnecessary questioning. Anyway| I was able to switch to another room on the same floor. The room smelled better but not good. It still had a musty| moldy smell. The rooms were not as nice in person| In comparison to how they looked online. Could use some updating| especially the bathrooms| as well as a deep cleaning. I didn't find the beds to be very comfortable either and didn't sleep well. The maid service also got progressively worse over the course of 3 mights. Based on my overall experience| I would not return to Doubletree. I will stick with ALO for now.Pros: shuttle to Disneyland| convenient location| warm cookiesCons: expensive parking| stale smelling rooms| (casino style)| undesirable bathrooms| uncomfortable beds| in-room water bottle costs $7! (Vending machine for $3.50 option was broken)| no complimentary breakfast.,Sep 8| 2018,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

Walking distance? 5mns if you had the 2mns from your room to the lobby.The hotel offers FREE shuttle to Disneyland| if you are brave to The Block mall| Angel Stadium| even DisneylandParking is $17 if you self park your car| we did Valet for $22The breakfast is $18/person and offers great selection of fresh fruits| juices| pastries| cerealsWe enjoyed our stay very much because of the location. The only thing they could improve is the noise of the AC...beside side| awesome service| excellent breakfast| perfect location for so many main location to visit in OC| plenty of dining restaurants around,Aug 19| 2018,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

Nice hotel with free shuttle service to Disneyland| the only downside is no refrigerator in the room.,Aug 19| 2018,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

The service was Terrible! The front desk staff is very unprofessional| unwelcoming and rude. Specially James who works the night shift. He for sure needs some customer service training. When we spoke to the manager regarding his rude behavior all we got is he is known to do that. What kind of answer is that coming from someone in charge?! I will never stay here again and would not recommend anyone else to do so. Not accomadating at all to families with small children.,Aug 17| 2018,1,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868

8月30日（金）のナイトゲーム後に1泊利用。延長戦だったので行きも帰りも歩ける距離（徒歩20-30分くらい）のこのホテルは便利だったが、よりスタジアムに近いのは「エンバシースイーツヒルトンアナハイムオレンジ」だと思います。誤算だったのはアナハイムの駅からの道のり。タクシーはおらず、ウーバーアプリもDLしてなかったので、駅のバスの案内窓口でホテルまでのシティバスでの行き方を教わりましたが降り方がわからず大失敗（笑）。wi-fiを持っていたので　Googleマップでバスの乗り換えを駆使して　かなり時間をロスってやっと到着。翌朝も早かったので試合優先で予定していたオレンジアウトレットにはいきませんでしたが、さまよったぶん、町の様子がわかって面白かったです。アウトレットに行きたいがためにこのホテルにしたので、野球観戦+ショッピングならこちらがいいのではないでしょうか。日本でヒルトンオーナーズに登録したらWi-Fiが無料になっていました。あと朝は駅の売店は開いてなかったので朝早い場合はホテルの売店で何か買うのをおすすめします。球場は何もかも「高い」です。ビールは７ドル。大半は缶をカップに移し替えですが１か所？　クラフト系の美味しいビール店がありました。ギフトショップで水を買ったら2本で９ドルしてびっくり。ならホテルの部屋の大きめ瓶の７ドルのほうがマシだった。夕食は球場で済ませましたが「ナチョス」18ドルくらいがボリューム感あり美味しかったです。,Sep 8| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Anaheim - Orange County,100 The City Dr S| Orange| CA| 92868
