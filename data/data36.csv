it you have another option take it,Aug 19| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
The room was just ok. The ceiling had visible patches from water damage| the bathroom door was pretty beat up| and the sink wouldn’t drain. There were crumbs in the sofa bed| which we used for sleeping. The front desk staff was rude and incompetent- charging us for things we’d prepaid| giving me floor mats instead of bath towels that were still damp (our room wasn’t adequately stocked with towels)| etc. I wouldn’t stay here again.,Aug 17| 2021,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
Check in was super fast and friendly.  Shuttle service was quick and on time.  Rooms were very clean and comfortable.,Aug 17| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay. We were satisfied w/the condition of the hotel. The breakfast was nice| but was a little disappointed that there was no fresh fruit| along w/other items| usually served for breakfast. We were definitely satisfied| and looking forward to staying there| again| soon.,Aug 11| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

That hotel is not clean.,Aug 7| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
Housekeeping needs to step it up. Our whole bathroom had black mold that hasn’t been scrubbed in awhile. Patio door hasn’t been cleaned in a long while either. We enjoyed being by the airport and the inside lobby is really pretty,Aug 7| 2021,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
I flew in with my family via LA from Panama. I  reserved this hotel because I have had great experiences at other Embassy Suite locations. I saw they offered Airport Transfers| we landed at 11PM and come to find out their airport service stops at a certain time| for a hotel that is 1.5 miles from the airport they should continue to run this service| end result was paying for two cabs to get the the hotel and of course they charge the LA minimum. I checked in they give me a room without a frosted window where you cannot see anything| also had a strong smell of smoke. I do not recommend staying at this location if traveling with family or just needing a room to stay.,Aug 5| 2021,1,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
When we arrive to the hotel we asked a room on the fifth floor. The girl on front desk said ok but you have to wait like an hour in a half .We waited in a lobby more than hour in a half and then they said we are sorry but all rooms are busy on fifth floor.. Then they said they don't have a cleaning Service for every day. They can do just one time whitch they didn't do even one time for our five nights reservation.. Every day we had to go to the front desk and ask them  for towels.One day they even told us we are out of towels..Breakfast is not like it was before not even close.For some reason they told us before we booked the hotel that everything the same but its not..Laundry was broken all the time and we couldn't do the laundry too.And the worst what was happened the Elevator was stock one night and we got so scared to death..My family so disappointed about this hotel ..We definitely never ever come again ..,Aug 5| 2021,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
Pool closed due to not enough staffing. Happy hour gone and breakfast was ok it used to be great. They are understaffed. They charge more for less service now my kids were really bummed out there was no pool,Aug 4| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

The bathrooms where old and mold was in between the tile of the shower. I asked to switch rooms| the other room was just as bad with the mold in between the tile of the showers,Aug 4| 2021,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

It was a nice hotel but the pull out bed could of had nicer blankets . The blanket felt like something you would use for moving .

I’ve stayed at this hotel prior n boy what a difference.  The hotel smelt so bad. A mix between pot and dirty socks.   The breakfast was disgusting and not cooked to order.  N yes I know there’s a pandemic ........it’s really run down and old..... the bathroom vanity panel was all busted up ...would def not recommend this  hotel.,Jul 20| 2021,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

Property was so outdated| tubs were stained| walls were stained. No air filtration in the room. My kids had to sleep on the floor because the mattress on the sofa bed was so thin the rails were digging in their back. Bathroom was small| toilet did not flush upon arrival| had to call maintenance. Pool was closed| lobby smelled like a swamp. Balcony was so tiny. I just wouldn’t recommend this hotel to anyone.

This hotel was not what I expected. It looked nice on the outside but as soon as I walked in it had a musty odor. The front lobby attendant was okay but not super helpful or knowledgeable.  The room was pretty warm | the beds were comfortable but small. Overall I would say our experience was below average on the enjoyable rating.

I chose this hotel because it said that it had airport to hotel transfers and breakfast included. When we got to the airport in LA| I called the hotel only to be told that they no longer offered them and to take a cab from the airport.  When I stated that that was the reason I chose the hotel through Hotels.com| the clerk told me “Well| the information is on our website.”  When you go through a third party to book| you don’t go to the hotel’s website.  I’m sure I am not the first person this happened to and probably not the last. Also| there was no breakfast available at the time we had to leave for the airport the next morning. We paid top dollar for an “airport hotel” for 5 hours at a airport hotel without airport amenities!  We returned to Lax 1 week later for our return to Florida. This time we stayed the Lax Hampton that while not offering a shuttle| did pay for the cab/Lift to and from the airport. They also had on the go breakfast.,Jun 28| 2021,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

Very clean And the breakfast was better than expected usually all the stays I've had at hotels during COVID didn't serve any hot breakfast but Embassy did. I enjoyed my stay we are regulars with  Embassy especially when we're doing family trips.

I will never stay there again.,Jun 16| 2021,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

Very clean And the breakfast was better than expected usually all the stays I've had at hotels during COVID didn't serve any hot breakfast but Embassy did. I enjoyed my stay we are regulars with  Embassy especially when we're doing family trips. The parking is $36 a night but there is parking on the street.,Jun 15| 2021,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
The service was great. The team was nice and responsive. Easy access to LAX and beach.,Jun 15| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
The staff was extremely rude when asking them questions very short and blunt. And you get a different answer from different staff however| there was one staff member that was kindly and helpful. Sorry I can’t recalled her name.,Jun 14| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
You can not look out windows. Window in bedroom frosted glass. This should be stated upfront,Jun 14| 2021,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
Everything was nast about this hotel from the overall look to the doors walls and toilet. The toilet screeched all night. The walls has holes abd was dirty. All the trash cans was overflowing. The doors didnt have locks the air conditioner was broke. The pool was broke abd dirty the lobby smelled like urine it was terrible never ever ever again.,Jun 13| 2021,1,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

I decided I needed a little get away| so checked into this hotel with hopes of sleeping in. That didn't happen due to them repairing (loud banging) at 6am. The water kept going on & off. The water had cut off while in the shower also. This hotel is in need of a major update. There's lots of water damages in the bathroom ceiling & walls. Beds was lumpy feeling. There was crumbs in the pullout couch bed as if they didn't change the bedding from the last people whom used it. The carpets are badly stained. The couch has stains as well. The chair was ripped. Just a lot of disappointing things especially when u pay the high amount of money for this place. And also my room wasn't ready when I went to check in. Had to sit in the lobby for an hour. Only thing we enjoyed was the view of the airplanes at lax.,May 24| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

I did have an issue the restaurant needs to put a limit or watch how intoxicated a guest is. While waiting to purchase a meal| my daughter was being harassed by a Caucasian drunk woman. As I intervene I noticed she had too many alcoholic drinks in front of her. She started to harass me but I didn’t stay quiet. As I yelled at her she quickly looked down and her husband told her to relax. I got my food and my daughter and i walked to our room but I was very upset.,Apr 28| 2021,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

However the heat didn’t work in the room and I first thought my husband couldn’t work a thermostat but that was not the case. At night it gets cool and we got cold and the higher the thermostat was| it just didn’t blow hot air. In fact I couldn’t feel anything out of the vent except the one in the bathroom.

I hate that I select this hotel for my 3 day getaway. My bathroom ceiling leak| noisy hotel and the breakfast on the go was a brown paper bag with a fruit| muffin and package of instant oatmeal that you have to make yourself.

It's was a very nice room. I like that there was like a living room seperate from the bedroom. I didn't like that the TV didn't have Netflix or streaming apps. The internet also doesn't support anything like a Roku or Amazon Fire stick. I really wanted to catch up tv shows| but couldn't. Which was a big let down for me.,Aug 27| 2020,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

I clearly did not read the reviews before booking and boy what a mistake that was. This was by far the WORST Embassy Suites that we have ever stayed in. The lobby| elevator| and rooms had a terrible smell. My wife spent the first hour trying not to vomit while adjusting to it. You could also hear all conversations from the hallways and rooms next to you. On a positive note the staff was friendly and on street parking was easy to find.,Aug 23| 2020,1,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
Yuck! They are ridiculously overpriced for a tacky smelly old building with ZERO amenities! They have the balls to charge $40 for parking too! What a joke!!! This place gives all Embassy suites a bad name,Aug 22| 2020,1,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
The room was not so clean as it seemed. The restroom was dirty and the restroom door was broken it would get stuck when you closed the door and you would have to push on it hard to open it really disappointed,Aug 17| 2020,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

Front desk service was fantastic| but the hotel was dark| room clean but outdated and needed painting| cabinets refreshed| etc. Also| no airport shuttle service while the sister hotel less then @2 -3 miles offered shuttle service. Get your act together| so you’re still in business after all this noise-mask or no mask| providing fantastic service and overcoming obstacles is what’s required to successfully survive this environment.,Aug 17| 2020,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
I understand this is covid19 pandemic however if your going to still reserve rooms they should at least be clean. Also I didn’t get the room I reserved and nothing was available in the hotel horrible stay. The rooms are old and needs to be upgraded. No parking $36 to park insane. This is the worst embassy I have ever stayed at.

I understand this is due to Covid but the website should have been updated with the correct info. Also| parking is $36.00 a night which is ridiculous.

So on 4/15/2020 my wife and I decided to stay at Embassy suites for the very 1st time. I WILL DEFINITELY NOT BE RETURNING OR RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. I’m allergic to dust and when I checked into my room| I turned on the A/C and went to bed. 2 hrs later I woke up drenched in sweat| with red|swollen| itchy eyes due to my allergy reaction from the dust collected in heat vents. I looked at the A/C monitor saw that it read 65 degrees| confused but being the good person I am I| turned off the AC| opened a window and decided I’ll just call in the morning about it.I called the front desk and explained the issue...Both the front manager and the General manager| were the most disrespectful and unprofessional managers that I have ever came across and shouldn’t be working in the service industry. They offered me only a 20% discount stating it wasn’t their fault and explained that the ax only has 3 set temperatures that u could put it on and the weather outside effects the temperature so if it’s cold out it will turn heater on. Never have I ever heard something like this. I was never told this because if I was I wouldn’t have stayed at this hotel. So if you like sleeping with the ac unit on don’t stay at this hotel.,Apr 17| 2020,1,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

I tried not to listen to all the bad reviews about this hotel but they were almost all true! Walking into the hotel the water fountain was dripping but we were greeted with a smile. The hotel room smelled like wet cigarettes. The bathroom had water damage. It’s a completely outdated hotel. The balcony that gives a view of the city was tiny. There was no room for a chair. However| I loved the balcony that faced the inside of the hotel. The breakfast was awesome. This was my first experience at Embassy Suites.,Mar 17| 2020,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

The hotel is good for the price. I visited from Friday - Sunday in late February. The location is very close to the airport and to the freeway. So I was pleasantly surprised at how quiet the interior is. I ordered a fan because I typically need one so it may have blocked som if the outside noise however in the past I could still hear hallway noise if not outside doors. My biggest concern with the property is that my room was a little smelly and there is rust in areas of the bathroom. Overall for the price this hotel is a fair value for budget conscious travelers with a family.,Mar 8| 2020,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

After arriving at LAX we called for the van to pick us up.  No one answered the phone a number of times.  We followed the directions that we were told as far as contacting the hotel directly.  Eventually someone answered and told us to go to level 2 and call back.  Not a good way to begin our trip.,Mar 7| 2020,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
We were returned to stay at this hotel because we love our last stay 2years ago.  However| At this time| the staff at the front desk was not helpful and friendly as before.  Wendy makes me feel like I bother her.  She talked like robot.  The room wasn't ready when we check-in.  It was around 3:30 pm. She said it's wait time around 20 min.  I told her I don't' want to wait I can take any room.  She said I have to pay extra if I changed room type.  I refused to pay so we wait.  However| it took longer than 20 min.  Until passed 20 min.  Wendy left and someone else helped me. When we entered the room.  The carpet was not clean and it's so sticky. we need to wear shoes in the room.  I found the gum next to the chair.   We were in room 106.  My husband doesn't' move because we were so tired because of travel back to Boston the next day.  Room cleanliness was very disappointed.  No complimentary water for HHonors.   Only 2 things I like there are the manager reception staff and a van driver were so nice.   Check out staff didn't ask my stay at all and I don't' want to tell because it's her job to ask the guest.   I don't' think I will go back there again.,Mar 7| 2020,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

We stay at a lot of Embassy Suites and I have to say I found this one architecturally my favorite it is a beautiful hotel. The employees here are very friendly and helpful. The manager’s even reception was good the bar tenders were very friendly and like to talk they made you feel like your at home. We had dinner in the restaurant I had the New York steak it was delicious cooked to perfection my husband had the turkey sandwich which was great. I would highly recommend this hotel.,Feb 22| 2020,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

We ordered food and the kid’s meal they sent was completely cold. We had to wait on that| and the meal for two adults and a kid was $90. The food should be fresh. They replaced it| but we were finished eating by the time it came back. We had to call the restaurant 4-5 times and the front desk several times to get this resolved.

Both the front desk clerk and the front desk manager could not find my second room attached to my reservation. This was despite me actually showing them both the confirmation email I received from Hotels.com. The manager refused to acknowledge that I indeed had a second run as my confirmation clearly showed and suggested that had I booked with Hilton directly I would not be having the problem that I was incurring. The front desk staff was rude| and accommodating and unprofessional. I was forced to pick up a second room which cost me $20 more than the rate I had reserved through Hotels.com. It was either that or move my entire party out at 7 PM and find a different hotel.Despite every other advantage that this hotel offers based on the lack of service by all levels I would not recommend anybody staying here.,Jan 6| 2020,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

Both the front desk clerk and the front desk manager could not find my second room attached to my reservation. This was despite me actually showing them both the confirmation email I received from Hotels.com. The manager refused to acknowledge that I indeed had a second run as my confirmation clearly showed and suggested that had I booked with Hilton directly I would not be having the problem that I was incurring. The front desk staff was rude| and accommodating and unprofessional. I was forced to pick up a second room which cost me $20 more than the rate I had reserved through Hotels.com. It was either that or move my entire party out at 7 PM and find a different hotel.Despite every other advantage that this hotel offers based on the lack of service by all levels I would not recommend anybody staying here.,Jan 6| 2020,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

We have stayed at this hotel before for a morning flight out. It is a very nice hotel! Has a crib for our daughter| big room| free breakfast and free drinks and snacks during a certain time at night. The shuttle is great and got us to the airport on time! Will stay at this hotel every time we are in LA flying out in the morning!,Jan 5| 2020,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

The hotel shuttle schedule and service was great. Did not like the condition of the room. Room is old and the bathroom door had a hard time closing correctly.,Jan 5| 2020,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
No hot water in the room| I called the front desk and was told| “it takes a few minutes to warm| it’s not instant”.. so after about 15 minutes and a call back to the front desk we ran out of time for our entire party to shower.. Ooh| the biggest issue- Don’t let the “free shuttle service to airport” lure you in. What they don’t tell you is they have two shuttles| maybe 20 passengers each| and they are both full with an “I’m sorry| wait for the next shuttle in half hour” as your parting gift. We ended up taking an Uber.,Jan 1| 2020,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

The hotel is very clean | the breakfast buffet it’s very good| the social hour with free alcohol  drinks and snacks it’s very good . The staff very helpful and friendly. There is also a gym to use .

Our recent stay was poor.  The toilet was inoperable. We contacted maintenance and he came| pulled apart the toilet and said we may need a new toilet and then left.  After an hour| we went to the front desk to inquire| and he told us the maintenance man said he left because someone was taking a shower.  No one was taking a shower.  Our son was sitting in the living room with his girlfriend.  They then said he man would be right back.  He fixed the toilet and left.  He left the floor dirty| and left our bath mat wet| and filthy.  The temperature control is unacceptable in that there is no way to cool the room .  They have no air conditioning during this time of year.  It became so warm and stuffy that my husband’s glasses steamed up.  ( humorous... but not) We had our 9lb dog with us and were told originally that there would be a $35 pet deposit| only to find out that they charged us $40 PER NIGHT. We called housekeeping and asked for 2 pillows and 4 towels.  They brought us 2 pillows only.  When we called back | they told us they would bring the 4 towels.  They then brought us 2 towels and 2 blankets?? We have used this hotel for years for both ourselves| as well as family when they came to visit.  After the last 2 visits|  we will be looking for another hotel.,Dec 29| 2019,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

I've been here several times but this visit was not so good. Somethings i can deal with but i had a problem with the heat in my room. It was so hot i tried to turn the AC on to cool off and it was getting worse and it eventually jst shut off and would not come back on. I called and complained about the heat and I was given a cheap floor fan that didn't do anything. It was so miserable I couldn't rest finally the next morning I had to call again and finally the manager changed my room with the AC working. I appreciate the manager accomodating me and he was very nice. But i didn't understand why they will have engineering turn the thermostate to heat and I was told we could not control it from the rooms. This has never happened since I've rented there. I have to travel again next weekend and I'll try embassy suites again and if AC doesn't work that will be my last visit. If I pay for a room I expect to be comfortable.,Dec 16| 2019,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
All of the employees| with the exception of one front desk person who seemed a bit tense| were very friendly and helpful. The 2 shuttle drivers I encountered were very polite and personable. I didn't receive my bag of complimentary waters for being a rewards member| but did very much appreciate the breakfast each morning.

Overall the experience is ok| subpar for an Embassey suite. The bed is uncomfortable and the carpet isn’t clean. My room 250 carpet was sticky and my son’s room 248 something bit his feet (he was walking around barefoot) and his feet sole is swollen.Breakfast was good but I wish they would label the food better.,Dec 9| 2019,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
The stay was ok the room smelled | the part I didn’t like is they increased the parking to $35 a night instead of $16| and if choose not to pay the $35 I have to drive around the neighborhood to look for parking space which took an hour or so until someone leave their parking space.,Dec 9| 2019,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

I did not like my room being so close to the front of the building totally noisy from shuttle buses and street traffic when there were plenty of rooms available in the hotel on a different floor and a different area of the building itself.

Unfortunately this is a very hot property. The room would not cool down past 72 degrees and quite a bit humidity. While some people can handle that| I need the room a bit cooler. They even brought Maintenace in| but they could not fix the air. It’s an older building with a different air system. If you need a cool room| avoid at all cost.,Nov 4| 2019,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

This hotel was awful! Customer service didn't exist.  When we arrived| we were convinced to upgrade to a beautiful suite with a balcony and a view for only $25 extra per night. Well|  the balcony was a barred in ledge. The phone didn't work. The wifi wasn't included. The pool had things floating on the top of the water. I complained to the general manager of the location and he actually told me that his hotel was not for vacationing|  rather more for business in and out meetings. He also told me that the word "balcony" may have different meanings| and his was not truly a balcony to sit on. The "beautiful" view from our room was of the airport and the kicker was when I finally went to bed the room shook everytime a plane took off.

Park on the street it's free. Other wise it's $36.00 a day. Breakfast is nice with the hot omelet bar. It's made to order. French toast is great| No fan in the bedroom only in sitting area| So we had to keep the a/c on 63 to keep cool. The beds are double size so if your tall it's short. The hotel has a happy hour for free from 5:30-7:30 free drinks and snacks. Nachos and popcorn| Help yourself. The room needs a update but comfortable and clean. They do have a restaurant onsite pricey. Indoor pool so bring a swimsuit. They need to wash the tables after breakfast not just clear off the plates. The highchair was totally gross.

Had a lovely stay me and family.food was excellent,Sep 16| 2019,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
Layout of the rooms was nice and location convenient. However| the rooms are quite dated and the mattresses were terrible! We were in two separate rooms and the mattresses in both were sagging and not at all supportive.Staff was very pleasant and accommodating. If not for the mattresses| I would have rated this higher. Despite the dated decor| it was clean and nice.,Sep 16| 2019,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
Spacious rooms| nice design. We loved that there are two rooms and fridge/microwave. Breakfast was great.,Sep 16| 2019,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
The property was nice but i didnt like the fact that we had to get up at 3am to change to another room because water was leaking inside the room i was in and once i checked out the room i ask them how was they gonna compensate me for the inconvenience they caused nd their response was since i didnt book the room straight from their website i have to deal with Expedia since i booked from there,Sep 16| 2019,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
Stayed here for our connection to Japan.  This hotel is exactly as it is pictured.  So beautiful on the outside and inside.  My only complaint is the shuttle time service| otherwise it was very nice that the driver offered us water| especially after a long flight.  The hotel is very clean and the breakfast is one of the best I've had with a good variety and a made to request grill.  The pool is beautiful even though we didn't get to use it and the little outside garden is cute.

The rooms are too dark and need to be renovated. Our room smelt damp and when we showered a disgusting smell (like rotten eggs) emitted from the sink in the bedroom.

We booked this hotel| because their proximity to LAX and shuttle service. We ended up waiting more than one hour for the shuttle and we're lied to by the hotel about when it's going arrive and when it left the hotel several times.Check-in efficient| but unfriendly. Hotel room toilet wasn't cleaned properly| backsplash on the cover.Hotel hallway was filthy with a big stain of what liked like vomit| but was a very sticky mass. No effort to clean that or to at least cover it up. People stepped into it one after another.Telephone in the room didn't work.The list goes on... not even so much as an "I'm sorry" from the front desk. QGreat shuttle drivers| baggage handlers and security personnel though.,Aug 17| 2019,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
There is a huge inside courtyard that is a nice touch when walking through the hotel. There’s complementary hot breakfast as well as complementary cocktail hour with a few snacks an open bar. They have an indoor pool strong with chlorine no ventilation no Jacuzzi but at least they have a pool.

The rooms are too dark and need to be renovated. Our room smelt damp and when we showered a disgusting smell (like rotten eggs) emitted from the sink in the bedroom. Trays need to be provided for the breakfast buffet.,Aug 17| 2019,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

We booked this hotel| because their proximity to LAX and shuttle service. We ended up waiting more than one hour for the shuttle and we're lied to by the hotel about when it's going arrive and when it left the hotel several times.Check-in efficient| but unfriendly. Hotel room toilet wasn't cleaned properly| backsplash on the cover.Hotel hallway was filthy with a big stain of what liked like vomit| but was a very sticky mass. No effort to clean that or to at least cover it up. People stepped into it one after another.Telephone in the room didn't work.The list goes on... not even so much as an "I'm sorry" from the front desk. QGreat shuttle drivers| baggage handlers and security personnel though.,Aug 17| 2019,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
There is a huge inside courtyard that is a nice touch when walking through the hotel. There’s complementary hot breakfast as well as complementary cocktail hour with a few snacks an open bar. They have an indoor pool strong with chlorine no ventilation no Jacuzzi but at least they have a pool.

great location free shuttle to airport. pets allowed with $40 fee. showers were outdated in my room and faucet fell completely off while in use. bed is super soft and comfy. enjoyed breakfast. wehad an excessive amount of bags due to a relocation and left an item behind and 12 days later have not  been contacted back. very unfortunate!,Aug 12| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
Overall stay was Ok; however| we had problem with our reservation from the start. I called on a day of check in and they could not find my reservation| I called Expedia representative could not find it either. It was nerve racking 40 min.. When we finally checked in| the bedding for the couch was missing| i called the front desk twice and then went there for the sheets to be delivered to our room. Also| about guess laundry| they only have 2 washers and 2 dryers and washer didnt work for the first 3 days of our stay| really inconvenient with kids. Breakfast was delicious!!!

We arrived and told that our room wasn't ready.  They were going to call my cellphone when it was. Meanwhile we sat right there in the lobby watching about 25 other families check in and get their room keys. I finally walked up in line again to ask about our room. They had forgotten to call us.The room was very nice. We then headed to the pool. The maximum capacity was 25 in the pool because it's a small pool| however| there were about 45-50 kids in it like sardines. We left the pool. My son (11) yrs old was disappointed. Dinner in the restaurant was great but the waiter had an attitude so I left him a small tip. Movies on the tv to order were expensive.  $20.00.

I think there was one decent one in the bunch of extra pillows I requested to try and solve the problem.    It never ceases to amaze me when hotels don’t replace their pillows!! It’s such an inexpensive upgrade!   Our girls were so looking forward to the indoor pool but returned quickly reporting that it was cloudy and so gross in there.

I’ve always enjoyed staying at this hotel. However| our stay this year was different. The rooms weren’t clean properly and smelled like smoke| the beds weren’t properly made and the carpeting littered with bits of trash left behind by previous occupants. The best part of our stay was the happy hour drinks and breakfast... the staff for both of these were exceptional. Nycole and Juan are fantastic and our favorite staff members. I’m sad to say I will not return to stay at this location though as I no longer feel comfortable in a hotel where staff are likely to steal items from guests and get away with it. I mistakenly left my Fitbit Versa sitting on the bathroom counter the day I left for Las Vegas for a few days and came back to discovered it missing. I’ve communicated with the management immediately and got the run around with solid course of action from them. I know I will not get the tracker back and have little faith that management will do anything about the theft| therefore| I will no longer patronize this location or the Embassy Brand.,Jul 1| 2019,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

I’ve always enjoyed staying at this hotel. However| our stay this year was different. The rooms weren’t clean properly and smelled like smoke| the beds weren’t properly made and the carpeting littered with bits of trash left behind by previous occupants. The best part of our stay was the happy hour drinks and breakfast... the staff for both of these were exceptional. Nycole and Juan are fantastic and our favorite staff members.

The Embassy Suite has always been our go to hotel for our family trip but this last trip we are considering to look elsewhere. Let’s just say out of all the Embassy suits I have stayed in this was the worst. Customer service was rude| rooms where dirty. One of the beds has blood stain the comforter sheets. Their free breakfast are normally good but at this location was nasty. Their were flies flying around your food when eating. The milk smell spoiled and juice was watered down. Also over price.

AMAZING HOTEL! We found and booked this hotel last minute as a change from one we already had booked and checked into and were not pleased with. I was taken back by the resort feel this hotel had. The rooms were so big and clean. We booked 2 rooms but could have easily stayed in 1 with all the extra space. The free breakfast was a bonus and delicious. The bar/restaurant we ate at had the best chicken quesadillas I have ever had| and our waiter was so quick and friendly.

I usually love staying at an embassy suites hotel but this one fell so short from my expectation.First| the pool was disgusting| incredibly dirty and it looked like the area might be under construction or just left undone.Second| the bartender during happy hour was incredibly rude and seemed inconvenienced when we placed our drink orders. Third|  I paid for 2 nights of parking but was advised at the reception desk if I didn’t use the parking pass on the second night to bring my parking pass back and I would only be charged for 1 night. On the day of check out I saw I had been charged for the second night| even though I had turned in the parking pass. When I called to have the charge fixed| the receptionist said she would as a courtesy refund the charge... instead of apologizing for their mistake. I will never stay at that hotel again.,Jun 5| 2019,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

I liked their gift shop. Seemed centrally located to all places we wanted to see. Did not like that they had 1 bell hop if they even did. was on break at check out time. Strange. He should be on duty. Busy time. Holiday weekend. Front desk wanted me to leave luggage & when he would return they would have him take luggage to store room which was dirty. no one to watch luggage. Even at the airport they tell you not to leave luggage unattended.Had security bring luggage to storage room. I followed to make sure luggage got to storage room. Not enough towels in room. I asked for 6 more. Told I only have 1 person in room.  My business how many times I take a shower a day & wash my hair. 2 towels needed each time. Service slow that's why I asked for 6 so I wouldn't have to wait. Understaffed.  Holiday weekend. Should be staffed so there is no waiting. Frustrating. Shuttle drivers very friendly and helpful. Jacuzzi not working. Heard desk person tell a customer they were getting rid of it. Should be told to customers when they check in. Seemed like lack of staff caused a lot of problems for customers.,May 28| 2019,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

I liked their gift shop. Seemed centrally located to all places we wanted to see. Did not like that they had 1 bell hop if they even did. was on break at check out time. Strange. He should be on duty. Busy time. Holiday weekend. Front desk wanted me to leave luggage & when he would return they would have him take luggage to store room which was dirty. no one to watch luggage. Even at the airport they tell you not to leave luggage unattended.Had security bring luggage to storage room. I followed to make sure luggage got to storage room. Not enough towels in room. I asked for 6 more. Told I only have 1 person in room.  My business how many times I take a shower a day & wash my hair. 2 towels needed each time. Service slow that's why I asked for 6 so I wouldn't have to wait. Understaffed.  Holiday weekend. Should be staffed so there is no waiting. Frustrating. Shuttle drivers very friendly and helpful. Jacuzzi not working. Heard desk person tell a customer they were getting rid of it. Should be told to customers when they check in. Seemed like lack of staff caused a lot of problems for customers.,May 28| 2019,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

Beautiful hotel.. love the restaurant..  complementary breakfast was very good.. my only problem I had was the maid came twice to my room..

We came to town a day early to enjoy a bit of vacation before my husband's business trip started. This hotel was soooo wonderful that I'm seriously thinking about booking it again for the last night of our trip! You walk into pure and blissful luxury. The restaurant is wonderful. The staff are not only helpful but personable too. And| the cook to order breakfast was just magnificent. Add to that the outdoor terrace and free alcoholic beverages from 5:30-7:30pm| and this place just can't be beat!,May 19| 2019,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

What a great place to stay for over night parking for vacations. I found this hotel only because the other local hotels were fully booked. I'm glad they were because this location was so easy to stay the night at and leave my Jeep for the week while flying out of LAX. The room was big and parking was very easy thanks to the easy to locate parking structure under the hotel and free LAX shuttle service. The shuttle was only 5 minute drive to LAX with traffic. Highly recommend this location to anyone looking for a place to stay the night and beat the LA traffic before a flight.,Apr 10| 2019,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

It is definitely a bit run down in the rooms. The pool was also pretty small and super overfilled and loud. The breakfast and managers reception could use more fruits and veggies.

The listing specified it was a 2bdrm suite along with the pictures which when we walked in our room it was a one bedroom suite with two beds in it and a sofa bed which was very uncomfortable the stay was good but the sleeping comfort was not. It was not enough space for 4 adults and two children,Mar 26| 2019,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
I stayed at the property for the heated pool. The only issue that occurred was kids with no adult supervision| they were  being loud and upnoxiuos.,Mar 26| 2019,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

We had a very disappointing stay at this property.  LA was really cold the days we were there.  I called the front desk on our first night because the heat didn't seem to be working.  The person who answered told me the heat would not come on until 1am.  I was offered a space heater and extra blankets.  The security guard brought up the items -- carrying the 'clean' blankets against his outdoor coat.  The room was older and had peeling wallpaper.  The nightstand was sticky from the previous guests.

I've only been to at least 5 Embassy Suites and this one is the lowest of its standard. Ceiling are still those popcorn kind.

My family enjoyed the hotel breakfast and indoor swimming pool very much.  The hotel has underground parking but cost $30/night.  We did not use it and can find street parking right out side the hotel.  The area is seem very safe and we had park our car on the street for the three nights  and has no problem find the parking.  But just need to watch the street sight because they wash the street twice a week.  We enjoy very much with this hotel location| clean room| friendly staff and great value.  We will come back again if we are in LA area again.,Jan 6| 2019,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
I stay at this hotel often.  This is the first time I've had an issue. I requested a certain room because I have OCD. Upon check-in I was told the room wasn't ready wasn't ready. I waited 1 1/2 hrs then told it was occupied. I rev'd an upgrade. New room was ice cold and so was the weather. I was told the system changes from hot to cold around 10 p.m. at 11 p.m. The air system was blowing cold with thermostat at 74 degrees. I called front desk at least 4 times. Each time someone showed up to the room with a portable heater| so I ended up with 4 heaters. No manager came upstairs no manager called. I asked to speak with the manager I was left on hold twice and hung up. I didn't go downstairs I was just too exhausted from my trip. I didn't get much rest because I didn't feel safe sleeping with portable heaters on| and having the heaters on for an extended period. Of time they begin to make crazy noises| so I had to get up cut them off wait a few minutes turn them back on. Last time I called downstairs about changing my room I was told the hotel was at capacity. I requested a manager call me back but that did not happen. This was the first issue I really had at this hotel but for me it was a big one.

Spacious comfortable room| super breakfast and perfect location for a stop over having flown in from London. Only tip would be to make sure you get the ‘South’ free shuttle bus from LAX to this hotel as this was not mentioned when we got on the shuttle or on the phone and we ended up at the wrong Embassy Suite Hotel...! Had to then Uber it to the correct location - not ideal after an 11hr flight and very tired!

I had been to many other embassy suites| I did not feel this as an upscale one. Units are old| carpets looks shabby. The worst thing was they charged for parking which is like $30 per day for two days to a totoal if 60. Car daily rental is only 30 and parking is again 30| that is very expensive.

Delicious cooked to order breakfast| friendly staff| will be back anytime we have an early LAX flight.,Nov 20| 2018,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
This is my second time at this hotel and has always been my favorite. Beautiful place| staff great and always very helpful (shout out to Edgar| Wendy| Jose for superb customer service).,Nov 20| 2018,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245
It's an airport hotel in an industrial area with nothing near it. Uber is your friend. The housekeeping was very average. The free cocktails were weak and breakfast| well| it could have been better. Probably one of the least likeable airport hotels I have stayed in. The beds were too soft and the pillows were even softer. There were ants in the bathroom. The rooms were big which caused me to rate this hotel more than it deserves.,Nov 7| 2018,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

We used this property to spend the night after our trip return from Europe. We didn't want to fight the LA traffic. They have a clean shuttle bus to pick you up from the airport. We enjoyed the happy hour. Next morning had our choice of cooked to order omelet and after breakfast we went home. Embassy Suites always a great place to stay| including this property.,Nov 5| 2018,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

We were happy here| we did get assigned a low level room| which was fine| but ground noise just outside the window was a bit difficult with our small children.

It's in a great location next to LAX for an early morning departure flight. Airport shuttle was clean and timely| but pay attention for a van that indicates Embassy Suites South as there are also Embassy Suites North shuttles that circle LAX too. I was disappointed upon my arrival that a room wasn't available| although the front desk was able to check in the person who was in front of me. They didn't offer a way to notify guests when rooms are ready. I found the room to be tastefully decorated and everything was functioning| however the back of the rolling chair in the room was broken/chipped away.  Additionally there was some sort of dark flakey debris in the bathroom sink| which was gross. The evening reception was crowded and very loud. There was not enough room to sit down in the area to partake in a beverage and the lack luster appetizers of dried veggies or build your own nachos.  Breakfast was more manageable and had a nice variety of options| but for some reason only 40 minutes into service the coffee station I used was already out of coffee. The best part of staying here was it only took 1 hour from the time I left the hotel in the morning| to reach the airport| check my luggage| and clear security at terminal B.  However I'm not so sure I'll say here the next time I have an extended layover at LAX. I shared my concern upon check out at the front desk about the desk chair and dirty sink.

My only complaint is paying $30 a day for parking at a hotel you PAID to stay in. When I made the complaint to the person at the desk they discounted it %50. I'm happy they discounted it but the hustle isn't customer friendly in my opinion. Other than that| very nice place to stay.,Aug 22| 2018,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles LAX South/El Segundo,1440 E Imperial Ave| El Segundo| CA| 90245

Everything was great| except for one thing.  The music from the wedding was quite load and went on later than expected.  Midnight seems to be an unreasonable time limit for that type of activity.
