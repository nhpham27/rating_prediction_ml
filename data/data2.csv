While quiet and conveniently located near the subway| I won't be staying here again. The biggest pros were that the internet was stable to work from the room and the air conditioning worked well. However| we did not have hot water for the majority of the stay| the TV didn't work| and the bed/pillows weren't very comfortable. A minor annoyance was that the room had lamps with outlets but they didn't work| and the other outlet locations were sparse. I was also surprised to see hospitality staff cleaning rooms without masks on.,Aug 23| 2021,3,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013

very conveniently located right above a subway station| just across the street from a park| a great restaurant (Pepolino)| and all of Soho: can't beat that.,Aug 13| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013

nice place to stay,Aug 10| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013
Certain staff members were unpleasant. Not friendly| not helpful and sort of rude. When we walked in we stood for a bit before anyone addresses us. I asked for a bandaid and was quickly told without looking ‚Äúwe are all out‚Äù. There was one very friendly man| but the other woman we interacted with was not. The room service was great and quick| but the staff at the hotel was very unpleasant.,Aug 9| 2021,3,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013

HGI in Tribeca was one of the most disappointing properties I have stayed at| I have stayed at several. The staff were unfriendly| the location on the border of nice parts of SoHo and a trashy street. The TV was old and remote barely worked| the lock on the door was broken| I could even close the door half the time with out messing with the lock on the inside for several minutes. I got placed next to a noisy supply closet where workers opened| moved things around| and slammed the door. The toilet had issues flushing| the nob on the shower to control heat was also on the fritz.  I love Hilton| but not this property.,Jul 27| 2021,2,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013

So I stayed here July 29- July 30. I didn‚Äôt feel like going home after my trip from Vegas and was going to stay here a few nights. Well guess who checked out the next morning? I did. The first room I was given seemed off it didn‚Äôt have any sanitary seals on it even after I was assured it‚Äôs cleanliness. I was told ‚Äúnobody had stayed on the 2nd floor for a while| just make sure you let the water run first so it can get warm‚Äù. That was room 228. There was a cockroach or water bug on the stomped on the floor next to the bed. I will insert a picture. WiFi wasn‚Äôt working at all even in the other room I was given| my boyfriend was pissed he couldn‚Äôt play his game. The heater/ ac unit in room 228 was not upgraded I almost threw up when it wouldn‚Äôt turn off. The sheets had stains and to be honest so did one of the towels. I was changed to room 522. It was much better everything seemed clean and it had sanitary seals on everything. Only thing I can complain was there was no WiFi in 522,Jul 31| 2020,3,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013
Alena at the front desk was beyond great! The rooms are super duper clean. The area has lots of restaurants and the subway is right outside. I would definitely recommend this hotel.,Jul 31| 2020,5,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013

The staff at the front desk| the doorman/concierge| and the waiter in the restsurant were all very friendly  and helpful. The location was also convenient -- for the subway and sites in and near Tribeca.

The location was excellent|  Very close to the corner of 6th avenue  (A.K.A. Avenue of the Americas)  and Canal Street in Manhattan.  It was a 15 minute walk to the 9-11 memorial museum and maybe twenty minutes to Greenwich Village.   The subway entrance was a few hundred feet from the hotel and was a straight shot (no transfers into Times Square and the Rockefeller center.  The subway was also a straight shot to Roosevelt in Queens with a quick express bus transfer to LaGuardia.  $6.00 cost to get to the airport sure beats the cost of a taxi.The hotel was clean and the staff friendly and helpful.   I would definitely recommend.,Jan 17| 2020,4,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013

Our recent stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca was great!  The staff were all welcoming and very helpful.  The room was small which is typical for NYC but with good amenities. Would stay here again.,Jan 15| 2020,5,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013

The room was clean which is most important to me. But the hotel was overbooked for rooms with king beds and I was given a room with two double beds| and not refunded the extra $7 I paid to reserve the king room (obviously not a huge deal but would've been nice). Overall was acceptable. I much prefer the Hilton Garden in Financial district| though.Also a random note.... The mattresses were pillow top but both were flipped so that the soft side was facing the floor..... sorta weird. Comfortable nonetheless.,Jan 6| 2020,4,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013
Location| street view| didn‚Äôt get the room expected| compensated with complimentary breakfast,Jan 6| 2020,5,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013
Property is an excellent location. Easy access to trains| food| and perfect walking distance to china town or little italy. Staff was super friendly. Far enough away from the crazy commotion of NYC but trains are so easily accessed traversing the city is easy.,Jan 4| 2020,5,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013
Clean but the beds are hard as a rock and the pillows are so flat you might as well not have a pillow at all. The coffee and amenities were not good. I ran out after one cup and then received other gross powder creamer and no stevia after that| even though it was requested.,Jan 3| 2020,3,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013
Our rating is 5 stars plus! From the moment we arrived until we left| the front desk staff was most helpful and courteous...and were more than happy to give us directions to anywhere. The room itself was nice and clean. "Pros" - (too many to mention). "Con" - the tv (which we really didn't have much time to watch): the remote was worn out and needs replaced. Also| maybe it was only the tv in our room| but the only local channels we could watch were 2 and 13. Channels 4| 7| 9| and 11| were "No Signal".   The restaurant (AOA Bar and Grill) was a bit pricey (probably normal NYC prices). We ate there twice for dinner and certainly did not leave hungry. They do feed you. However| we think their breakfast prices are too high| so we suggest you walk to Tribeca Bagels which is about a block away on the south side of Canal Street. It is a small place but is our favorite NYC restaurant.    Would we stay at Hilton Garden Inn again? YES!,Jan 3| 2020,5,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013
We stayed at this hotel after seeing a show in Newark| so we arrived around 11pm. The ladies at the front desk were absolutely exceptional. The room was perfect size for our family of 4| which is not always the norm for NYC hotels. The attached restaurant had a nice buffet breakfast. Everyone we encountered was very friendly. We were very comfortable and will be back.,Dec 31| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013
The flagpoles were right outside of our room‚Äôs windows and the didn‚Äôt seem properly secured. We constantly woke up to the flagpole shaking in the wind (much different than the sound of the flag itself blowing in the wind).The cleaning crew would let the doors slam constantly as they would re-enter the rooms they were cleaning rather than leave the door open. This happened on both days of our trip with several rooms. We couldn‚Äôt sleep and had to leave.Otherwise| the facility was clean and pleasant with great proximity to the A C E.,Dec 31| 2019,3,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013

The hotel is right next to the Canal St subway station| which was super convenient. I felt safe walking in the immediate area of the hotel. The hotel itself is pretty much what you‚Äôd expect. Smaller rooms and lobby - nothing special but does the job. Free coffee and tea in the mornings was a plus| but otherwise don‚Äôt expect anything else. I asked the front desk if they had a makeup remover wipe and they said they don‚Äôt provide anything beyond the shampoo| condition| soap| and lotion in our room. AC in our room was a bit noisy| beds were ok. Shower did get very hot. One tip I would offer future guests is to lock up your luggage and medications while you are away. Both of the people we traveled with came back to their room with an open bag in a different position/spot than how they left it.,Dec 30| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013

Great location! Room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The room was a bit small. The bathroom lighting is awful and the hair dryer was broken but even if it worked it was awful. They responded quickly and provided a replacement . They text to check in on how things are going| which is nice. Staff was very friendly and professional. The free coffee was awful!! ( decaf). I would stay again in spite of the things that weren‚Äôt wonderful.,Oct 28| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013

She didn't know that another maid cleaned the room for me at about 3 pm| but it wasn't a thorough cleaning.  She didn't wipe down the night tables| desk| and dressers or replace the napkins and stirrer packets.  It would be convenient to have a door sign that says the housekeeping service is requested.

The service was fabulous as always - we had great help with everything including arranging transportation and holding our bags for us after checkout. We did have to wait pretty late to have our room made up once| but that's it| and  the house keeping folks are always willing to communicate with us. The entire staff is always friendly. In the connecting restaurant| Dananjo - not sure on the spelling but you can find him - is spectacular at breakfast in the morning. The whole crew is super. He's a big reason why we keep coming back. The location is perfect with the subway blue lines snug up to the hotel and the red lines a couple blocks away and other lines another block or two. The neighborhood is great and just keeps betting better - great blend of new high end and local working man restaurants. Lots of cool shops. There are two nice little parks on opposite ends of the block. Lower Broadway is about 3 blocks away. Super short and easy subway ride up to all uptown sites and back down toward 9/11 Memorial| Wall Street| Battery.,May 15| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013

The service was fabulous as always - we had great help with everything including arranging transportation and holding our bags for us after checkout. We did have to wait pretty late to have our room made up once| but that's it| and  the house keeping folks are always willing to communicate with us. The entire staff is always friendly. In the connecting restaurant| Dananjo - not sure on the spelling but you can find him - is spectacular at breakfast in the morning. The whole crew is super. He's a big reason why we keep coming back. The location is perfect with the subway blue lines snug up to the hotel and the red lines a couple blocks away and other lines another block or two. The neighborhood is great and just keeps betting better - great blend of new high end and local working man restaurants. Lots of cool shops. There are two nice little parks on opposite ends of the block. Lower Broadway is about 3 blocks away. Super short and easy subway ride up to all uptown sites and back down toward 9/11 Memorial| Wall Street| Battery.,May 15| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013

This was a fantastic hotel and experience. Being this close to the Canal Street subway stops made getting around town so easy. The staff was friendly--everyone from Lisette (sp?) at check-in to the cleaning staff and handyman.

You pay what you get. The location is good but the rest is for a Hilton brand very disappointing.The staff is arrogant and does not want to engage. The Ops Manager himself should attend a training in regard to friendliness and overall hospitality. Instead of finding solutions he blames Hilton for everything. What an Ambassador. Do not send a package there or have something delivered| they will charge you recklessly with the excuse it‚Äôs mentioned on the homepage or webpage. Well| it‚Äôs not mentioned on Expedia. I got in touch with Garden Inn service center and they promised to look into this matter. Guess what| nothing happened. They do not provide water in the room. Indont recommend to drink or use the tap water over there. Instead they are forcing you to go down and get from the self service fridge a 6$ water bottle. Really? The cost of 1 bottle is most likely less than 1$ and they are charging 6$. This is very off. The room is clean but there is a certain smell. The mattress had hard pumps.Not to recommend. Pay a few bucks more somewhere else and have a good sleep and most likely better service.Sorry Hilton| this is a no go.,Feb 22| 2018,2,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013

The room was great | clean | roomy . The bed itself was awful. It was that memory foam stuff and I sunk right in. It just my personal preference for a firm mattress. Housekeeping was great very friendly. Front desk personnel all had an attitude| as if they couldn't believe people were asking them questions and bothering them.  I asked if they had laundry facilities and was told no they don't provide any laundry services which I could have sworn they Sid when booking the room. I went back up to my room to look at the website and they do provide a dryclean service.!  I went back down and confronted the man and he seemed extremely annoyed and said "you asked for a laundry facility not a service" I said either way you knew what I was asking for you could have just told me.  At least the African American concierge guy was super friendly and helpful! He was the best person there. The hotel is is very clean and in great condition. It's location is awesome  near the subway|coffee| little Italy|China town shopping I loved the location. The AOA restaurant connected to the hotel.. YUCK YUCK YUCK.food is overpriced and gross. Staff is just as rude.They serve breakfast |basically reheated frozen stuff &want $17.00 per person for breakfast. Save your $ go to the Square Diner down the street.

It's location is awesome  near the subway|coffee| little Italy|China town shopping I loved the location. The AOA restaurant connected to the hotel.. YUCK YUCK YUCK.food is overpriced and gross. Staff is just as rude.They serve breakfast |basically reheated frozen stuff &want $17.00 per person for breakfast. Save your $ go to the Square Diner down the street. Its amazing and made from scratch . Despite the rude service and bad food the hotel itself is great! Just needs a clean sweep of the staff.,Dec 24| 2017,4,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013
The bar was nice and the customer service was great. The elevators have air fresheners stuck up in the ceiling and the scents are overpowering and not pleasant. The breakfast is expensive even though they offer the same stuff as free breakfasts at other hotel chains.,Dec 23| 2017,4,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013
We had such a great time at this hotel. The staff was super friendly and very accommodating. They kept our bags after we checked out and our car for an extra day free of charge. Would definitely stay here again and recommend it to everyone! We will be back.,Nov 12| 2017,5,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013

What a gem!  I liked the modern lobby and rooms...and the internet was free| high speed and available.  Nice bedding and black out curtains contributed to a great sleep.  The adjoining restaurant has good food - highly recommend the French toast.  It came covered in fresh fruit!  The staff were really helpful - especially Mr Santos.  They arranged a ride back to the airport for a very reasonable flat rate| in a Lincoln Navigator.  We felt well treated.

The hotel staff did a wonderful job ensuring that we had a room on an upper level floor (to minimize road noise| mainly honking cars) and that we could check in a little earlier than regular times so we could drop our items off in our room and get ready for a wedding. We did use their valet parking and they had our car ready for us when we requested it. I very much appreciated the Keurig coffee maker in the room!,Aug 17| 2017,5,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013
We were on a low floor just over the street and could watch the nightlife and still see the stars. There were sheer curtains that gave us privacy while still allowing us to see the city. There was no noise| because we had the a/c on. We had a great time| this was a perfect spot to start the day - subway right outside the door. Beds were comfortable and plush with nice bedspreads.,Aug 16| 2017,5,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013

One day cleaning staff came in a ion st 8:30 AM while we were there (they did not knock).

Also| when I asked for blankets| it took an hour and I was already asleep when they arrived.,Jul 23| 2017,4,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013

The hotel's location is great to catch the subway. The entrance is right outside the hotel. The staff is very friendly.  The rooms are small but the beds are comfortable.  The restaurant has a good selection of food.  There is a convience store across the street. So we were able to get beverages and fresh fruit at the store.  There is a Dunkin Donuts down the street.  And Chinatown and Little Italy is in walking distance.  You can't go wrong with the hotel.,Jul 19| 2017,5,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013
Location of the hotel is perfect - directly next to the Canal St transit station in lower Manhattan. Literally can walk out the front door and down into the Subway. Short train ride to WTC/Battery Park| Times Square| and all other attractions in central Manhattan. Walking distance to Chinatown and Little Italy. If you drive here| be aware that parking is scarce. Nearby lots and the hotel valet are both expensive. The bus lane out front of the hotel opens up to street parking on the weekends| so we got lucky and found a spot there. The staff was friendly| helpful| and professional. Rooms were small| but nice. Bed/mattress was very lumpy and uncomfortable....my back hurt every morning when I woke up. There is a restaurant and bar attached to the lobby which was convenient. Free coffee in the morning; free citrus ice water and cookies in the afternoon/evenings. Aside from the terrible bed| it was a good stay overall. I would stay here again.,Jul 19| 2017,4,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013

We were happy with our stay here.  I would definitely consider staying in Tribeca again given ease of access to downtown| the Village| the Lower East Side and mid-town.  If you are willing to walk 5-10 blocks you don't even have to take cabs to get to some great restaurants.  Avoid the crowds of Times Square and other more obvious places to stay.,Jul 16| 2017,4,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013

The front desk staff was friendly. My only two complaints would be the bathroom had a very strong odor of urine like it hadn't been disinfected in a long time. And the carpet in room 213 had two strange stains over by the desk. But the rest of the room seemed fine. The location was good it was a nice neighborhood| right next to a subway stop. And not too far from World Trade Center| Staute of Liberty area| Chinatown| Little Italy etc.. I love NYC so if you'r like me & enjoy the city vibe you will love staying at this hotel. Free coffee & a mini fridge & microwave. Free wifi was a bit slow but it is free so what do you expect. Also it seems to be across the street from a police precinct so always police round for security if that kind of thing makes you feel better.,Jun 25| 2017,4,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013

Right when I checked in| I realized I had left my laptop on the plane at JFK.  The front desk staff immediately arranged for a car service to take me back to the airport and wait for me while I retrieved my computer| and then drive me back to the hotel.  Friendly staff| comfortable beds| decent sized rooms| good wifi connection and a location really close to Soho and the subway make this hotel a great value and a perfect choice when visiting the city.,Mar 22| 2017,5,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013

15 minutes by subway to anywhere in the city.  More neighborhood feel than the craziness of Time Square and other parts of the city.  Subway station steps from the entrance.,Mar 7| 2017,4,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013
When we arrived at first the man who was behind the counter was very friendly| polite and we joked around and laughed. He was incredibly helpful. We had boxes shipped there and the person who got them for us was also very helpful and nice. Our stay at the hotel was a big pleasure and we definitely will go back next year and enjoy it again. Overall an awesome experience. There is also a restaurant and bar at the hotel and the food was nice and all employees were extremely friendly. One of the friendliest hotels I have been in NYC! ‚ô•,Mar 6| 2017,5,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013
The bed I slept on was not that great| I sank into a big hole.,Jan 30| 2017,5,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013
The location is very central to very many attractions. The staff went above and beyond to accommodate our experience. The gave us an early check-in and put out hot chocolate instead of coffee for our little ones. They were very personal and remembered our names. If you have noisy neighbors you will be able to hear them but that only happened one of the 4 nights we were there and we were so tired from all the things we got to do that day we fell right asleep. For the price| excellent experience.,Jan 30| 2017,5,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013
Great location with subway station right outside the door. Staff was very friendly and helpful| especially the concierge. Although once we tried to get room service and they never answered the phone (but I think that was actually the restaurant downstairs). Room was comfortable but it could have used a new shower head| or better pressure. The "pantry" downstairs had basic snacks but not as extensive as some I've seen| and no beer or wine (but bar/restaurant in the building).

Lesson learned. If you book a room with jacuzzi| CALL IN ADVANCE TO MAKE SURE THEY CLEAN IT THOROUGHLY! Almost everything great| except I paid extra for a room with whirlpool bath| and the jets were full of dirt| dead skin| hair| debris. You would think| that specific room-type| the management would ensure the highlight of the room is spectacularly spotless.

Overall good. We have stayed here before| so this was a deliberate choice and based on room size. All staff were friendly and obliging. Some details need attention. Over the holiday period the house keeping staff appeared really pushed. Restocking the beverages seemed a fairly random process| but this is nothing in the scale of things. More important was that the rest rooms in the reception area shared with the AOA restaurant were in a poor condition - not a good impression to create.,Dec 29| 2016,4,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013

This is a very clean| neat Hilton brand hotel located in lower Manhattan area. Service could be further improved. Pros: Comfortable bed| the firmness of the mattress is about right - not too hard and not too soft. Room is spacious compared to some other chain hotels in Manhattan area. Location is tourism-friendly| several subway stops are around. Cons: They seem do not provide free toothbrush and toothpaste for travelers who forgot to bring their own. No free bottle water in room.,Dec 27| 2016,5,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013
Great location| really clean rooms. Guy in the lobby was awesome with us on the last day sorting our luggage. Guy on the desk when we arrived was short and of little help which was a shame. Only major downer was the heater and fridge in the room sounded like jet engines.

This hotel is in a fantastic location which allowed us to easily explore Chinatown| Little Italy| Greenwich etc but with a subway stop right outside the front door we were also easily able to visit Central Park| Times Square etc in a short 15 min ride.The hotel staff were all excellent. Friendly and helpful to a fault. The only downside was how expensive the attached bar/restaurant was but those kind of prices are not unusual in New York where everything seemed incredibly expensive compared to other places we have visited in the States. I would very much recommend this hotel to those who wanted to see more of New York beyond the neon and tourist gift shops.

Bra standard och bra service. F√∂r en familj med tv√• barn i 11- och 13-√•rs√•ldern √§r det ett utm√§rkt val i en sp√§nnande del av NYC och med goda kommunikationer till alla delar av Manhattan och smidig f√§rd till och fr√•n Newark. Frukosten kan man dock v√§lja bort till f√∂rm√•n f√∂r n√•gon av de m√•nga diners eller delis som finns i n√§rheten.,Mar 1| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013

Top locatie. Metro van JFK stopt letterlijk onder het Hotel. Dus zeer gemakkelijk voor Metro in NY. Vriendelijk personeel en veel leuke restaurants in de buurt. 10 minuten lopen naar Chinatown en Little Italy. 20 minuten lopen naar WTC.,Feb 22| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013

Das Hotel liegt mitten in Tribecca einem kleinen und feinen Viertel in New York. Die Anreise erfolgt sehr einfach mit der E-Linie vom Flughafen JFK.Das Hotel ist sauber und klassisch amerikanisch.

premesso che siamo a New York e gli standard sono completamente diversi dai nostri europei| complessivamente l'hotel ha un ottimo rapporto qualit√†/prezzo. Inoltre siamo stati per la settimana di capodanno e i prezzi medi| a Manhattan| erano da capogiro. Considerato che ce la siamo cavata con 690‚Ç¨ a testa per 9 notti| a capodanno| direi che l'hotel √® stato all'altezza delle aspettative. La camera era sufficientemente grande| con bagno grande e moderno. Letto oversized (queen enorme) e tutto decisamente comodo. A leggere certe recensioni mi chiedo a cosa siano abituati. L'hotel √® ben chiaramente descritto come un hotel "essenziale"| per chi vuole spendere poco e stare in un hotel che non sia una bettola. Gli standard di New York sono altissimi e i prezzi sono adeguati. A conti fatti| questo hotel vale la spesa. L'unica pecca| se proprio vogliamo essere puntigliosi| √® l'area un p√≤ povera di servizi. Ma appena fuori l'hotel c'√® la fermata della metro ACE (blu) e| attraversando la strada| c'√® la fermata di Canal St. (rossa). A 500 metri c'√® l'area che porta a Little Italy e China Town dove trovare ristoranti| negozi| e qualunque cosa cerchiate...

L'hotel √® ben chiaramente descritto come un hotel "essenziale"| per chi vuole spendere poco e stare in un hotel che non sia una bettola. Gli standard di New York sono altissimi e i prezzi sono adeguati. A conti fatti| questo hotel vale la spesa. L'unica pecca| se proprio vogliamo essere puntigliosi| √® l'area un p√≤ povera di servizi. Ma appena fuori l'hotel c'√® la fermata della metro ACE (blu) e| attraversando la strada| c'√® la fermata di Canal St. (rossa). A 500 metri c'√® l'area che porta a Little Italy e China Town dove trovare ristoranti| negozi| e qualunque cosa cerchiate... Basta fare una passeggiatina e vi ritrovate nel "traffico" New Yorkese.,Jan 12| 2018,4,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013
goede bedden| leuke ligging- tegen het zakendistrict aan en het trendy Soho,Jan 11| 2018,4,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013
Hotellin huoneissa ei ole mit√§√§n vikaa ja hotellilta l√∂ytyy kuntosali jossa saa hien pintaan. Hotelli ei sin√§ns√§ sijaitse kauniilla paikalla| mutta siit√§ k√§velee nopeasti Tribecan mukaville kaduille ja Sohoon. Metropys√§kki aivan vieress√§. Aamiaisen pystyi ostamaan erikseen alakerran hotellista| mik√§ oli ok| mutta huomattavasti paremmat aamiaiset saa l√§hialueen ravintoloista.,Jan 10| 2018,4,Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca,39 Avenue of the Americas| New York| NY| 10013
