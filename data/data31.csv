Hotel stay was great close to almost everything only issue was $50 self parking.,Aug 18| 2021,4,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

Not much,Aug 18| 2021,4,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108
The customer service at check-in and checkout was the worst I have ever experienced in my 10 years of being a Hilton Honors member. The staff were rude and impolite for the entire stay| it was absolutely ridiculous. During checkout they tried to charge me for two parking spaces while I repeatedly said I only had one car. I had to ask three times for the copy of the invoice for my second room. Finally| the attendant threw the invoice at me| turned around and started trash talking to the other attendants directly in front of me. Would strongly recommend not booking a stay at this hotel unless you want to be bullied by the staff.,Aug 18| 2021,1,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

The room was nice| it was roomy| comfortable| nice size TV and relatively quiet. The staff was really friendly and helpful.On the down side| the bathroom had a sliding door that was heavy and dificult to move| no towel bar| no exhaust fan. The room didn't have a refrigerator or microwave and the trash bins were pretty small. This is all pretty nitpicky stuff| but for the price we paid it was acceptable.,Aug 17| 2021,3,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108
Amenities and staff not all that great..,Aug 17| 2021,3,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108
We had a great time.  The hotel is right in the middle of everything.  Great access to get anywhere.  The concierge at the front desk was amazing (the gentleman with salt and pepper hair and glasses).. He gave us great directions and helped us find good restaurants to eat and places to shop. When we were going out for an adventure he made sure we had water.  He always greeted us with a wonderful smile and always wished us a good day.  We will be staying here again on our next trip.  Great people all around.,Aug 17| 2021,5,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

The bathroom has a sliding door that didn't had a look (barn door) and it was kind of see through| so my youth children felt uncomfortable using it.  It didn't even had a fan| so they made a deal not to go #2  in there and they had to use the lobby restroom.  Parking is super expensive. We paid $50 for the one on their premises and $30 for one that is in front of the hotel.   I wish i had taken a picture of the restroom door so i can post it in here.,Aug 16| 2021,3,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

Great hotel but parking was crazy expensive. We paid $51 to self park!,Aug 15| 2021,4,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108
The hotel was close to Chinatown and downtown. Convenient to walk around and check out local foods. Public transit is easy to get. Front of the house and customer care was wonderful. The room was upgraded. Just 2 minor things that was missing. One I wish there was a small refrigerator. 2nd I wanted housekeeping to clean the room. Even though I mentioned it durning my check in. Needless to say it never happened. All in all it was great to stay at the Hilton,Aug 15| 2021,5,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

Amazing,Aug 9| 2021,5,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108
Room smelled very badly of cigarette smoke (worrying during COVID). Couldn't offer us a room with the same booking criteria (high floor with bay view - didn't offer discount for taking a room without a view of the bay). Sprayed room with room refresher. When the smoke smell persisted we asked for room to be refreshed the next morning and lobby said "we'll have to see" if they can do it. Made us doubt the cleanliness of the room during COVID times. Room at end of hall so we could hear elevator ding all night| as well as traffic below (despite being on 16th floor)| and couple above us having sex. Not a restful or enjoyable stay. Many other hotels in the area to choose from. Won't stay with Hilton again and would not recommend anyone else staying here.,Aug 9| 2021,2,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

Right in the middle of Chinatown and North Beach.  Need to be patient during rush hours for the elevators.

Upon check in| I was given a room different from what I had originally chosen. After seeing I was right next to elevator and ice machine| I asked to be loved but front desk agent looked irritated| “I should’ve never checked you in early.” That night the rooms around me kept slamming doors and being disruptive. I called front desk to see if they could do something| supposedly security came up but it went on all night. Upon check out| when I asked why I was seeing two additional fees| instead of calmly explaining to me| the agent kept cutting my questions off. Worst hotel stay I’ve had with Hilton.

Our stay was great! We had an AMAZING view given to us but the only problem with the view is that the windows were extremely dirty :( so you can’t get the full view experience. The vending machines steal your money most of the time but the staff was nice enough to give us drinks to replace the money we missed out on. Housekeeping came every day were were there and picked up trash made the bed and replaced towels and we can confidently say the room smelled and looked amazing Everytime we would come back from a long day. Warning: when you pay the deposit you don’t get CLOSE to as much as you paid. Our deposit was $200. And I received $90 on the way out. This needs to be fixed or taken care of because a deposit is supposed to be given back in full not half.

I also requested a city view and i got An alley view. Meh.,Jul 24| 2021,4,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108
It was ok. Paid for premium view and didn’t really get a high floor. Parking is expensive and,Jul 24| 2021,4,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108
The customer service was great| I’m very disappointed at how the rooms look. They are very old looking| the bathroom floor looked really gross and the room has the worst city view ever. The room was really small too. For the area I expected a better looking room. However I loved where the hotel was placed. It is within walking distance of everything which is very convenient.,Jul 24| 2021,3,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

I don’t recommend you stay at this time until there is a mandate to wear a mask in order to get in the elevators.

I liked the location only. The bathroom stunk like urine.  A cleaning lady cleaned it real quick on the second day we were there| but the smell was still there. The water pressure to the shower was so bad. The water barely came out.   The restroom had no fan and was so humid and sticky in there. There was no microwave or refrigerator. No breakfast| and no free parking.That would have been nice and so worth staying there.,Jul 5| 2021,3,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

The towels in the bathroom have a perfume smell and it was wet when we first entered. My first hand guess was  the towel was not cleaned and the housekeeper use perfume to cover the smell.,Jul 4| 2021,3,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

We had a two queen bedroom with no clean towel and a tiny room| and when we asked the cleaning lady to have a towel| she ignored us and finally talked to the front desk about that. They charge us over 50 dollars for parking for each night which did not mention on hotel’s website. The area around was not a good area too. I do not recommend it to anybody.,Jul 4| 2021,2,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108
No room service| no house keeping| no anything. You might as well stay at a motel 6. You’ll probably be treated better. I wasn’t informed anywhere that the hotel is running at a bare minimum.

Place is old and needs updating.  Asian maid staff a bit RUDE; especially to other folks of color.  They need work on politeness and flexibility-and yes| we realize it’s hard work.

Although our room door failed to open because of the door battery (we learned later) and maintenance fixed it eventually| we waited too long for the maintenance guy to get up.

The property is definitely on the old side| which explains why the rate was reasonable compared to very high rates around the rest of the city during this weekend. The walls are paper thin and I heard every noise and conversation in the next room. However| the central location served me and my family well during our stay.

There are bottles of water in the room| in Air bnbs these are almost always free| at the Hilton a single bottle of water will run you $8. Just a blatant scam.The room had no mini-fridge or microwave.

I had a not very pleasant experience| they put me in a tiny room next to the elevator| every time the elevator was used ie all the time| horrible sound and the walls vibrating| impossible to sleep| in the reception ( front desk) a horrible old dirty carpet,Jun 17| 2021,2,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108
Front desk employees were not very welcoming when I arrived at midnight.  They were more interested in conversing with each other  before finally acknowledging our presence. The bathroom had hair in the tub and scratchy towels. Bring your own shampoo| conditioner| and lotion unless you like smelling like cheap perfume. The walls were thin…I could hear the people next door as well as them taking a shower from 2-3am!!!! The Hilton needs to invest in deep cleaning the sofa cushions in the room and carpets throughout especially in the main hallways. As I was walking in the long corridor to get to my room I was second guessing my option to stay here. The only redeeming quality of this dated| run-down hotel was the beautiful view of the city. I will not be returning.,Jun 17| 2021,3,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108
The view from the 24th floor was amazing! One of the best views of Alcatraz| Coit tower| and the pier. The room itself is outdated| definitely needed a window that opens up to let in some fresh air.,Jun 16| 2021,4,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

The hotel was just alright. I think it needs a major overhaul. The place doesn't feel or look clean. The only place that was clean was the bed. The chairs had major stains.

Our room view was disappointing but the room was clean and beds were comfortable. The bathroom floor was in need of repair and needs a deep cleaning of the tile grout in the shower. No ventilation in the bathroom for the shower steam but great water pressure and temperature. The staff were all friendly. The location was in the heart of Chinatown which turned out to be very nice. The locals were kind and the homeless in that area didn’t bother us like they did in some of the other areas.,Jun 12| 2021,4,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108
Parking was a little confusing| very small right space and Maps brought us in at a strange entrance. Lobby and Front Desk was nice| however I only reserved for a 1 night| 1 Room - Double/ two bed for $187 (roughly). The man gave me cards for two separate rooms for $193 each! which got fixed up quickly| but don’t know why 2 rooms were reserved. Elevator| hallways and bedrooms were great and clean! Got a fantastic view of Coit Tower. Bathroom smelt a little of cleaning supplies but everything else was good besides a broken fixture. It was me and my friends first time booking a hotel in the city so it’s all learning experience. Elevators recquired key card| alongside lobby restrooms. Parking is additional $42 for us that night. Overall a pretty good/decent stay!,Jun 12| 2021,2,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

This Hilton hotel property has great rooms with great views and it also has rooms that are average| i have stayed at this hilton property 3 times and this stay for memorial day werkend was not so pleasant|  the room had a foul smell| and the couch set was stained real bad| no bath robes| carpet was stained and smelled foul. The linens on the beds were dingy and the comforters definently need to be replaced| shower curtain was just ok.

This is a run down hotel. Hilton should take their name off of it. It's beat down. Dirty sofa in room. Carpets not clean| Windows dirty. It seems like an ill maintained aging hotel.

Didn't know what to expect when we got there to check in.  The staff was nice.  Had not anticipate that parking was a such luxury. Charging $36.00 plus tax to park per night leave a bad taste. When we got to our room & looked around| seeing that they want to charge another  $8.00 for bottle of water was in very poor taste| not only that but the cover to there heating & air was laying on the floor. Not the best experience I have ever encountered. I can't say I would recommend this kind of service to anyone.

The staff was super friendly| rooms were clean and big and super comfy| it’s right on the cusp of north beach and China town (all walking distance) which was perfect for me! Also| there was street parking at night outside the hotel. Will definitely stay here for my next visit.

Bathroom was terrible| shower water was flowing out. Every-time we took a bath| the bathroom floor was all wet. No refrigerator in room| bathroom door kept dislocating| less number of power sockets. Overall property condition was not on par. For parking charges| we ended up paying double the amount than promised over call. Huge miscommunication on their part.

This has got to be the worst stay in a hotel ever.  When booking in Expedia| it is described that there is concierge and luggage storage service.  Infact| there is not.  When I complained to the manager| he kicked us out.  I told him it was not 11am| so we would stay until our checkout time.  Staff are not only unhelpful| but are outright rude.

The staff was outstanding our entire stay. The policy of no longer storing baggage for guests resulted in ruining our entire last day if our trip. We checked out at noon but our flight wasn't departing until 7PM| so having to keep our bags with us for the entire day made it to where we had to sit in the lounge with no services at the hotel. The room with 16 screens on the wall wasn't even tuned to any TV channel so sitting there fir hours without even a drink available is very poor service. While it is not the staff's fault| it is management making these decisions that should create an alternative or at minimum notify guests of this lack of service upon checkin.,Apr 17| 2021,4,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

Disappointed with the room view for the price. The bed comforter was old. Pretty dusty. And the hall way smelled like MJ. I had my daughter with me. And the elevators walls and doors| not clean. Parking garage walls pretty dirty. Sticky floor. Getting out of my car. Gum got stuck to my shoes. It smelled like urine. Disappointed knowing that this was a Hilton Hotel. Front desk personal was great but the front lobby guy was very forgetful. Kept on questioning if my daughter and I were guest at the hotel. But he would let everyone else go by without a problem. He would literally follow us to the elevator. And he even follow us to our floor at one point. Would I stay here again? No.,Apr 6| 2021,3,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

Disappointed with the room view for the price. The bed comforter was old. Pretty dusty. And the hall way smelled like MJ. I had my daughter with me. And the elevators walls and doors| not clean. Parking garage walls pretty dirty. Sticky floor. Getting out of my car. Gum got stuck to my shoes. It smelled like urine. Disappointed knowing that this was a Hilton Hotel. Front desk personal was great but the front lobby guy was very forgetful. Kept on questioning if my daughter and I were guest at the hotel. But he would let everyone else go by without a problem. He would literally follow us to the elevator. And he even follow us to our floor at one point. Would I stay here again? No.,Apr 6| 2021,3,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

the room had cut toenails on the floor of the bathroom and hair.  It made me doubt that they cleaned as well as they say.  There still is no restaurant service available even though San Francisco seems to be open for service at other eating places.  Had to walk a couple of blocks to get coffee.  Had to wait in line for 15 minutes to sign in on arrival only used two of the three check in.The elevators took sometimes 10 minutes to get to your floor only to be full when they finally appeared.,Mar 31| 2021,3,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

Before you book| think twice!!I thought the Hilton name guaranteed a certain standard when it comes to hotels| I was wrong.-Rude Staff at check in- No ability to pay with Apple Pay/ contactless- Facilities are dated and in need of renovations- Elevators crowded and take forever- Bathtub easily overflows and spills water everywhere- On a positive note| the location is acceptable| but there are other hotels in the area.

Hard to find options for stairs when theres a bunch of people waiting for elevator with limited capacity. Room smells like someone smoke on it (maybe I accidentally booked a smoking room even if I tried to make sure I did not). No fridge and microwave in room unfortunately. Room does not get cool enough even if  I lowered temperature as low as we can (might get fix if I complain but only stayed 2 nights that we did not want to be too demanding) Staff were nice though. Overall - its ok. Close to everything I which is great,Mar 25| 2021,2,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108
The hotel was decent but not very clean and what upset me the most was when I purchased the hotel it said that there would be amenities and when I got to the hotel the said they’re wouldn’t give us any. No free wifi was the one thing I needed the most,Mar 24| 2021,3,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

The hotel was in a nice area. What I didn't like was when we arrived they started by telling us what was not available. No house keeping or cleaning of the room. if we needed new towels we could get them from the front desk. No room service| restaurant  or bar service the gym was closed. The day before leaving i was informed they did not have a shuttle service to the airport| this cost me another 50.00. with all the changes we did not get a reduced rate.,Mar 15| 2021,2,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

This was the most disgusting hotel I have ever stayed in. I booked a 'hilton' because it's reputation is that of a certain level of standard but I might as well have stayed in a motel down the road. The rooms and hallways were dirty with stains everywhere and smells of cigarettes| the people in the room next to me were throwing a party during covid lockdown - I had to change rooms 3 times in 2 days and ultimately left before my stay was over because anything else was better than this hotel.

Pretty good hotel! Although it looked like the floor we were on was under construction for paint repair| it was no bother to us. Amenities were closed due to Covid.

Upon returning to the room from dinner| the AC unit was left on to cool the very hot room off while we were enjoying dinner| it was and still is extremely hot. At this point I have had enough and I have contacted the hotel and a gentlemen was very attentive and sent a fan to my room but was unable to credit me due to my booking with you.

I also contacted hotels.com and the representative was very rude and unwillingly to try and resolve the problems. The only thing he said he would do was if i left then and there they would give me a full refund. I declined due to the fact that it qas 9pm and i drove 2 hours to get there.

Their is an amazing Italian restaurant a street over called  Magia Tutti which is a hidden treasure!,Oct 13| 2020,4,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108
Convenient location but I felt like it could have been cleaner. Found an old towel stuffed behind the hair dryer that was missed when they cleaned Water pressure in the shower was terrible.,Oct 13| 2020,3,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108
Booked this hotel because the deposit was only $50 per night while other hotels around the area were over $100. The beds were really comfortable and the location is great. Beware the parking is $60 a night and the elevators take forever since there is a 2 person per elevator rule so there is always a line .,Oct 12| 2020,3,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

The room was very nice but the view was partially blocked by a dirty window. Paid parking is ridiculous too. The other thing I didn’t like is how the front desk receptionist charged my credit card a deposit. He didn’t even ask which card I wanted to use.

- The shower is the worst I ever seen in a hotel.- The room's windows were moaning. Not dirty from the last rain. They had dirt stuck from months ago.- There was a rotten fruit under the bed.- I asked if they could refill the coffee pods (they leave you 2 with the machine in your room) and they ONLY brought me the pods. If I need more coffee it's because I also used all the cups| stirrers and sugar.-,Oct 10| 2020,3,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108
Overall it’s a nice a hotel for the price (esp right now with covid). Location is great!! The hotel rooms can use some reno and updating like the walls were pretty thin and elevator was very inefficient. Elevator sign says only 2 ppl at a time| it would stop by a lot of floors before reaching to the level you want and sometimes the elevator would just go up without you being able to press the number and then have to wait to come back down.,Oct 10| 2020,4,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

The hotel room itself was fine| but none of the staff cares about COVID. They allow guests to roam around the lobby/hallways and enter elevators without a mask. There's a security guard at the door| but they never enforced anything. Additionally| they have a 2 person per elevator "rule" that was never observed. Guests would barge into elevators with 6+ people| many of them without masks. Overall a pretty disappointing and scary experience as a first time traveler during this COVID pandemic. I'm pretty sure the way this Hilton is operating during COVID isn't legal.,Oct 9| 2020,1,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

The lady at the front desk was super great when we got there and then when we got back at around 11 pm our neighbors called a noise complaint on me and my girlfriend for talking| talking!!! Then someone from staff came up to our room and told us if we didn’t quiet down they would kick us out. So we lowered our voices and our neighbor banged on the wall telling us to shut up. We ended up just having to go to sleep because we were scared about being “kicked out” i’m furious i’ll never stay here again,Oct 9| 2020,3,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

Pot smoking people in Lobby| clientele has changed for the worse and poor management which is allowing the Hilton Brand to suffer tremendously,Sep 22| 2020,1,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108
The property is in a convenient location for tourism of the downtown areas Which is a plus. However| the parking garage are in the lower basement for hotel guests and there’s a heavy odor of gas/exhaust that is nauseating. The hotel does not offer housekeeping services until checkout due to Covid which is unacceptable. There were trash left in the hallways from hotel guests for housekeeping to pickup that stayed there the whole 4 days we were there. The rates should be reduced to lower rates if guests are not receiving clean sheets and housekeeping services during their entire stay.,Sep 22| 2020,1,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

Nice hotel at a fair price and great location downtown. Be prepared to pay for parking $60+ a night. Or parking directly across is half the price.

It was sub par. Lamps in my room had dried fluids on them. One elevator had no service so we had to use the stairs twice down 5 floors. The worst part is that there was no refrigerator!

If you’re looking for a spacious room hotel| this is not your option| the room felt extremely cramped. There was no fridge in the rooms| no microwave| basically the room is only for sleep.

We were just visiting for a couple of days to get out of the house. Check in was fast and easy. We were offered a late check out with out asking. This was a nice touch and set a good mood for the rest of the stay. The hotel is in a great location next to Chinatown with lots of parking. The hotel is walking distance to Union Square| North Beach| Pier 39| and Fisherman’s Wharf. Due to Covid| the pool and gym are closed and room cleaning is by request. Masks and social distancing are enforced. Some of the guest seem a little uptight about Covid. My suggestion would be if you are super worried about it| stay home. The staff are polite and professional and I’m glad they are here for us during this time. Things are limited in the city due to Covid. But it’s a nice time to see the city without the crowds. Eating outside at North Beach was great. I definitely recommend the Hilton Financial District and a short stay in SF.,Aug 31| 2020,4,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

I like the property was in the middle of downtown| very close to Chinatown. For a 4 star hotel I was charged a 4 star price for very little to meager accommodations. Example| no valet|no bellboy|no microwave in room| however there was a "common " one in the bar area| 1 microwave for guests in a 26 floor hotel|not very sanitary and a very long line to wait and use it. The bar and restaurant was closed. No fridge for my insulin. The morning of my check in Expedia sent me an email effectively upon my check in that SF has a shelter in place order| so I was able to check in early. Being on the 18th floor it was quite warm| as I had a bay view. First you can see half of the bay and the other half of SF community college across the street| poor view. As I began to unpack and freshen up| I noticed the towel rack mounted to the interior wall of the shower| which also seemed very unsanitary to me as well. I then turned the AC on and it barely blew any air. I notified maintenance and they stated the compressor went out and needed to be replaced. I then had to spend the afternoon in the lobby without enjoying any of the hotels features| art and amenities as most were closed and I would be violating the shelter in place order if I left the hotel| also due to the fires the quality of the air was unhealthy to be out in and with covid as well. Room 1801 was located right near 4 elevators and right next to a vending machine and ice machine|  which caused an unpleasant sleep.,Aug 26| 2020,1,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

This hotel should be embarrassed to call itself a Hilton. The front desk staff was so nice| however the hotel itself was not worth the Hilton name. The building was not the worst I’ve seen| but the room| and the halls to the rooms were disgusting!

This hotel needs to be updated the hallways look dirty with lots of stains on the carpet the room was not cleaned the bathroom mirror had old water stains on the mirror like it had not been cleaned.

Where do i begin? Well| ill start and end with the elevators. 20+minute wait to get on one!! 25 to 30min from the time you get on till the time you actually make it to the front desk!! Unacceptable!!!! We were on the 11th floor and it was faster to take the stairs. Both days and at all times!!  The 3 times we had to take them| 25+ min to get down!!!,Aug 10| 2020,3,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

Great location| friendly staff| easy in and out for parking| Uber and airport shuttle. Hotel lobby was very clean.

The location of the Hilton Financial District was great.

There are 4 elevators servicing 27 floors; always a line to get on from lobby and longer wait on floors to get down. Can easily hear kids stomping and talking in hallways; including overhead/through walls - especially if they let the door slam shut. Side neighbor door slamming shook our wall with TV.

We got spot hero parking for $24 right around the corner so don't pay the $65 they want at the hotel.  Nice bar and gorgeous lobby.  Hallways are nice.  TV is big and easy to navigate.

Very cold and wet in the city for my 2 day trip| my first nite was not a problem but the second day my room heater was not working properly. I let the front desk know about the problem around 8 pm| I told the young man that I would be leaving the hotel for about 3 hours. I was told   A technician will be available to look into the problem while I was gone .  However on my returned about 11:15 PM the situation was not resolved |  I called the front desk again and someone  was sent to my room around 11:40 PM .  The technician suggested that he needed to replace the unit| I could either stay in the room or move to another room|  I chose to move into another room since replacing the unit was going to take I thought up to two hours .  The technician on duty was pleasant and sincere but moving to another room at midnight is not something no one wants to do| especially if this matter could’ve been taken care of before I return to the room .   This matter should have been resolved before I left the hotel| it only took the technician 10 minutes to determine what needed to be done !  The room I transferred to was not as good as the original room. The  technician gave me a free breakfast coupon but I really feel this is very insufficient for the inconvenience I was spacey | plus this should have been a  priority earlier in the evening!  Upon checkout| I explain my dissatisfaction but because the room was paid for by a third-party already| she didn’t care about my   Inconvenience ! 😠🙁,Dec 1| 2019,2,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

Very cold and wet in the city for my 2 day trip| my first nite was not a problem but the second day my room heater was not working properly. I let the front desk know about the problem around 8 pm| I told the young man that I would be leaving the hotel for about 3 hours. I was told   A technician will be available to look into the problem while I was gone .  However on my returned about 11:15 PM the situation was not resolved |  I called the front desk again and someone  was sent to my room around 11:40 PM .  The technician suggested that he needed to replace the unit| I could either stay in the room or move to another room|  I chose to move into another room since replacing the unit was going to take I thought up to two hours .  The technician on duty was pleasant and sincere but moving to another room at midnight is not something no one wants to do| especially if this matter could’ve been taken care of before I return to the room .   This matter should have been resolved before I left the hotel| it only took the technician 10 minutes to determine what needed to be done !  The room I transferred to was not as good as the original room. The  technician gave me a free breakfast coupon but I really feel this is very insufficient for the inconvenience I was spacey | plus this should have been a  priority earlier in the evening!  Upon checkout| I explain my dissatisfaction but because the room was paid for by a third-party already| she didn’t care about my   Inconvenience ! 😠🙁,Dec 1| 2019,2,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

This Hilton was smack dab right between Financial District and Chinatown. The room we had was facing the city and we can even see the Koit tower. We loved that mostly everywhere we wanted to go was walking distance. The room and furniture was nicely furnished| you can tell it needs some work but nothing too drastic in my opinion since we were in and out of our room mostly. Concierge was very friendly and they would even check in on us time to time to make sure our stay is doing great. Its a great location| will most likely book another time with family.,Nov 18| 2019,5,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

Staff at check-in was courteous but in such a phony way that it was hard to miss. In fact| we ended up getting a room next to the elevator shaft that was way too loud.

This hotel was comfortable| clean| and in a safe area. The bed was comfortable and the location was just a short cab ride away from Union Square. There were some things I did not like. For example| we waited 10 minutes or more for the elevator and it was sometimes full by the time it got to us| so we had to wait even longer. We were able to use the stairs and were on a lower floor| but I can only imagine being on floor 18 you may wait a really long time. The room was nice enough| but the wallpaper was peeling off in places and the bathroom had no soap holder so you had to put the soap on the ground. Between paying $60 to park overnight and the price of the hotel| I would have thought it wouldn't have had any issues. Overall| it was just ok and I won't be staying here again.,Oct 29| 2019,3,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108
Had problems with pricing when I first checked in but the front desk quickly fixed it and they were very friendly! The people that stayed next to us were very noisy! And $65 for parking for guest is ridiculous! ur view was amazing and there were plenty of restaurants nearby! Another downside is we had to walk 8 floors to get to our room cause the elevator was slow and we were tired of waiting for it!,Oct 28| 2019,3,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

Even though we are Hilton members| we had some real issues with hooking on to the WiFi| which was annoying.  Otherwise a pretty good stay.  Close to China town and a nice walk to pier 5.,Oct 2| 2019,4,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108
Ivan the Great checked us in with enthusiasm and excellence.  The bellhop went above and beyond.  Great location steps from the heart of Chinatown.,Oct 2| 2019,4,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

They gave us a room with a barely functioning act| bathroom door that didn't slide all the way closed and was super hard to even open or close| the bathroom was very worn with rust and scratches everywhere| the tub looked questionable| and the pillows and sheets literally felt like plastic.

The room was pretty small| but really well maintained.  The staff was very friendly.  We ordered room service and it was delivered very promptly and was delicious.  The only complaint I have about my stay is that the windows were absolutely filthy.  They afforded a nice view of the financial district| but the dirty windows detracted from it.

Overall our stay was nice| the hotel is located right in the middle of financial district and china town| close to major attractions and transportation accessible. Few thing I wished I would've known before booking our stay: WIFI not available if you book through a 3rd party. You have to be a member of Hilton honors and book through them| same goes for complimentary water bottles| if booked through a 3rd part they cost $3/16 oz| which is kind of funny having a big sign on each bottle. There were a number of conferences during our stay in the hotel| so the elevators were always packed| and it is more aimed to a business type of stay.,Sep 10| 2019,4,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

The parking was an extortionate $55 per day however directly opposite in a rival car park it was $20 cheaper.We chose the Hilton for its name and supposed reputation however this experience has sealed the deal on never staying in a Hilton again. $200 per night would have been better spent at an independent hotel.,Aug 22| 2019,1,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

The valet staff wasn’t rude but pretty close to it. Neither of the guys that helped me had a good attitude. I attempted to put my bags in my car and they gave me the keys and told me to go look for it instead of pulling the car up for me. That’s the first time I have ever had a valet do that. Also the car wasn’t in the assigned spot so I had to search for it.Overall the hotel was amazing and beautiful.

The room was really clean and nice| but the area wasn't the greatest. Still close to a lot of things.

Staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful. We called in an issue with there being no hot water in our shower right before stepping out to dinner. They called us back and gave us a room upgrade as their remedy to the issue. Even the bartenders were friendly when we visited the bar for happy hour. Rooms  are not generously large but neither are they tight by SF standards. Great location adjacent to Chinatown and North Beach area.

Get to the hotel sort of late and check in. Finally figure out how to get the automatic blinds down (took a while; it wasn’t apparent how to do it. Again| it was late and I was tired). Wake up early because the maintenance team thought it would be a good idea to start using a drill RIGHT NEXT DOOR before 7AM.

For us| Hilton has a certain name and reputation. For the cost paid it was well below expectation. I could hear a baby crying in a room a few doors down| the hot water and shower pressure were underwhelming. And up on the 7th floor I did not expect to be able to hear the traffic as clear as I did.

For us| Hilton has a certain name and reputation. For the cost paid it was well below expectation. I could hear a baby crying in a room a few doors down| the hot water and shower pressure were underwhelming. And up on the 7th floor I did not expect to be able to hear the traffic as clear as I did. Was an old building| but really needs an upgrade or loose the Hilton name,May 31| 2019,2,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

Executive floors bayside offer fabulouse panoramic views which I highly recommend. The Executive Lounge is a nice added touch that comes with Executive Floor rooms and includes breakfast and hor d'oeuvres and beer & wine on the evening. The beds are fabulously comfortable (at home I use a NovaFoam mattress topper). Property is older| but well located in the financial district. Rooms are well maintained and while visually they indicate they are likely due for an updating renovation in the not too distant future they are still very appealing.,Mar 17| 2019,4,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

We were on the 14th floor on a Friday night| and could hear everything happening outside our room. Some folks were having a party that extended from their room and into the corridor and others had loud phone calls being made. Some time in the wee hours of the night a car alarm went off somewhere in the neighborhood and it felt as if we were right on top of the car. Also| the pillows were meh. During my 3 night stay| I found out that I could keep the fan for the heating unit permanently ON to keep the noise under control. Spoke to other people in the hotel who said they had a quiet experience in upper floors - we were on the 14th floor. The view of the bay from our Bay View room was partial| mostly facing the building across but still decent. But the hotel itself| is in a great location and is easy to get to everywhere else in SF. I hardly noticed other people with children and did not find this to be a place catering to families.

We enjoyed our stay. Beds were comfortable. Staff were friendly. Although I wasn't happy on a bottle of wine I had bought there. There was a certain of wine I was wanting and the bar didn't carry it. So staff suggested another. Saying it was similar. So we brought it to our room to enjoy. It was the most awful tasting wine ever! It wasn't even close to the one we had wanted. So that was a disappointment. The bottle went to waste and our money. Staffs needs to know their wine better!!,Feb 4| 2019,4,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

First of all they stuck me on the 23 floor---Im not particularly found of heights but thats the room I got stuck with and I was right off the elevators  heard the elevator NOISE all night long---not pleasant...no frig in room and the coffee pot was dumb--pluses --convenient for where I needed to go| clean room and fresh towels---NO ROBE--I'm not too picky about hotels as long as they are CLEAN...Front desk was excellent and accommodating!,Jan 31| 2019,3,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108
Surprisingly thin walls (floor) for such an upscale hotel. Even moderately elevated voices/noises were distractingly loud or disruptive (eg| to sleeping). Otherwise| just what was advertised and what I'd expect from Hilton.,Feb 4| 2019,4,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

We enjoyed our stay. Beds were comfortable. Staff were friendly. Although I wasn't happy on a bottle of wine I had bought there. There was a certain of wine I was wanting and the bar didn't carry it. So staff suggested another. Saying it was similar. So we brought it to our room to enjoy. It was the most awful tasting wine ever! It wasn't even close to the one we had wanted. So that was a disappointment. The bottle went to waste and our money. Staffs needs to know their wine better!!,Feb 4| 2019,4,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108
Very good location. Very nice hotel people. So glad to stay in this hotel for my trip to San Francisco. Will choose again next time.,Feb 3| 2019,5,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

We booked a bay view and got a city view. They were sold out so they couldn't change our room. They gave us vouchers for breakfast (it says a full breakfast) but it was really the buffet which cost about $29 a person. I wanted to order something off the menu instead| which actually cost less and was not allowed to do so. They also gave us $50 at the bar so that was nice but again there should have been more flexibility when it comes to using the comps at hotel facilities. And again| we were disappointed in our room since we really had wanted a bay view since it was my friend's first time staying in SF. Rooms seem a bit out dated too. The "queen" bed really seemed liked a full.,Jan 8| 2019,3,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

In fact one of the staff remembered me from the day before| though I did not remember him. They were great. I wish I could have enjoyed the hotel more. The garage was okey| had to really maneuver around though. Glad my Girl Friend did the driving here| and of course San Francisco streets can be somewhat difficult.

Room was a good size| clean| well presented and comfortable.Disappointed with the level of service from the staff. As we had a lot a of luggage between us| we needed some help bringing it in. We had to ask staff twice for some assistance but gave up as we were left waiting for so long.Also all 3 mornings during our stay we heard drilling and banging from the floor above us. When we asked staff at the reception whether they had planned maintenance| no-one seemed to know! As the noise was right above us| we were given the option to move rooms but we only wanted to if it was to continue for more than one day. We were told staff would investigate and let us know. They did not.

It is nearby almost all attraction| so it's a good location. Parking will be costlier since you will have to pay 60$ per day if you have your own car.,Dec 25| 2018,4,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108
It was a nice place to stay. The only thing I could think of were that the walls were paper thin so you could hear everything around you and others could hear you too. They were very quick when we asked for more pillows and blankets and the room was very clean and in a good location.,Dec 23| 2018,4,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108
Quite a few turnoffs... valet/overnight parking didn't work at 10:05pm and had to self park then exit the next morning. Breakfast was bad| from un-toasted bread on an Eggs Benedict to unripe fruit served. Complained to the front desk clerk who said she'd credit both items| then ended up charging $150. And they even charge business travelers a petty charge for wifi! Really petty.,Dec 23| 2018,1,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

Ridiculously loud in the room all night. Paper thin walls means listening to neighbors’ TV / whatever else they’re doing all night. Service people unloading supplies to storage and chatting right next to the room at 2am every night of stay all week. Pretty awful sleeping situation.  I’ve stayed before and sometimes you get a room that’s ok| but there’s zero control on what you get for what you pay for and huge spectrum of possibilities apparently. Probably won’t roll their dice again after getting a room this bad on a business trip.

Hotel was good and centrally located but my room had some issues. My room had no curtains or blinds :(,Sep 9| 2018,3,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108
Although I expected the Hotel to be closer to the Financial District and I would more accurately call this location Chinatown| it was newly renovated and the entire neighborhood was re-energized. The staff were super helpful and not at all invasive - perfect balance of helpful and friendly but well enough designed that help was not needed that often.,Sep 9| 2018,5,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108
as an Hilton in downtown SanFrancisco| was dirty (hair in the bed)| “upgrading” me to the worse room available!!!| as 2 single bed (120cm...even Hilton SFO list it as 2  king size bed/full bed!!!)| any morning call! Some hostel are much better| fun & enjoyable clean | with nice decoration! From the windows| impossible to sea outside (Hilton keep clean only some sharing area| like windows on the corridor| or some part of the lobby)! Noisy all night| by neighbours on the side| corridor or walking loodly like elephants/wood construction)! It looks more a ancient/old 2 stars hotel than a high standard business hotel to get rest from a li g flight (Hong-Kong via Europe +20h)! I was wrong to choice this Hilton| when Hyatt Hotel in SFO Airport was much much better (not new| but keeping well its standard)! Hilton SFO doesnt care about its clients| 50% chinese due the Chinatown| usually one of the community whom did not complains about dirty issues! A lasy Hilton hotel!,Sep 9| 2018,1,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

The front desk service is very bad because they are not willing to help.  In my case they gave me the worst rooms.  Has rooms / levels under renovation and they don't look great.  Sometimes you hear a lot of noise between rooms.  It has a good location and you can walk to interesting points in the city.  They do not have restaurant service| or luggage storage due to the covid If you stay several nights you can change rooms since they do not perform daily cleaning.,Nov 2| 2020,3,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

It was very uncomfortable and noisy| the walls were so thin that I heard the people next to my room snoring| people talking in the hallway| talking on the upper floor| every single noise. In the morning there was a layer of white fluff on top of everything| I guess it was coming from the AC. As a Hilton Owner I will never go back to that Hilton hotel anymore| they don’t care about quality no more.,Oct 5| 2020,2,Hilton San Francisco Financial District,750 Kearny St| San Francisco| CA| 94108

Das Hilton ist „in die Jahre“ gekommen. Wir nächtigten vor einigen Jahren schon mal hier. Exakt die Dienstleistungen und der Service wegen dem wir uns nochmals für eine Buchung im HIlton entschieden haben| war nicht mehr da. Das tolle Restaurant im ersten Stock wie auch die Bar in der Lobby fehlte. Statt dessen eine kleine Bar bei der Lobby die mehrheitlich geschlossen war und das Restaurant im hinteren Teil der Lobby das nicht gerade den „Wow-Effekt“ bescherte. Schade!  Die Zimmer sind solala. Zumindest waren diese sauber. Zum Personal und Service fehlen einem ein wenig die Worte. Den Kundenwunsch in den Fokus der Bemühungen zu stellen| scheint hier noch nicht angekommen zu sein. Eine Chinesin an der Bar| die die Augen verdreht| wenn sie einen Mojito mixen soll| der wie sie konsterniert festhält nicht auf der Karte ist!!Wer mit einem Mietwagen durch die Staaten düst| wird ab den Parkplatzgebühren des Hilton schon etwas erstaunt sein.

The room was so neat and clean| and I liked the part of where I can have bar table set right in front of the big window and had a cup of wine looking this beautiful scenery outside with a little ocean view with my girlfriend was absolutely amazing. Bathroom is awesome too| it just looks beautiful and clean. There is some decent blinder for the window with the control button and it perfectly covers sunlight when it is too bright| and it will help you with your comfortable staying and cozyness.
