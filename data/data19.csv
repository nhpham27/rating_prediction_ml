Location is amazing| only a few blocks from the Path Newport Station. We stayed for 3 nights and the room was clean upon arrival. Our room had a mini fridge and microwave which was convenient. Parking is available on site| we used self-parking which cost about $27 a night. In and out privileges which is a great option to have as well. Only downside was that the parking structure was a bit hard to figure out and because it was not attached to the Hotel| it was quite a struggle getting all our luggage up to our hotel room. Overall| our stay was pleasant and we felt very comfortable there.,Aug 16| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310
Close to all attractions and NYC,Aug 16| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310
The area was convenient to area attractions. Was disappointed that WiFi was additional fee.,Aug 14| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310
We were in town for a wedding a few miles away and this hotel was recommended to us by the wedding party. A recent renovation on the hotel was tastefully done.. and fabulous views from the room made it special and a delightful stay. With many restrictions at this time we felt very comfortable with our suite. It was modern very clean- with nice amenities in the bathroom. Two large screen TVs- one in the living area and one in the bedroom.At this time the hotel wasn’t serving breakfast inside the building but there’s a truck outside for coffee etc. delicious. There’s also a coffee maker in the room. Soft towels and lovely bedding made the stay delightful. We will be back again. I highly recommend this hotelin Jersey City. It is near everything. There is a nice park to walk around| nearby. Many rooms have city views and that’s special in itself. Look no further this is the place to go to. Hilton Hotels always make us feel welcomed.,Aug 11| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310
It was nice room with the view. Layout is great| furnishings are new and modern. Room was very cleaned and we had maintenance daily. Bathroom though needs some update. Wats in the sink and the tub didn’t drain very fast and you have to constantly pump it out. And there is no exhaust fan in the bathroom. Mirror gets steamy.,Aug 9| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310
We were in town for a funeral| and the accommodations were very disappointing and disgusting! The room couldn't have been sanitized according to the cdc guidelines. There was hair| dust and dirt everywhere! And there wasn't any tissue in one of our suites. They also didn't serve breakfast! It was muffins and coffee with powdered creamer| no milk  or half & half,Aug 5| 2021,1,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310
Overall|  the hotel stay was very good. I did ask for a cozier chair for my room. They only provided basic chairs. But unfortunately|  they were not able to oblige.Hotel is in great location near Path train station.,Aug 5| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310

Good hotel,Jul 29| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310
Awesome hotel! Staff was super nice. Junior suite was perfect set up for my family. Short walk to PATH if your looking to visit New York City. Parking is on site but it is 32 a day and coming from Virginia where most hotels have free parking that was a little steep but we knew we were in NJ and that was to be expected just noting so everyone is aware lol. Also there is a 100 dollar PER NIGHT incidental| I only state this because multiple reviews state it’s only 100 in general. Room itself was very clean and comfortable| had a great view of the city. Overall would stay here again when returning North!,Jul 28| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310

We stayed 2 nights in this hotel| with two kids in a room with a separate bedroom. It was cleaned well| but because of Covid-19 I went over with sanitation myself and found many places where previous guest left their mark. Coffee (even on headboard over bed) | makeup on French doors and a lot of dust. But after a quick swipe| I have no complaints.Internet cost 14 dollars| which we didn't use. Parking was next door| 32 dollars a night. It is what it is. We found the garage perfectly okay. And even saw our car from one of the windows in our room.Waking up to the view of Manhattan or seing the sunset shine on the windows across the lake was our kids favorite thing. Would stay there again.,Jun 26| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310

This place was everything we needed.   Clean and updated and close to NYC.   We didn’t park at hotel due to reviews saying it being dark and cramped.  We chose to park at the south garage which is next to the Westin.   The Westin is next door to doubletree.  It was $29 for 24 hours.  For parking it at 10pm thirsday and picking it up around 5pm Saturday it was $59 bucks.  The garage was well lit and I felt it was safe for parking overnight.  We used the Newport Path train to get into city.  The train is about a 4 min walk fromHotel   It’s $2.75 (one trip path ticket) to get into city and then you switch to the NYC metro system. We only stayed for 2 nights but didn’t want the headache of adding money to metro cards all the time.  We got the unlimited 7 day pass for $33 and it was worth it as we used the metro to go everywhere.   Def got our moneys worth for just two days in the city.   So between the clean hotel with nice beds and good views and close easy travel to and from city  I would stay here again.    A great visit overall!,Jun 20| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310

For what I expect of DoubleTree| it was underwhelming. The decor was very depressing: cold and serviceable| not a touch of charm or warmth. And please| how difficult is it to provide coffee cups and liquid creamer? Paper cups and powder are ok for Motel 6 but Hilton should be better. My sink was clogged| the refrigerator froze our food| and i had to try 3 floors to find a working ice machine.The staff were friendly and very accommodating so i do not hold them responsible for these management level decisions.

The property seemed very old. I stayed in room 1007 and the corridor outside room had bizarre zebra skin flooring which made the entrance to the room look ugly. There was no automatic light on/off system| you had to find light switches manually. Trash bins were small. Bathroom fittings were below par for a Hilton hotel standard. Room was not sound proof| you could hear noise from other rooms pretty easily. You need to be hilton honor member to access wifi but nowhere in the room was it written| had to call room service and then find out.Only good thing I found was the staffs| they were pretty prompt when called.I wouldn’t recommend this property if you are looking for high class stay. I spent 360 usd for two nights stay and it was not worth at all in my opinion?

Arrives at hotel and check in was smooth! Traveling with 3 kids and upon arriving in room pulled out the sofa bed which was filthy. Mark’s all over the sheets so called for new sheets and blankets! Went to take a shower there was hair all over the shower walls. Left hotel to go get food down the street opened the door to find the room next door having a party. Random people getting off elevator on our floor to attend this party! Went to get in elevator to go to lobby and the weed smell was unbearable. Capped off this awful trip by going outside this morning for some fresh air. Cars parked in front of valet with people sleeping in them and urine stains all over the snow banks in front of hotel. Would never stay or recommend to anyone.

I like the hotel. The room was spacious. You had to park your car next door and walk back across the driveway. When checking in I was never told there was a parking fee and they never told me how to get back down from the garage. Thank god there was a couple that pulled up and showed me. While checking out I didn’t know I had to pay for parking. I double checked on your site they were trying to charge me a couple dollars more. Then tried to tell me all of Jersey’s hotel charges for parking. I had to correct her on that part.,Jan 30| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310

Horrible experience at this hotel and did not feel clean or safe.,Feb 14| 2021,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310

I like the hotel. The room was spacious. You had to park your car next door and walk back across the driveway. When checking in I was never told there was a parking fee and they never told me how to get back down from the garage. Thank god there was a couple that pulled up and showed me. While checking out I didn’t know I had to pay for parking. I double checked on your site they were trying to charge me a couple dollars more. Then tried to tell me all of Jersey’s hotel charges for parking. I had to correct her on that part.,Jan 30| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310
It was good but i got assigned with a room i didnt book and i couldnt change it because they didnt have another one and some of the lights didnt work plus the bathroom sink kept stopping up,Dec 19| 2020,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310
Great stay awesome area so close to the mall and other attractions. Great staff from the front desk workers to the housekeeping it was all phenomenal definitely a relaxing smooth stay during a very well needed time. Only downfall is due to COVID restrictions the amenities and food court was shut down.

The hotel room I was allocated was right near the Elevator and the room was not sound proofed properly as I hear the dinging of the Elevator all night.  I asked to be moved and they said they were unable to move me.

Room was large| half decent view of the river and NYC| didnt get to have a drink at the bar because we were too tired from a long day so I enjoyed the comfortable bed. Parking onsite with in/out was nice for $25.,Sep 29| 2018,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310

The hotel is close to the PATH station so access to NYC is very convenient. We also got to try the light rail train with the closest station just behind the hotel. We had our fill of DoubleTree’s famous chocolate chip cookies! One thing that could have made our stay more comfortable is if the hotel provided free drinking water inside the room or at least a water fountain on every floor. We stayed in a suite with 2 queen sized bed. The room is big and the beds are comfortable. We indicated in our reservation that there are 4 people staying in the room. Upon check in| they only provided 2 sets of towels. Amenities lacked toothbrushes| toothpaste and shower caps.,Sep 21| 2018,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310

A block from the river and the river walk with great views across to the skyline of New York| particularly at sunset. This hotel is a good alternative to staying in Manhattan - cleaner| quieter and generally a nicer location with easy access to Manhattan by public transport.,Oct 2| 2018,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310
Loved this hotel | very clean| modern| confortable beds| awesome view. We had a double bed suite in the 7th floor with ny city views spectacular. Front desk was most  helpful and cordial| only downside was the parking $ 25 daily but overall gantastic stay,Oct 2| 2018,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310
The hotel room I was allocated was right near the Elevator and the room was not sound proofed properly as I hear the dinging of the Elevator all night.  I asked to be moved and they said they were unable to move me. If you do book this hotel make sure you are allocated a room far away from the elevator so you will have a peaceful rest.,Oct 1| 2018,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310

We had a wonderful time staying at the DoubleTree. The location was perfect and in close proximity to places to eat| the waterfront and access to NYC and Hoboken. The hotel was clean and comfortable even though there was construction right out our window. The light rail also went by our window| but was silent as it went by. The staff was superb and very helpful. We were greeted by Juanita at the front desk when we checked in and she worked hard to get us checked into a room earlier than the time posted so we could start exploring. Juanita also was very helpful during our trip giving us tips of places to go and eat.

The room was very clean and new| with all commodities. However| for the price we paid| there were a few small things that were quite annoying (we were 4 but there were only 2 towels| the bar in the shower was loose| ...). Also| I hate hotels that don't provide free WiFi. Housekeeping was super nice and friendly though (thanks Maria!).,Apr 2| 2018,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310

Just had a baby and wanted to get away for 1 night with the family. Upon entering the restroom i noticed a bedbug on the floor. I am completely traumatized as my 4 month old was sleeping in a playpen near the floor.

It seems odd that you would call room service only to be directed to Google search another restaraunt and have them deliver.. like isnt that point of room service? Plus they charge for wifi(even though it says it's free on hotels .com) plus I got the king suite corner with the city view only  to be directed to the 6th floor -__- .. some view. Oh yeah paid for a smoking room only to find out the entire premises is smoke free.. false advertising at its finest| but yeah..

They apologized and changed the sheets for when I got back. The beds were very comfortable I fell right to sleep. The room is beautiful and would definitely stay there again.

I arrived at this hotel after a long journey and really needed water. Asked the staff member checking me in if they had any complimentary water but she said no and I could buy some from the shop. She was very unhelpful and robotic. To add insult to injury she offered me a complimentary cookie which I didn't need.The room was actually very very nice with a separate lounge area and was very impressed with it. On the morning of checking out I got served by the same woman Monica and asked if I could use the complimentary wifi in the lobby. She informed me it wasn't complimentary which I knew wasn't true as had seen it on the webpage. In the end she gave me the key "as I was leaving anyway".A different lady checked me out and asked how my stay was. Explained the room was lovely but the other lady was very unhelpful with a poor attitude. Explained what happened and she said they did have complimentary water on arriving and complimentary wifi in the lobby. She apologised profusely for the other lady but said it was too late as I was checking out to stay at another hotel about 30metres up the road.Overall was a poor stay ruined by one staff member.,Oct 23| 2017,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310

The hotel was a typical DoubleTree by Hilton which was nice and comfortable enough. Just annoyed that for the cost of the night (near $400.00) there was no free wifi in the room ( How hard is that? ) and when i wanted a simple cup of coffee I was directed to the restaurant. I travel a lot for business and having a complimentary carafe of coffee available in the lobby goes a long way. Wifi and coffee are pretty essential when I travel. Hilton certainly can splurge for both but choose not to. Small things like this annoy me enough to look to another brand in the future.,May 2| 2017,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310
It is a nice hotel| it was clean and service was good| except for the bellhop. We worked around him. Everything else was clean| and enjoyable.  The hotel shares a driveway with a condo high rise. This leads to some blockages as people double park in front of the Condo and sometimes block the access to the Hotel front door.  The self-parking garage is a little confusing and feels very tight as you try to drive thru it| but it is close to the hotel and easy enough to use. A lot of one way streets in the area| pay close attention to the traffic and signs.,May 2| 2017,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310

The hotel was a typical DoubleTree by Hilton which was nice and comfortable enough. Just annoyed that for the cost of the night (near $400.00) there was no free wifi in the room ( How hard is that? ) and when i wanted a simple cup of coffee I was directed to the restaurant. I travel a lot for business and having a complimentary carafe of coffee available in the lobby goes a long way. Wifi and coffee are pretty essential when I travel. Hilton certainly can splurge for both but choose not to. Small things like this annoy me enough to look to another brand in the future.,May 2| 2017,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310
It is a nice hotel| it was clean and service was good| except for the bellhop. We worked around him. Everything else was clean| and enjoyable.  The hotel shares a driveway with a condo high rise. This leads to some blockages as people double park in front of the Condo and sometimes block the access to the Hotel front door.  The self-parking garage is a little confusing and feels very tight as you try to drive thru it| but it is close to the hotel and easy enough to use. A lot of one way streets in the area| pay close attention to the traffic and signs.,May 2| 2017,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310

The stay was great| the staff superb.  What I didn't like was our Hotels.com experience.  First| I did NOT get Hilton points and this was not obvious in the material I read before booking.

The was a very cosmopolitan area - upmarket with waterfront with great views of Manhattan. Easy access to NYC via Pathway underground ($2.75 each way) to 9/11 site via the new Westfield centre (amazing place - MUST SEE). Trains run 24/7. The Newport Mall in 5 mins walk from hotel or use free shuttle service. Great place to eat on the third floor. Our car hire place was nearby (Budget) and took the free shuttle bus. The supermarket is in the same place and great value for money to stock up the soda at $1 rather than $2. Oh yes - the hotel give their famous cookies !!!!! Kids usually get more if asked for.

Overall| the experience was pleasant.  There were minor irritations that if addressed| would have made the stay better.  The hotel was hot in the hallways.  While waiting for the elevator| we began sweating before we got to the car.  This was after we showered and prepared to spend the evening with family.  We had to request towels b/c there was only enough for 2 when we had 3 in the room.  A remote control was missing to the TV but this was addressed right away.  Also| for as much as the rooms are...why is water $5?  Complimentary items go a long way.  Guests would appreciate free water especially after we've forked over quite a bit to stay at the hotel.The room was very clean and well lit.  The bed was super comfortable and spacious.  The pull out bed was used by our child| so it was accommodating.  The shower/tub area was spacious although the vanity could be a bit bigger.  We are a family of 3 and had bottles for this and that and it wasn't enough room.,May 31| 2016,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310
The room was decent with good view however one would never think that in 350 USD per night charge| breakfast will not be included. You just have to be very careful going through the details. Some of the front desk staff was very negligent and behaved as if they were doing a favor to you. We kept waiting for the shuttle but the lady did not bother to tell the driver. The hotel must ensure that all the staff is trained to treat all the guests equally.,May 28| 2016,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310

Room and hotel location was great. The hotel gave a welcome cookie which was delicious but it was 310 calories. The parking was too expensive. The hotel should not charge for WIFI separately. It make hotel look cheap.,Jul 6| 2016,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310

It was a comfortable stay.,Jun 7| 2016,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310
Overall| the experience was pleasant.  There were minor irritations that if addressed| would have made the stay better.  The hotel was hot in the hallways.  While waiting for the elevator| we began sweating before we got to the car.  This was after we showered and prepared to spend the evening with family.  We had to request towels b/c there was only enough for 2 when we had 3 in the room.  A remote control was missing to the TV but this was addressed right away.  Also| for as much as the rooms are...why is water $5?  Complimentary items go a long way.  Guests would appreciate free water especially after we've forked over quite a bit to stay at the hotel.The room was very clean and well lit.  The bed was super comfortable and spacious.  The pull out bed was used by our child| so it was accommodating.  The shower/tub area was spacious although the vanity could be a bit bigger.  We are a family of 3 and had bottles for this and that and it wasn't enough room.,May 31| 2016,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310
The room was decent with good view however one would never think that in 350 USD per night charge| breakfast will not be included. You just have to be very careful going through the details. Some of the front desk staff was very negligent and behaved as if they were doing a favor to you. We kept waiting for the shuttle but the lady did not bother to tell the driver. The hotel must ensure that all the staff is trained to treat all the guests equally.,May 28| 2016,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310
Nice hotel close to shopping and path station.  Room was very nice and comfortable.  The staff were super.  They were extremely friendly and made sure everything was perfect.,Apr 17| 2016,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310
Double tree hotel is totally money minded hotel where they are thinking complementary items are their wish... They aren't even giving the water as free. When I first checked in I asked any other rooms in top floor.. Receiptionist told me no rooms available and then once I reached room I realized the room is for two people and we are three| so again contacted them they said hardly they get another room for us in 2 minutes of time... And I am not sure how the receiptionist told me there is no room available for exchange few minutes back. Once I i formed their mistake about room they said their will exchange the room...as we paid 450$ for three days every customer will expect basic things like water and coffee as free||| they behave like the complementary items are their wish... Hampton inn and La Quita in hotels are very friendly and they would completely care about your stay... But double tree hotel won't care... Waste of money for this Hotel... Only good thing about this hotel is location...no any other things are good about this hotel..|,Apr 10| 2016,1,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310
I was in Jersey City for business. I had a cargo van picking up network equipment. I couldn't park the van in the provided parking by DT. The van was to tall to drive into the parking garage.

My wife and I stayed here for two nights; we mainly visited New York| taking the PATH train into the city in the morning and back later in the day. The DoubleTree was certainly convenient for that purpose| being quite close to the station.However| the beds were quite uncomfortable. There wasn't a quilt| and the pillows were some of the most uncomfortable I have ever encountered in a hotel.,Mar 25| 2016,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310

This hotel was nice| but lacking in many areas. For instance in the year of 2016 they are still charging for wifi at what I would consider a place that marks itself as a premium hotel. The bedding was significantly lacking and the pillows were a true let down. That bathroom was probably the nicest part of the room which was nice. The builders of the room put light switches in annoying an seemingly strange places.

Views over Manhattan fantastic. So close to the Path station to commute to Manhattan. Newport Mall also handy and a ShopRite just behind the hotel. Rooms spacious and very well appointed. We arrived at 2am in the morning and staff were helpful and aware of our late arrival. Courtesy shuttle to Hertz rentals also much appreciated. It was just great to come back to our hotel at Double Tree after a tiring day sight seeing on Manhattan Island. Restaurants close by plus food court at Newport Mall and good meals to go from the Shoprite supermarket.Would highly recommend this hotel.,Sep 28| 2015,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310

Views over Manhattan fantastic. So close to the Path station to commute to Manhattan. Newport Mall also handy and a ShopRite just behind the hotel. Rooms spacious and very well appointed. We arrived at 2am in the morning and staff were helpful and aware of our late arrival. Courtesy shuttle to Hertz rentals also much appreciated. It was just great to come back to our hotel at Double Tree after a tiring day sight seeing on Manhattan Island. Restaurants close by plus food court at Newport Mall and good meals to go from the Shoprite supermarket.Would highly recommend this hotel.,Sep 28| 2015,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310

The front desk lady seems to be ALWAYS busy.. Called a few times for small question| every time was asked to hold for more than 10 mins without answering back.

Nice Hotel| but staff was not helpful.  When I booked| I indicated that we would be flying in for a wedding and would like to get into our room a little early as we would have just gotten off a long flight and would have to be at a wedding for 6:00.  I received no response to this request. On the form for booking| don't put a spot for comments if no one is going to look at the comments and respond. When we arrived at noon| our room was not ready.  The confirmation that I had indicated that check in would be at 3:00| but was hoping to not to have to wait until 3:00.  The hotel staff said they would call me when it was ready.  At 3:00 I still had not received at call.  We headed back to the hotel| and they told me that they happened to have a room ready even though check in was not really until 4:00 (this was not the same information that was on my confirmation).  I understand that check in is not officially until later| but an attempt to accommodate would have been good.  Typically you have to be out of a room by 10:00| so there must have been some room available or close to ready.  We had to leave early the next morning| so we had the room for much less than 24 hours.

The hotel and room were very nice and clean. Spacious enough for our family of 5. It did have double beds instead of queen - which was fine for us but some others may prefer queen size. There was a living room with a pull out couch which was perfect for us. The two complaints I would have would be that the elevators were a bit slow...there were only two that were for guest use and it took forever to get downstairs. Also there was an elevator in the parking garage that didn't work so we ended up taking the stairs with all our luggage when we got there. There was another operational elevator in the garage but we didn't know that when we arrived. Also| I got some conflicting instructions on how to access the subway/PATH when we wanted to leave. It took us a bit to find it. I think it would be helpful if they had maps/instructions printed out and hand them to guests when they arrive. We are not used to using this kind of transportation so that would have been a little blessing.,Jul 13| 2015,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310

(2|75$ pr. person)Desværre er det lidt omstændigt med fly til JFK - enten 150$ i taxi| eller en længere togrejse med 2 skift og en gåtur på et par blokke. Super beliggenhed med fly til/fra Newark.,Nov 20| 2015,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310
Stort rum med separat sittavdelning| perfekt för en familj med barn. Rent och prydligt. Mycket bra service vid in och utcheckning| hjälpsam personal som ordnade förvaring av bagage och transport till flygplatsen. Toppenläge| nära till tåg till Manhattan.,Nov 3| 2015,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310
숙박은 편안했으나| 뉴욕으로의 이동/교통편은 불편| 주변에 관광/좋은 레스토랑 등의 위치는 안좋음,Nov 2| 2015,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City,455 Washington Boulevard| Jersey City| NJ| 07310
