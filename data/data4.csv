Good location w plenty of dining options within a short walk. Front desk was very responsive| room was a good size & in-room coffee maker was a homerun. Business office also came in handy.,Aug 16| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
Room pictures are nothing like advertised.  Also| beware of the city view option when selecting a room| we never did get one and when we asked for the room the answer was| "it is what it is".  Kudos Hilton!,Aug 3| 2021,2,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
Everything was fine just a broken light and we had an ADA room bc I’m wheelchair bound but there was no roll in shower. Everyone was nice and pleasant. Thanks!,Aug 2| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

Friendly staff/ Rooms were clean but just average. Requested city view but had view of what appeared to be a fashion warehouse building. The staff was great and moved us to a higher floor when rooms were available. However still had no city view. The move did get my family all on the same floor. The first two nights we were on 3 different floors.,Jul 14| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

Hilton is always nice and clean,Jun 12| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
The room that was initially given to me had a problem with the toilet. Since I just got in the room and hadn’t settled in yet| I thought I would just head back down to the front desk and request a new room. When I explained to Agnes what the issue was and that I wanted a new room| she stated that there was non need to get a new room| since she would be sending someone from maintenance to fix the toilet issue. I return to my room and waited nearly 10 minutes before I had to call down to see if the gentleman was coming| as I was on a tight time schedule to get ready for an engagement. When the gentleman inspected the toilet (he was very nice) he told me that this would not be a “5 minute job” as Agnes claimed it would be. The gentleman called the front desk to let Agnes know that I would in fact need a new room. So now I had to go BACK DOWNSTAIRS to get the new room and I HAD ORIGINALLY REQUESTED. I do not understand why I had to go back and forth and be further inconvenienced. When I went back down| Agnes would not even acknowledge what had just transpired. Another lady already has a new room available for me. It literally would have taken Agnes less than 5 minutes for her to provide me a new room. My time was wasted for no reason. Really annoying.,Jun 11| 2021,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
The hotel location is excellent. A lot of dining options and subway stations and bus stops are 3 -8 min away. Close to the center but very quiet. However| I do not understand we got an accessible room though I requested a regular room. If I would not mind an accessible room| there were more hotel options we wanted to stay. A reason I picked Hilton Garden Inn Park Ave is there WAS a regular room with 2 beds. I paid for it but did not get it. Also| their receptionist instructed me to request housekeeping when we needed it. We stayed there for 4 nights and I requested only 1 cleaning TWICE but we did not get it. I called and asked them for 3rd time and finally got our room cleaned. They must be shorthanded because of Covid| but it was annoying.,Jun 9| 2021,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

A nice hotel in a great location! Close to restaurants| subway| and it’s in walking distance of several landmarks. Although the room was small| (if you’re used to NYC hotel rooms| it wouldn’t phase you) it had everything we needed| and it was clean. I would definitely stay here again!,May 17| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
The hotel is conveniently located in Midtown. The room was clean| although a little "worn". Like most small NY hotels| the rooms are on the small side but not uncomfortably so| although it seemed unnecessarily cramped by an oversized desk chair which needs to be tucked under the desk in order to get passed to shut the curtains| etc. The bathroom is small| but clean and adequate with enough counter space for a few items. The closet is on the small side as well| something to consider if you have a lot of hanging clothes or heavy coats| but it was sufficient for our needs.As far as outside noise coming in| the room was very quiet but as others have mentioned| the in-room air conditioner was rather loud which woke us up several times a night. The small refrigerator in the room made a very uncomfortable| high pitched noise as well. We asked them to replace it| and if they did (we were out that day) the second one did the same thing so we just turned it off as we weren't using it anyway. We had a room with 2 queen beds| one of which was more comfortable than the other which  probably wouldn't have been a big deal for a few nights| but we were there for 8| so between that and the somewhat noisy AC and the refrigerator| it wore on us a bit by the end of our stay. Everything was still closed due to Covid| so there's no on-site dining of any sort although they do have a nice small store with items for sale to go. Just FYI| the photos we saw of the hotel showed a roof-top restaura,May 11| 2021,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

I liked that you need your room key to access building and elevator.  Search for parking before hand.,May 3| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
It was in the perfect location for our purpose in the city. The room was very clean| great city view and covid guidelines carried out throughout the hotel.,Apr 28| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
Close to 34 St.| public transportation| dining| and major tourist spots.  This hotel follows COVID-19 protocol| and has polite customer service.  I even got a city view with my room| which was beautiful to look at night.  Only thing that sucked was that their restaurant was closed| but hey| New York is a food hub all over.,Apr 26| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

It was stated that it was a family friendly| however the weed smoke came through the vents.  Then the lobby has a bathroom that is shared by a club on the main floor and that had intoxicated females being take. In an ambulance.

The hotel was nice.  Rooms were basic but functional.  There was some food remnants and trash under the bed from the previous guests| and the coffee machine was broken| but I wasn't bothered by that.  In a perfect world they wouldn't charge $75 for a late check-out when the hotel was almost empty because of Covid; but I understand it is policy.  I woud stay again if I needed to be in the area and the price was right.,Dec 11| 2020,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

It was a great stay!!! The room was extremely comfortable and room service/customer service were wonderful!! Would definitely come again!!,Dec 15| 2020,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
The hotel was nice.  Rooms were basic but functional.  There was some food remnants and trash under the bed from the previous guests| and the coffee machine was broken| but I wasn't bothered by that.  In a perfect world they wouldn't charge $75 for a late check-out when the hotel was almost empty because of Covid; but I understand it is policy.  I woud stay again if I needed to be in the area and the price was right.,Dec 11| 2020,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

It was great| very clean and comfy. The staff and view was great and walking distance to all the tourist sites. I’m just sad the cleaning people mistakenly threw away my dirty clothes when they were cleaning the room since it was in a plastic bag.,Oct 3| 2020,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

Our bathroom door fell off the tracks and fell onto the bed as I was working. Thankfully able to move my computer and didnt hit me. Moved rooms| the new room smelled like cigars. Moved again| this room was fine. Main problem was not everyone was wearing masks| guests checking in had no masks| guests waiting for the elevators| no masks....guests trying to pile onto the elevators. Staff was very pleasant and if it were not Covid| possibly I wouldn't be as bothered  but as the epicenter for the virus| hotels must demand all guests where masks at all times.,Aug 24| 2020,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

The Hilton Garden Inn is very convenient to NYU hospital and I stayed there during my wife's recent stay.  The hotel is clean and the staff very friendly. The room is not oversized so it can become crowded during the end of the stay when my wife was released.

The hotel was convenient| clean| comfortable| and the staff was generally helpful. However| I have one complaint I'm still trying to work out with the staff. At check-out| I requested the desk call a yellow cab for me. I had check prices and times on Uber| Yellow Cab| and other options and asked for Yellow Cab. Instead| the desk person called a limo/black car service| which took the long route and charged $20-25 more than Yellow Cab. I asked before getting in the car if the price was the same as Yellow Cab and that I did not request a car service. The driver said| "yes| it's the same|" but| of course| that was not the truth. I called the front desk to complain and she said they can't call Yellow Cab. I asked why they didn't say this up front. The conversation continues soon....Hopefully with some recompense for this deliberate miscommunication. Obviously| the wait for this particular driver| the long drive| and the connections between the hotel staff and the car company/driver are primary concerns rather than guest satisfaction.,Feb 18| 2020,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

I liked the efficient design of the room and bathroom| seemed to be recently updated| though room somewhat small. It was helpful to have the microwave and small refrigerator| but the coffeemaker definitely did not work after several tries. Room was very quiet and pleasant. Staff was excellent. Location allowed walking to many midtown attractions. I will probably stay there again.,Dec 29| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

Subway station literally on your doorstep so easy to get anywhere in the city quickly. Hotel clean and room surprisingly spacious for NYC. Didn’t use hotel facilities much as we were out a lot but tea| coffee and cookies were a nice touch each day. Coffee machine| fridge and microwave in room also handy. Usually prefer to stay further downtown but would stay here again for sure.,Dec 27| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

When we checked in| they said that the “city view” double room we booked didn’t exist. They said that none of their double rooms have views due to a tall building on that side of the hotel and that the website was wrong. OK| fine| nothing they can do about that but at least update the incorrect website so that people know what they’re booking. Housekeeping skipped us the second day so we requested new towels and wash cloths.  We had to call and ask twice before a staff member brought us a stack of literally wadded up towels.  The room was tiny. It looked clean but did not smell fresh.  The location is very convenient. Still| would never choose this hotel again.,Dec 23| 2019,2,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

Overall| we had a very pleasant stay here. The pros: the staff were all wonderful. They were very accommodating| and helpful without any sense of being put out. The coffee (in the morning) and tea & ice water (in the afternoon) is a nice add on for a lobby with very limited space. The rooms are nice enough - our TV was a good size (though never used) and it was nice to have a fridge and microwave| though we also never used them. We needed to switch rooms| and the request was accommodated by Agnes without the slightest sense that I was making anything harder for the staff. We brought down our bags the next morning| and by the next afternoon| we got keys to our room and the staff had already deposited our baggage. Housekeeping was impeccable. The cons: Our first night| we were in a room right next to the elevator| and basically everything was wrong with it. While it was larger than our subsequent room| the air conditioning didn't work (and windows obviously don't open on the 27th floor)| the wallpaper seemed haphazardly painted on| there was a tiny television with a very odd dresser setup| and while I'm fine with a small room| my side of the bed was nearly impossible to get in and out of. I guess I wouldn't know whether those rooms are representative of the whole hotel| but I'd advise not accepting a room ending in "00" - they seem to have different setups. The A/C situation wasn't great throughout the stay| and I just expect decent climate control for the amount paid.,Dec 2| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

Very clean if smallish rooms. We had booked two rooms as we were a family of two. One room had a spacious bathroom with an overhead shower and a mobile/ hand held shower.The other room had a very small bathroom with just the overhead shower. Both bathrooms were spotlessly clean though with more than enough towels and toiletries. I had forgotten my toothbrush and this was provided to me upon calling reception. Even though we had booked the rooms days ahead| we were not given rooms high up. We were given rooms on 3rd and 5th floors respectively as such not on the same floor even though I asked them to do this as we were a family and wanted to stay together. The hotel is about a kilometre from Penn station. I'd give the whole experience a 4 out of 5.,Nov 13| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

Booked for daughter to stay at after working at summer camp. Wanted somewhere safe and clean for one night before flying home to UK. She loved it especially shower. She felt safe and was in good area. Cab to JFK expensive though but worth it for her to be in a safe area.,Aug 27| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
Had to request a different room due to the smell inside. Moved rooms and safe didn’t work| hotel said they had fixed it but it didn’t work. On checkout no one asked how my stay was and couldn’t be bothered to pass the time of day. No questions about Hilton Honours membership of which I am but found the room cheaper vis Hotels.com At $200 a night you expect more.,Aug 27| 2019,2,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

The sidewalk and curb at the street right outside the hotel was filthy| if the city can't clean it then the hotel should.The hotel's Valet parking was not valet parking| you had to drive down the block to find it. Instead| I parked in the parking garage right next to the hotel| at a less expensive rate than the "valet" parking.We had 2 double beds that filled-up the room and left little space for anything else. At least the room and bathroom were clean. Breakfast was not included as is the case in every other HGI that I've stayed in.Not a good choice for families with young children or grandchildren.As a Hilton Honors member| I expected far better.,Aug 25| 2019,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

I expected a little better since is a Hilton hotel. The room was small but is ok because is located in Manhattan. The room didn’t have iron| iron board| safe| closet| I found this items in all other hotels in USA. The breakfast was too pricey for what they had there. Probably I would stay there again for the location| but next time I would be more prepared.,Aug 20| 2019,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

My stay was nice. I were originally requested to be at a high floor as I did not want to be near a city noise and I was accommodated with a 17th floor. Unfortunately the year was a leak in my bathroom so I had removed to the 5th floor which is right over a rooftop restaurant or bar. There was some noise but not overwhelming and they close pretty early so did not disturb rest after coming back from sightseeing. The rooms are comfortable but New York City small which is to be expected there was some paint chipping and wallpaper peeling over all the Room was clean. Considering the price and location I would stay again would devilie book a different type of Rome just for space. But overall great experience.,Aug 19| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

I was very impressed how nice and helpful the staff was. It is not easy to travel with small children and they really made our stay very pleasant. As for the food| I was disappointment in general| not just your hotel| to see that there were not healthy options to eat. There are people that eat organic| non GMO| gluten| dairy| nut| soy| artificial colors| preservatives free....all which are healthy. You would make such an impression if you started adding healthy options to your menu (organic gluten free oatmeal and/or cereal| organic/no artificial colors juices; even if you start with non GMO items and advertise this decision| I am sure you'll attract more customers/families). I did appreciate one of the staff helped me make some oatmeal I brought with me and also offered some delicious gluten free muffins. I wish they were at least non GMO. As for the rooms| great rooms| great beds| but...it would help if you freshened the carpets with a non toxic disinfectant (such as Seventh Generation).,Jul 22| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

My reservation was for a king bed and I was told that none was available and was given a small double.,Jun 10| 2019,1,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
The room was in a state I have never seen before when checking in. All doors open| stools and trash cans were on the bed and desk and refrigerator was wide open. The AC wouldn't go below 75 the entire time I was there.,Jun 9| 2019,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
Great| safe location| great staff. Room a little cosy but expected in NYC.,Jun 8| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

Great. Hotel was excellent. Staff very polite| food good. Lovely atmosphere,Jun 5| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
The location was very convenient and the price great| too.,Jun 4| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
Overall| we had a good stay. Room was smaller than we anticipated| but it was really just a place to sleep. Key cards kept giving us issues and there wasn't a lot of space in general to put anything. Microwave and refrigerator was a plus. You get what you pay for| there are comparable hotels in terms of price around the area that are much more spacious however.  We could have been more comfortable| but service was top tier.,Jun 4| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

Staff was friendly and efficient.  All very pleasant.  House keeping forgot an item each day| like a towel or a wash cloth or a bath mat or a few cups| but corrected it when a note was left.

The bathroom was nice sized with a fantastic shower. I wish the tv was bigger. It was the smallest tv i have seen in a hotel for the Hilton brand. Also  the safe didn't work in the room and it was a sound coming from the vent for the ac or the refrigerator not sure but it took some getting used to. Also the bed was squeaky so maybe a wood bed would be better. Overall me and my fiance really enjoyed our stay. The things that could change werent a big deal since we weren't in the room very much.  Thank you Hilton.,May 27| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

The air conditioner is loud and will wake you up every time it kicks on. There’s also a weird ticking sound that turns on as well.,Apr 29| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

Seemed like everything was new and beautiful. Staff constantly laughing| and seemed to love their jobs| but not all seemed too professional but they definately do their job and are very helpful. Rooms appeared super clean| but 1/2 inch of dust on bathroom vent| no fan in bathrooms| and the AC unit filter was solid brown dust and looked like it isn't being changed regularly. Toilet Roll holder was loose| paper falls off. Bed Lamps were loose| wallpaper peeling from bottom| all super minor| but collectively look bad. Our Windows was left open and unlocked. Didn't realize until I could hear every conversation at street level from the 5th floor. Checking closed windows| fixing loose fixtures| etc... seem the back of the house| cleaning and maintenance has got to do better. From a security perspective| their rfid cards to get to each floor is really secure since only 10 room keys can access your floor as opposed to hundreds of people. The reader in the elevator is not as good as the ones on the door. Occasionally| takes a couple of swipes.,Apr 23| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

I really think it is time to give up on Hilton and the brand loyalty they try to get through their honors program. I bought the room through Hotels.com| and like in the past| I asked for my HH# to be added to my reservation at check-in. Other Hiltons explained that of course| I couldn't get points for staying there| but I would receive perks| etc like early check-in| higher floors etc. The clerk at check-in told me that was not possible| and would not take my Hilton honors number. It was weird. Her argument was to downplay the perks so I wouldn't be missing anything (?) It should be known that this is a very basic hotel with  a very small lobby. It should have been a red flag that on hotels.com all the pictures presented were of the restaurant next door and their outside bar (must be on a higher floor). Cons: small room with difficulty laying out our two suitcases| tiny TV| weird layout| large bright red stain in the carpet. Bad lightingPros: Doing laundry was a breeze in their machines in the basement. Bed is comfortableI don't understand the fabulous rating. It is a basic hotel in a semi-central location. The only redeeming thing is that I only paid $115/night before taxes. For that it was a bargain. But with the thousands of hotels and hotel chains in NYC to get our business| I'm sad to say I don't have loyalty to Hilton anymore.,Dec 28| 2018,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

Went for a short getaway after getting married. The hotel location was nice. We told them it was our honeymoon and they gave us a room with a great view and a lovely bottle of champagne. Staff were friendly and hotel required key to use the elevator which was great. What was upsetting was on our second night we woke up at 3 am with a leak in our ceiling. The spot prior had a crappy plaster job done and was painted over with paint on the wallpaper so it was clear they knew about the issue before. We alerted the front desk and were quickly given a key to a new room. They gave a sort of half assed apology and left. No offering to help move our suitcases| nothing. We had to pack up and move everything out of our room to the next floor and didn’t get settled and back to sleep until about 430am. We were exhausted and had to cancel a get together we had planned for later that morning. I would have hoped they would have offered a partial refund for the night or at least a later check out but nothing.,Nov 25| 2018,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

The location was very good.  We were placed on the 6th floor| 4 floors above the open air bar the evening of the McGreggor fight.  The bar was very loud until around 12:30 AM or so.  Hilton needs to determine which must be sacrificed| the bar| or the rooms that face the bar.  I am an architect and have never seen anything quite like this.  We arrived at the hotel at 3:10| but our reservation for a two-bed room could not be accommodated without a 40 min delay as they readied a room.   The problem was our son was being married in Brooklyn (a 4:30 PM wedding)... a small affair| but that delay| and a major accident on the highway coming to NYC| made us 10 minutes late for the wedding.  We had called in advance to advise them of the critical nature of the timing| but it was lost on the staff. That being said| the desk attendant did all she could to try to make this bad experience right| gave us free breakfast| but ultimately we were late for the wedding and| upon return| were up until around 1:00 AM| or so| because of the noisy lounge.  Although she was great| a male manager (her superior) looked on totally indifferent to our plight| shrugged his shoulders and said they will need to wait for the room.  We needed the room in order for my wife and daughter to freshen-up before the wedding. Even though the accident-caused traffic delay was not their fault| had the room been ready when we arrived| we would have made the wedding with one-half hour to spare.,Oct 12| 2018,2,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
The hotel was fine and in a great location. However| the room was small and both the rug and the bed spread had stains on them which was disheartening. The air conditioner worked well| shower was great| bed and sheets were comfy| and the complimentary coffee in the lobby in the morning was delicious.  I wish there had been at least 2 complimentary water bottles in the room.,Oct 9| 2018,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
The a/c unit acted up a bit| and it was difficult to keep the room at a comfortable level.  Also| the elevators were noisy at night (our room was adjacent to the elevator bank),Oct 7| 2018,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

It was great experience.  Staff went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and then some!,Oct 13| 2018,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
The location was very good.  We were placed on the 6th floor| 4 floors above the open air bar the evening of the McGreggor fight.  The bar was very loud until around 12:30 AM or so.  Hilton needs to determine which must be sacrificed| the bar| or the rooms that face the bar.  I am an architect and have never seen anything quite like this.  We arrived at the hotel at 3:10| but our reservation for a two-bed room could not be accommodated without a 40 min delay as they readied a room.   The problem was our son was being married in Brooklyn (a 4:30 PM wedding)... a small affair| but that delay| and a major accident on the highway coming to NYC| made us 10 minutes late for the wedding.  We had called in advance to advise them of the critical nature of the timing| but it was lost on the staff. That being said| the desk attendant did all she could to try to make this bad experience right| gave us free breakfast| but ultimately we were late for the wedding and| upon return| were up until around 1:00 AM| or so| because of the noisy lounge.  Although she was great| a male manager (her superior) looked on totally indifferent to our plight| shrugged his shoulders and said they will need to wait for the room.  We needed the room in order for my wife and daughter to freshen-up before the wedding. Even though the accident-caused traffic delay was not their fault| had the room been ready when we arrived| we would have made the wedding with one-half hour to spare.,Oct 12| 2018,2,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
The hotel was fine and in a great location. However| the room was small and both the rug and the bed spread had stains on them which was disheartening. The air conditioner worked well| shower was great| bed and sheets were comfy| and the complimentary coffee in the lobby in the morning was delicious.  I wish there had been at least 2 complimentary water bottles in the room.,Oct 9| 2018,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
The a/c unit acted up a bit| and it was difficult to keep the room at a comfortable level.  Also| the elevators were noisy at night (our room was adjacent to the elevator bank),Oct 7| 2018,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
nice hotel. excellent location. just a few minutes walking from the empire state building. the only problem was the air conditioner made noise at night,Oct 2| 2018,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

The location of this property is fantastic! It is within walking distance of so many places| Penn Station| Time Square| Theater District| Grand Central| etc...We booked two rooms| and they were very clean. Our rooms were on the 5th floor and faced the side street. We were hoping for a higher floor| but they were all booked. Back in April we stayed at another hotel near Grand Central. That room was on the 12th floor| and we heard EVERYTHING all night! This time we were very leery about being even closer to the street level. Surprisingly| the rooms were very quiet. We almost forgot that we were in NYC!The staff was nice and helpful. We will definitely stay here again!,Sep 22| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

Kudos to the friendly and helpful staff and management at this Garden Inn.  My room was super clean| spacious| and had a lovely view of the city. The front desk and manager were very accommodating when I had to make a last minute change to my length of stay due to Hurricane Florence. I will definitely stay here again when I return and would highly recommend to anyone wanting a hotel with great staff| service| and a fantastic location.,Sep 20| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

It was my first time in Manhattan| NY. I liked how it had a restaurant/Bar attached to the hotel (Aintsworth) my Girlfriend has an allergy to feathers and when she told the front desk she needed an alternative option they switched it out promptly. Rooms were a little small but whatever. I would stay again. Close to the subway. Check in was fast and smooth.

The staff conducted themselves in a professional and courteous manner. The hotel lobby and room were also clean. My only complaint is that my room had a musty odor that I noticed when I checked in. I assumed the odor was caused by the air conditioning not being on (I visited in July) so I turned it on and left for a few hours. When I returned to the room the smell remained. I called the front desk and informed them that the room had a musty odor. Unfortunately there were no available rooms to move to| but the hotel staff offered to "spray" my room. I didn't want to have any treatments done to the room while I was preparing to turn in for the night so I declined. I'll be sure to complain immediately the next time something like this happens (hopefully it won't). I typically have a good experience when it comes to Hilton| I'm not sure what happened this time|  they usually have odor free rooms :(,Jul 28| 2018,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

Will definitely stay here again.,May 30| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
This was one of my best experiences at a hotel on the east coast. Miguel| the receptionist allowed us to check in early which my sister (who had flown 20 hours from Asia)| and I (redeye from the West Coast) were grateful for. The hotel is located in the Murray Hill neighborhood between Park and Madison Avenues and within walking distance from Grand central terminal| Flatiron| 5th Avenue| Shopping district. If you're not up to walking and want to take the metro instead| the metro is only a hop| skip and jump away from the hotel. The neighborhood also has excellent restaurants and is very safe. We were given a nice room on the upper floors. NYC hotels are notorious for being noisy but this room had brilliant insulation from noise. The internet was working at all times. The staff - both housekeeping and front desk very warm| friendly| hospitable and every ready to help. The rooms were bright| clean and cool. There were a couple of instances where all 3 elevators were being used by housekeeping staff so wait times were extended but barring that this was a great experience and contributed immensely to making this one memorable vacation. All in all I would not hesitate to return to the Hilton Garden Inn.,May 28| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

The stay was nice except that the original room was awful. The receptionist was very helpful and we moved to a room with a nice view If it was not for her it would have been bad. The restaurant for breakfast needs much improvement| we went to pain qutidine since it was much nicer| friendlier and much better service.,May 22| 2018,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
While non-descript on the outside| this hotel was classy on the inside. The water feature in the lobby maintained a nice clean smell. Coffee/tea/hot chocolate was available in the mornings and snacks/ice tea in the afternoon. My mom was injured during our stay (not in the hotel) and the staff was very accommodating. Good location| very close to the subway and a stones throw from the Empire State Building.

The room was / is clostraphobically small and had a putrid smell the entire time. Dirty disgusting carpet + Sick drain in shower and hand basin. The view was disgusting and looked out over a garbage dump. Worst outlook  I have ever experienced in NYC. From the arrival in the lobby| which probably has the original carpet| and was FILTHY| the hotel should be condemned.  However| the bathroom| apart from the disgusting smell| was quite nice and seemed to have NO connection or resemblance to the rest of the room or hotel.

Arrived at the hotel in the early morning and check-in time was at 3pm. Asked if we can check in early and the receptionist told us we can but for additional charge which we didn't mind. The room was on the second floor so it did not have any view of the city. The view was of the back of old apartment buildings. Need to have better cleanliness - found hair on the one of the towels. Overall| the hotel was okay but would prefer a higher floor.,Apr 1| 2018,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

The hotel is perfectly located in the mid town of the city. It is a 5min walk to the Empire State Building and a 20min walk to Times square.We drove in from Toronto and parked at Champion parking next door on the advice of the hotel staff as the hotel parking is a couple of blocks away. The hotel room was very clean and modern. We were three of us in a room and it was spacious enough for us. The beds were really comfortable and much needed after a long day of sightseeing. The room was equipped with a refrigerator| microwave| coffee machine and iron. We only used the coffee machine. There are a number of restaurants for all tastes just a quick walk away. I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a comfortable stay at a decent price.,Mar 6| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

Although MTA trains tend to suck. The hotel location is convenient for going into the city. Not too far from bars/restaurants. And for the price of the hotel and to be by park Ave definitely a deal.

(And there's a Gregorys coffee right across the road| which is a pro in my book!) King size bed filled the room| but still had all the amenities (refrigerator| nice shower| comfy bed| TV| desk| closet| dresser| etc.). Great locale and nice hotel.,Dec 21| 2017,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
The staff were very helpful. The rooms were small. Lower floors are noisy and there is also noise coming from the heating system. The location is OK| but nothing much around there. I didn't have much choice because I didn't book early enough. Not worth the almost $400 per night.,Dec 4| 2017,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

great hotel| clean| quiet (even though we were on 2nd floor)| quick lifts (rarely waited for more that a couple of mins)| perfect location to explore new york|  Great diners near by (Murray Hill Diner for breakfast).  Reception staff more that happy to provide advice and guidance.  Coffee machine| microwave and fridge in room which is really useful.  Mentioned it was our anniversary a few hours before we arrived and a lovely gift was there waiting for us.  Coffee / water / cookies in the lobby - all in all a top hotel stay!,Dec 25| 2017,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
Wonderful property to stay and relax. Staff was very courteous and helpful. Walking distance to many attractions in the town. Really had a four day fun stay.,Dec 23| 2017,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

Great location off Park Ave - walkable to midtown area / Grand Central / Empire State Building| and located right off the 6 train 33rd street station| which makes for a short ride to downtown. (And there's a Gregorys coffee right across the road| which is a pro in my book!) King size bed filled the room| but still had all the amenities (refrigerator| nice shower| comfy bed| TV| desk| closet| dresser| etc.). Great locale and nice hotel.,Dec 21| 2017,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
The staff were very helpful. The rooms were small. Lower floors are noisy and there is also noise coming from the heating system. The location is OK| but nothing much around there. I didn't have much choice because I didn't book early enough. Not worth the almost $400 per night.,Dec 4| 2017,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
The only downfall of this hotel is the noise coming from the night club that is attached. We were on the fifth floor and could still hear it. Hotel staff was incredibly friendly and helpful! Nice coffee shop conveniently located across the street and steps away from the subway and Empire State Building.,Nov 18| 2017,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
Bed was old and mattress had two person shaped dents in it| making it somewhat uncomfortable to sleep.  Otherwise| some basic wear and tear on the room but more or less consistent with expectations at this price point and location.,Nov 16| 2017,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

Room was nice| but there is a subway underneath so you can hear a train going by constantly. Try to request a room high up,Nov 14| 2017,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
Great hotel| rooms are on the smaller side but cozy enough. Great staff and the location is perfect! Walking distance to everything....very helpful staff.,Nov 14| 2017,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
Everything was fine except issues with air conditioning/heating. The good thing that we were moved to another room shortly after this issue arose.,Nov 14| 2017,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
The best shower ever in any hotel. Very efficient room lay out. Excellent front desk service. Very friendly manager Jon. Great amenities Free coffee tea cookies all day in the lobby. Will nake it my placevto stay in NYC from now onfir sure,Nov 7| 2017,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
really enjoyed our stay here - we had a twin room (2 double beds) which was a bit of a tight squeeze| but we didn't mind as we weren't spending a lot of time in the room. The beds were comfortable with quality bedding| and serviced to a high standard each day. walking distance to lots of major sights and right by a subway station. I'd definitely stay here again - great value.,Nov 7| 2017,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

立地は地下鉄の前で、空港バスも泊まるグランドセントラル駅からも近いので便利でした。とはいえ重いスーツケースですと徒歩でいくのはちょっと辛いかもしれません。ヒーターの音がとても大きいので、夜つけながらはきになるかもしれませんが、真冬はつけても寒いくらいなので迷いどころでした。あたたかい恰好を用意することをおすすめします。朝ごはんはあまり充実していません。脂っこいですね…,Feb 17| 2020,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

엠파이어스테이츠 빌딩과 코리안타운은 물론 타임스퀘어까지 도보로 이용가능하고 지하철과도 굉장히 가까워서 위치는 정말 훌륭하였습니다. 룸은 다소 작았지만 뉴욕 호텔중에선 신축답게 깨끗했으며 조식은 힐튼가든인 기본 조식수준 (딱 먹을만한 것들만 간단하게 있는 스타일) 이었으나 과일도 나름 나와서 괜찮았습니다. 웰컴 아이스티와 쿠키도 맛있었고 애들도 좋아했어요.한가지 단점이라고 한다면 주차인데.. 이 호텔 입구 바로 오른쪽 주차장에 대었더니 거긴 지정 주차장이 아니라더군요. 지정주차장은 한 블럭 떨어져 있다는데 옆 주차장이 호텔스닷컴에 사전 공지된 주차요금 수준 (24시간 55달러) 이어서 수긍은 했습니다.하지만 이럴줄 알았다면 미리 스팟히어로 같은 서비스로 근처 사설 주차장에 주차하는게 싸게칠 것 같네요.,Aug 18| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
Nous avons séjourné à l’hôtel du 12 au 14 août dernier! L’hôtel est très bien situé alors je recommande. La chambre est petite mais les lits sont confortables et comme nous ne sommes pas beaucoup dans la chambre c’est ok! Plein de resto au alentour alors il y est facile de trouver petit déjeuner! Le café Keurig est disponible. Il y a 2 bouteilles d’eau payantes 3$ us chaque ce qui est exagéré... nous ne les avons pas utilisé et l’hôtel nous les a chargé sur ma carte de crédit...alors j’ai dû faire des démarches pour faire canceller le 8|20$ can sur ma carte de crédit... je trouve l’hôtel très malhonnête car on m’avait confirmé que je n’avais aucun frais!

킹사이즈 투룸 베드로 예약했는데 침대가 너무 작아요. 그냥 한인타운에 가까워서 먹을걸 사고 그러는데는 좋습니다.,Feb 15| 2019,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

Habitaciones muy pequeñas| pocos servicios en el hotel. Hotel urbano de New York. Tiene lo justo para una estadía en que sólo se va a pernoctar al hotel.,Jan 15| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
Elegí ese hotel por ubicación porque tenía una junta cerca de ahí. Es un hotel muy básico| la habitación es pequeña| hay un pasillo diminuto entre la cama y la tv| me pegue 3 veces con los filos de las jaladeras de los cajones porque no hay espacio| los amenities son de neutrogena. Las sábanas| edredón| toallas| etc no son lo que esperaba. A favor: el personal súper amable y eficiente en checkin y checkout| hay microondas y cafetera| hay café y té en la recepción sin costo| mi habitación era silenciosa. Volvería a quedarme ahí si hiciera muchísimo frío y es lo mas cerca de lo contrario prefiero algo más fashion aunque tenga que caminar.,Jan 11| 2019,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016

The hotel is perfectly located. In front of the hotel you can park your car free of charge over the weekend (starting on Friday at 6pm). What I also did. But I do not understand why the hotel staff was sending me to a park house for ... 56 USD / day ! The room is not big. It was enough for me| but I expected something a bit bigger. I am Hilton Honors member and the hotel did not recognize my membership because I booked through hotels.com...,Oct 4| 2018,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Midtown Park Ave,45 E 33rd St| New York| NY| 10016
