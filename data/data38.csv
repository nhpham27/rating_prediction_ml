Everyone at the front desk were very nice. The only problem I had was housekeeping knocking and entering at 8:00am and again at 10:00am. It only happened on checkout day thank goodness but it was aggravating. They are also not serving breakfast. Which we were fine with we like our sleep lol,Aug 17| 2021,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

This was a nice hotel and the location was perfect! It is not as updated as newer hotels and had an older feeling to it. Even though they said that breakfast in included in the price| they do not offer breakfast and blame it on COVID.,Aug 16| 2021,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
location was great| we didn't like the air conditioning|  which cycled off too frequently. (Fan stayed on but AC compressor would turn off| the room would get warm...annoying if trying to sleep. No complimentary breakfast|  not even grab and go option.,Aug 14| 2021,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
Everything was great except the gdfish left on the chair. Guess the desk chair wasnt cleaned.,Aug 12| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

It was good. I didn't like that we had to pay $66 dollars a day to park after paying $150 a night fore the motel room.,Aug 9| 2021,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
Great value for downtown hotel. Nothing super fancy but the rooms were clean and comfortable. Not having a free breakfast due to covid was the only bad thing about the place. The pool was nice.,Aug 9| 2021,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Hotel was amazing but we park 3 blocks down off rush with parkchirp there scanner dont work so they try to charge you twice. But hotel was great customer service was great also location 5 star,Aug 5| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
I thoroughly enjoyed the flexibility they provided. Especially| Charles at the front desk was amazing. He got me an early check-in despite they were running full.,Aug 5| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
This may not be the fanciest hotel in Chicago| but it was perfect for a casual long weekend in the city.  They have EXCELLENT customer service| very clean and great location.,Aug 4| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
Very nice place,Aug 4| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
Rooms were clean and comfortable.   Staff was helpful and friendly.  Disappointed that coolers with pop and other essentials were lacking products.,Aug 2| 2021,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
Fantastic location.  Quiet area near a hospital.  Parking options were not great| close but expensive.  All elevators were never working so 15 minute waits most of the time.  Only one clerk even during busy times.,Aug 2| 2021,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
Great location.  Rarely did all three elevators work and waited up to 25 minutes.  Not enough front desk staff and manager just stood and watched. Parking is expensive.,Jul 31| 2021,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Room was amazing and the location was fantastic.  With a great ramen shop across the street| two great chicago pizza shops a block away| and water tower mall a skip hop and jump away| downtime was never an issue.Check in was slightly delayed| but with worker shortages post pandemic coupled with lots of late checkouts I'm nothing but sympathetic.As of July 2021 there is still no breakfast due to covid.  The pool and fitness center were operational however and very nice.,Jul 19| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Loved the room set up! I liked knowing no one would come into my room during our stay.  Anything I needed replaced would be left at the door for me.   I wish the “snack bar” area had a better selection of drinks.,Jul 19| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
I've stayed there before and enjoyed it...,Jul 17| 2021,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
We loved that it was a half a block away from Northwestern and the lady at the desk was super super nice. Views from the room where beautiful.,Jul 17| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
Check-In was congested due to it being Friday evening & raining very hard. There was no carts to carry luggage on. So my husband & I had to carry our luggage and packages up to room| where we had to make several trips. Once in the room| cleanliness was good view was beautiful. However| bathroom was very small (we were on in unit 2401) When toilet flush| it had a loud sound. Shower also made loud sound when turning on water. Other than that| the stay was good.,Jul 16| 2021,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Arrival was a nightmare! I reserved a king room at the beginning of May for the weekend after 4th of july and confirmed my reserfation a week before the booking. Despite all of this they had no rooms available in the specifications when i arrived. We were put into a temp room with a broken air conditioner (dissembled) and told that someone would be up to fix it soon after reporting it. After almost an hour I checked back in at the front desk and they said the person was on their way. After going back up i discovered they were moving us to another room...fine. or at least it was fine until we woke up the next morning to find small blood stains on the pillow| sheet and comforter on the bed. Heading tothe elevator to speak with the front again a family knformed us that they had a cockroach in their room the night before. So after missing the first night of a festival AND all the other disturbing happenings I have received no compensation for the chaos and can wholeheartedly say this was the worst travel experience I have ever had.,Jul 13| 2021,1,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

It was a nice hotel| however there was no parking close by that wasn’t 60/90$ a day. We also didn’t know that if you pay with a debit or credit card| you pay $100 a day for a deposit. We were there for two nights & had to pay $200 extra dollars on top of our $400 hotel| for a deposit| that could take up to a month to refund to our card. rediculous.,Jun 20| 2021,2,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

We have stayed here almost every month or so when I come to town to see my doctors at Northwestern.  It always is clean| smells fresh| and no complaints from us.  The desk folk are very polite and helpful.  Walking distance to doctors offices| restaurants| and shopping make it the ideal location.  The views of the city are marvelous| especially at night.  We will be staying again in October and enjoying all this place has to offer.,Jun 16| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Easy to get in and out. Traffic was not bad getting in or out of Chicago. The hotel was very clean and we did not get charged for an extra room key when we were locked out. We also had no problem getting on the elevators since we were on the 23rd floor. And wait times were never an issue.

Hotel has really good soundproof walls| great location| and big spacious rooms. Staff is very nice and they allowed for a late checkout| which was great. The only reason I didn’t give highest excellent rating is because the AC/heater Unit in the room was so loud we couldn’t sleep. Maintenance came and fixed it| or at least tried| but the noise continued and the room actually stopped cooling down to the temperature we set it at. If it wasn’t for that| I would say great stay and I would stay again.,Sep 22| 2020,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Affordable. Convenient location. Chose parking elsewhere to save money - but I do this with any hotel. The staff seemed to be wearing masks and I saw at least one staff member ask a patron to put a mask on when they didn’t already. The room seemed very humid- I’m not sure if the air conditioner didn’t work well| or it was just because it was a rainy day| but things seemed damp which wasn’t great. We were also high enough up (30th floor) that we didn’t really pick up any street noise from below which was good.,Sep 14| 2020,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

For the price and location of this hotel| one would think it would be up to par with other Hilton owned properties| but not the case. I witnessed one particular night staff clerk be rude to multiple guests checking in. The air conditioning in the room was TERRIBLE. Upon checking in| they notify you that you will be charged $100 per night for Incidentals (okay should’ve said so upfront| but whatever)| but then he promptly and bluntly states “and we don’t have parking| breakfast| or room service| plus the pool and gym are closed| so if you were expecting those items too bad.” All of which should’ve been sent in an email prior to checking in. Parking in the lot next door for 5 days was $300| yikes! I have always had great experience with Hilton owned properties| but alas| this one was a bust| and I will definitely chose another hotel upon my next stay in Chicago.,Jul 12| 2020,2,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Parking garage was closed so we hade to pay $55 a night to park at the lot across the street.,Jul 18| 2020,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

For the price and location of this hotel| one would think it would be up to par with other Hilton owned properties| but not the case. I witnessed one particular night staff clerk be rude to multiple guests checking in. The air conditioning in the room was TERRIBLE. Upon checking in| they notify you that you will be charged $100 per night for Incidentals (okay should’ve said so upfront| but whatever)| but then he promptly and bluntly states “and we don’t have parking| breakfast| or room service| plus the pool and gym are closed| so if you were expecting those items too bad.” All of which should’ve been sent in an email prior to checking in. Parking in the lot next door for 5 days was $300| yikes! I have always had great experience with Hilton owned properties| but alas| this one was a bust| and I will definitely chose another hotel upon my next stay in Chicago.,Jul 12| 2020,2,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

This property charged me a whole day that I wasn’t even there. I called to let them know I’ll be arriving early next day and they told me thanks for letting them know. I get there and I was charged for 2 days instead of one. They told me that they had to hold my room. If I would of known that I would of just made a reservation at check in. Instead of online. I called and explained this to them and again they refused to reimburse me. On top of not having any ammennties due to covid. These people are a joke and I’ll never book with them again.

The room was so hot| the air was not powerful enough and you couldn’t turn it cool enough for it to make a difference. The lobby is small and old. The tv was small and only had very basic channels. I thought the standard for hotels was a smart tv for app sign ins and there was nothing on the way too small tv.,May 18| 2020,2,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Booked the hotel the evening of March 12th. For whatever reason the dates were incorrectly submitted for the 26th of March. When i went to check in for the room on the 12th the gentleman stated i didn't have reservations| after looking into it further he caught the problem and said there is no reservation for tonight but its for March 26th. I said thats incorrect i need the room for this evening. He stated he would cancel the booking for the 26th and accommodate me for the evening of the 12th. After checking there were no rooms available but directed me to Homewood suites which is in the same building. I thought nothing more about the cancelation because he stated he handled it IN PERSON. I finally get back home to PA and sure enough 3 weeks later I am charged as a no show for the room the front desk supposedly "canceled" weeks prior.  I called and they stated without proof of him telling me he canceled the room they couldn't issue a refund. Not sure what we as consumers are supposed to do if we cannot go based off of the word of your staff. I guess ill just have to strap a go pro to my head and record every transaction i have to make sure i have that solid proof they need.,Apr 1| 2020,1,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
I like there was a fridge in the room and tge bed was comfortable... I didnt like there was no ice machine on my floor and I had to go 1 floor down to get ice...

When I went out into the hall| they were hurrying away saying it was just room service - they were coming to reset our room as if we had checked out| but we still had another day on the reservation. The hotel only has 3 elevators. During their self proclaimed busiest time of the day| during their busiest checkout (post NBA All Stars)| they took one out of service to move furniture. It was so cramped| and start/stop| my girlfriend became lightheaded. She stumbled exiting the elevator| fell| smashed her face up. Even the EMT's couldn't get in easy. Then no one - not a single hotel person asked if she was ok upon our return. They all just stared at the floor and ignored us.

The coffee/tea area was dirty and not stocked. I had to ask twice for this to be handled. Overall| the common areas of the hotel; hallways and elevators were always dirty.

Property condition is not satisfactory| furnitures/equipments are worned out| building itself kind of pretty old and carpets need to be cleaned.

The room| breakfast and fitness center were all very nice. Our room was a tad bit noisy with street noise (mostly sirens several times through the night) and we were on the 32nd floor.  We had to wait a few extra minutes for the elevators during the breakfast and checkout rush.  All the staff I interacted with were very good| but we didn't need anything in the room (it was well done from the start).,Nov 11| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
The best thing about this property was it’s location. The rooms are in need of a makeover| furniture very run down. My bathroom had a leaky toilet| someone was sent up to fix it but all they did was turn the water pressure down making it difficult to flush. There was annoying gnats flying in the bathroom| probably because of the toilet issue making it impossible to shower or do anything in the bathroom in peace!  After my rocky check in I really just wanted to go to another hotel| but the prices were really expensive. I’ve always heard rave reviews for the Hampton Inn| but my experience just wasn’t that.😔,Nov 11| 2019,2,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Location is great and this humble three-star hotel competes marvelously with the surrounding four-star hotels. I stayed at a nearby four-star hotel nearby for the first leg of the trip because there was no rooms available at Hampton Inn so I can confidently say that this hotel does a much better job of making sure you feel like your money was well spent. Also there's coin laundry site- BYOP (bring your own pod) $2 per pod..lol.,Oct 29| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Stayed for 4 nights and the front desk staff was awesome especially Alejandro. Everyone always greeted us with a smile and asked if we needed anything. Breakfast was good and there was always plenty of food and the staff there were also great. When the elevators got congested during the breakfast hour the hotel staff took guests to other elevators to speed up the wait for the elevator. Our room was great along with our view.

Not good business- they should've offered us some sort of discount or something,Oct 9| 2019,2,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Stayed for 4 nights and the front desk staff was awesome especially Alejandro. Everyone always greeted us with a smile and asked if we needed anything. Breakfast was good and there was always plenty of food and the staff there were also great. When the elevators got congested during the breakfast hour the hotel staff took guests to other elevators to speed up the wait for the elevator. Our room was great along with our view. Great location. Would definitely stay here again!,Oct 5| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Hotel is located in fantastic spot to everything downtown. Breakfast buffet was a bit of a zoo and elevators were hard to get a times (forced to use stairs from 28th floor on more than one occassion after waits of 15 minutes plus). But price and location made up for it.,Sep 16| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Very disappointed| the faucet in the bathroom dropped all night| not matter what you did| I couldn't get it to stop dripping. I had to put a towel in the sink so I didn't have to listen to it all night. Then in the morning I went to shower in the zero entry shower. The drian was plugged. Water was running all over the bathroom in minutes. Then 2 more people had to shower. Talk about a nightmare. Then to get ready to go in the pool of water.

I like the location of the hotel. The staff was very nice and accommodating. The elevator wait was very long and frustrating. Need more access to elevators. The pool was extremely dirty| the sides of the pool were slimy and dirty. I would suggest an a hot tub or jacuzzi. The hotel was expensive| so the amenities should reflect this.

You could not get better customer service! The staff are AMAZING! It is a large hotel 40 floors with a rooftop pool which you Should use in the warmer months. Elevators get busy especially during breakfast and checkout/check in times BUT they do there best to help out and make sure you don’t wait a long time.  The only issue is location is great for shopping and some sites  but you need to walk 15-20 mins to nightlife and other major stuff| not an issue necessary but something to consider. It’s also a very safe area police present and it’s always busy even late at night so there is no worries or even any issues. Overall it’s a great place and I’d stay again.  Oh! Breakfast is fantastic for free breakfast!,Aug 12| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Overall our stay was great! We stayed 2 nights| after night 1 we switched rooms. There was a banging noise that kept us awake most of the night. Staff was very helpful and understanding and moved us to another room. The ONLY issue was the valet| when I went to leave. I handed the young attendant my claim ticket and he tried to hand it to another young. It appeared as neither of them wanted to get my vehicle. 40 minutes later my vehicle is brought to the entrance. I had to ask for my keys| as I stood right next to the podium. They attendant watched me load all of our luggage and bags into the vehicle alone. He never said| one word to me from beginning to end. Not a hello| goodbye| or thank you! Robert the bellman was great| but was busy with someone else. All of the other staff went above and beyond. What makes me even more upset| I tipped the young man. Now| I sit here wondering| If I am crazy? I believe in being a good person| who takes others into consideration. I have taught my children to always be kind| go out of your way to help others. Say please and thank you. Always use your manners| it shows| they are complemented ALL the time. So| aside from that| our stay was wonderful.,Aug 11| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
The location is great| walking distance to nearly everything. The rooms are pretty big and beds are pretty comfortable.Staff is ok| one of our rooms smelled like cigarettes the moment we walked in. It was a very very small  room too. I called and  let them know of the smell asked to be moved and they did. Rooms are all supposed to be non smoking by the way.  if you’re staying closer to the elevator| you can hear the elevator going up and down at every hr especially early morning. The downfall are the elevators| it gets very busy and ppl wait for elevator for 30 min. During breakfast time. Elevators are shared between Hampton Inn and Homewood Suites.,Aug 10| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
Older hotel in the Streeterville district.  Great location| comfortable beds and quiet| but the elevators were always grossly overcrowded and slow...so slow we ended up taking the staris most times| which from the 14th floor was no small feat. Also| the free breakfast area either needs to be made larger or monitored better. Both mornings there way too many unsupervised children...which is a recipe for disaster when they're handling a scorching hot waffle maker by themselves. 🙁,Aug 10| 2019,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

The downfall are the elevators| it gets very busy and ppl wait for elevator for 30 min. During breakfast time. Elevators are shared between Hampton Inn and Homewood Suites.,Aug 10| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
Older hotel in the Streeterville district.  Great location| comfortable beds and quiet| but the elevators were always grossly overcrowded and slow...so slow we ended up taking the staris most times| which from the 14th floor was no small feat. Also| the free breakfast area either needs to be made larger or monitored better. Both mornings there way too many unsupervised children...which is a recipe for disaster when they're handling a scorching hot waffle maker by themselves. 🙁,Aug 10| 2019,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

The location is good. The beds are very comfortable and the breakfast is a really nice breakfast. Exactly what you would expect from a Hampton. The only drawback with this hotel is the elevators. There are 3 but it is not nearly enough to handle the guests. So I would request a low floor room Incase you need to take the stairs. We walked down from the 20th floor and there was another couple ahead of us that was carrying luggage.,Aug 3| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
The property was in a great location but the lobby was small and always crowded| the pool area was very old and needed a good cleaning and our room was old and tired looking.

Our family enjoyed a great stay at the Hampton. I very much appreciated the friendliness of staff. The location was just perfect in terms of walking distance to all attractions| or a short Uber ride. The breakfast spread was a great spread which everyone enjoyed| and it was kept hot and well stocked. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would come back. A few recommendations would be to turn down the AC in the halls| turn the pool heater on and bigger towels.,Jul 28| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Great location.  Easy to get to (as long as you don't mind city driving).  Parking is in a garage next door.  $39 per day if you take the car in yourself.  The garage attendant told us that it was $69 per day if you valet with the hotel (didn't confirm this with the hotel).  Easy walk anywhere in downtown Chicago (<30 min).  Super friendly staff.  Clean| spacious rooms.  Housekeeping straitened everything each day.  We were on the 38th floor so not too much traffic noise.  The hotel is next door to a major medical center.  Even on the 38th floor there were quite a few ambulance sirens.  Not loud enough to bother anyone.  Complimentary breakfast was simple| but very nice and generally not too crowded.  Rooftop pool and exercise rooms were cool!  Getting on the free WiFi was a bit of a challenge and you were kicked back to a login screen every night| but overall it was good.  Would stay again without question.,Jun 22| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
Property is centralized in the heart of downtown Chicago.  Closed to everything| all the shopping| restaurants.  The staff was extremely friendly and very professional.  We had issue with our bathtub and they fixed the problem better than how I imagined.  The hot breakfast was also great.  They have different menus every day.  EVERYTHING was beyond our expectations & imagine.  Would recommend to all the travelers out there.  We definitely will stay there again next time.,Jun 22| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

We are a family of 3 persons and had a comfortable & convenient stay at the property located centrally in the Royal Mile area from 7 - 10 June 2019. The hotel is within short walk from some Chicago main attractions such as the River walk| John Hancock tower| Tribune tower etc. The hot breakfast provided was good & healthy. The room was spacious and had a pleasant décor with all necessary amenities. There were many good dining options around the hotel as also the Water town Mall for shopping and the shops located in the Royal Mile.The only thing we had to be careful is that the less number of lifts available in the property resulted in longer waiting time during morning breakfast time & check-out / check-in times. So| we tried and used the lifts avoiding the congestion times so that we could quickly come down from our 19th floor room while going out of the property.Overall| a good value for money hotel to stay & explore in Chicago.,Jun 21| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
I thought parking was included in my three day stay. Was charged $117 This should be made clear before booking. Will not be returning there again,Jun 20| 2019,1,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
I liked the location of this hotel| as it was only about an hour bus ride from O'Hare| a short walk to the pier (about twenty minutes)| and we could usually find any bus we needed with less than a five minute walk. The room was spacious with a nice desk| large sofa| and mini fridge (but sadly no microwave). We didn't have very many issues with noise at night or early in the morning so we either got lucky with quiet neighbors or the walls did a good job blocking sound. Breakfast was pretty tasty and offered a good amount of variety during our stay of three nights. My only real complaint is that getting to breakfast in the morning can be a hassle since there are only two elevators and forty something floors| but it wasn't that big of a problem.,Jun 20| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Extremely overpriced!! Room seemed clean but very old and dingy looking. Bathtub didn’t drain well and the hardware was coming off all of the bars in the shower. The ironing board was also very low to the ground when fully opened| making it very uncomfortable to use.  I’m assuming this was a handicap equipped room (which is the only explanation for the low ironing board) but I did not need this type of room| nor was I made aware of this fact upon booking. I expressed my disappointment upon check-out and all I was told was that I should contact Hotels.com so that they could let the hotel know my concerns. Not an adequate response given the amount of money the hotel made from this booking. Very disappointed in the hotel and Hotels.com for that matter.

Fab hotel| amazing location for shopping! The view of the Magnificent Mile is incredible. Front desk staff weren't super friendly or accommodating. I asked for a late check out as my daughter had a vomiting bug and they requested I pay a full night's accommodation. I managed to reduce the charge to 50 dollars.

Very worn out room - small and unwelcoming. Shocker -if you have a car | you will be charged a daily rate of $63.00 - that’s right - sixty three dollars. You could find that kind of money for a 4 star hotel with a parking in Chicago. My recommendation - stay away from this place. Not worth of a penny of your money. Plus | it’s a rip-off!!!!!,Apr 29| 2019,1,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
The only downside to the hotel was that the pool was outside and we could not use it because it was so cold.,May 1| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Fab hotel| amazing location for shopping! The view of the Magnificent Mile is incredible. Front desk staff weren't super friendly or accommodating. I asked for a late check out as my daughter had a vomiting bug and they requested I pay a full night's accommodation. I managed to reduce the charge to 50 dollars. Despite this - I would stay here again - location is fantastic and breakfast not too bad either!,Apr 30| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Bathroom floor not clean. Floor not vacuumed| I am a Hilton honor member and love staying at a Hilton property but was not pleased with this  hotel. We also parked in valet and the people were rude and not helpful with my car,Apr 29| 2019,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Says buffet breakfast and was so small and the worst hotel breakfast| the food was so cold had to go microwave it all| had limited choices and just everything did not look good and were even out of milk first thing at breakfast. Very expensive parking($63.00)| small rooms and bathroom shower drain didn’t work so as showering tub kept filling up which was hard for multiple people to get in and shower.

No hot water and the elevators take forever.,Apr 10| 2019,2,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
This place is in a great location| the amenities are as expected| and the views of the city are really nice. I could even see a tiny sliver of the lake. Free breakfast and WiFi are a huge plus. And the staff members are incredibly kind and accommodating| Alfredo even offered to loan me his phone charger. However| keep in mind a couple of things: 1) There are only 3 elevators for 40 floors and 2 hotels. It can take a long time to make it up and down. 2) This is a more affordable hotel which means it is FULL of folks under 25. If you don’t mind them loudly returning at 2am| or retelling their escapades in the elevator (in graphics detail) in the morning that’s great| if you’re older and more low key| or have little kids maybe spring for somewhere more expensive to avoid them. 3) Finally| there is an ongoing protest at Cambria (north facing side of the building) and I could hear their drums even on the 35th floor. So| if you’re looking for somewhere quiet this might not be the place. All in all| it was what I needed with only a few minor inconveniences.,Apr 8| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
I like the fact that the property is so close to the mile.  However| the breakfast although free is soooooo crowded that it made eating unpleasant.  In addition| the cost of  parking is INSANE.  I feel like as a hotel customer there should be a break on the parking.  In addition| there is a self-park lot the next block down that I found where I could park for a 1/3 of the price you guys charged.,Apr 8| 2019,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
Thre staff were extremely helpful. Thank you!

The elevator was insanely slow!! the first morning we waited over 15 minutes| day two someone came to get us and take us down the service elevator so we would not have to wait so long. I have stayed at many hotels in large cities for conferences and have never had to wait so long. Having to plan an extra half-hour to my morning to make sure that I could get to my conference on time was very frustrating.,Apr 2| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
I first received the incorrect room type. I was told that because I book through Expedia I was not guaranteed the room. However that did not state on the website. I was given the correct room after complaining. Then the elevators broke down on my stay and I had to wait over 15mins to get to the lobby.

Location is perfect! Check-in was fast. Common areas in great condition & fabulous breakfast! However| the elevator situation in the mornings is horrible. If you can’t use stairs due to physical or luggage reasons I’d consider staying elsewhere. We waited over 15 minutes on 17th floor for an elevator. 1st time| a staff member came by & took us back to use (a very dirty) service elevator. We were greatful| but I find it sad the staff have such a dirty elevator to use for themselves. 2nd time we had to catch a train & couldn’t get to first floor with our luggage! Even allowing an extra 30min for elevator traffic we would have missed the train if I hadn’t thought to call front desk & ask to send someone to take us to the service elevator again! They happily & promptly responded| but I can’t imagine how many folks are affected by this-at breakfast & for catching planes! Also| while amenities tick all the boxes| they are cheaply done and/or in need of repair. Our bathroom shower looked as though a handyman was halfway through an instalatiom job. It worked perfectly| but gaping| unfinished hole around pipe/fixture. Bathroom smelled of cigarette smoke. Baseboards in the hall were unstuck- a few feet long| and other unrepaired issues that detracted from the price of the room.,Mar 26| 2019,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

great experience overall : great food| location |services. the only thing weird is the cleaners always knocking in your door even though it already says " do not disturb " sign outside the door. They did it everyday !! its a bit annoying..,Mar 8| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
Great location. Able to walk everywhere needed to go. Shows shopping movie and restaurants just a couple minutes walk| nice even in the cold. Great 1st night| very friendly at the desk on Friday. Not so much on Sat. 2 trips to desk with a pretty basic question and got attitude twice. Uncalled for| I was pleasant. Intrigued into going to the hotel bar for a nightcap. Dirty glasses and an inattentive bartender answered the question. Better time at Fridays around the corner.If going again I would ask for room on front side of building. Sat morning started at 7am with drums and a bullhorn protesting the Cambria on other side. We had a high floor and it was still terrible. Not hotels fault but rather unpleasant anyway.,Mar 8| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Arrived at with temps -40 outside. A wonderful welcome from both John and Alfredo who were both very concerned I was fine. My room was next to the lift shaft but I was moved straight away.Free breakfast everyday is not to be missed| pastries|cereal|coffee/tea| then a selection of hot items including scrambled eggs and sausage etc.Needed to speak to a receptionist on leaving the hotel for the day and encountered one of the rudest staff members| Annmarie| please be aware your rudeness has an impact| I couldn’t have been more pleasant or friendly to you so didn’t deserve your unfriendliness in return!!! This encounter though was soon forgotten as I then met Lynette who I think was security/ customer service. What a lovely lady and I so enjoyed our little chats each morning. I used the excellent gym each day with the magnificent views over the city. Location is fantastic| 30 seconds to the Mag mile and lots of restaurants and sandwich bars nearby. Red Line subway 5 minute walk. (Chicago)On the last day I was given a late check out until 12| I then left my case in the hotel storage area and was allowed to relax on the mezzanine floor until I was picked up at 1.30 for my flight home to London.No surprise incidentals eg $30 extra a night resort fee that some hotels add on|so breakfast| gym| coffee in room etc were really all included in price of the room.A fantastic stay and thank you to the amazing friendly helpful staff (except 1) You were amazing!|,Feb 7| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Amazed by the Kind and friendly / personal touch check in by John at front desk !He made the slightly dated hotel work - reservation for restaurant- room upgrade - genuine conversations and LGBT friendly !,Jan 19| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Close to Hospital was perfect for my visit. However| my room was very humid to the point of an extreme amount of condensation on the window's interior. Needless to say my sleep was very uncomfortable. Breakfast was reasonable. I have had better and I have had worse.,Jan 7| 2019,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
The property and room was very nice. The bathroom however was cramped with no fan. The parking costs were ridiculous! Way overpriced.,Jan 7| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
Great hotel| location is perfect right around the corner from the Mile and the Nike Store. Tons of resturants nearby including a resturant connected to the hotel with a daily 4PM happy hour. Room was great with extremely comfy beds. Great views and other amentities like a delicious daily breakfast.

There was mice in my room and the manager didn’t want to refund me my money. The manager on duty| John has very poor customer service skills and no empathy towards the guests.

I was promised 2 rooms side by side and when I reserved the second room| was transferred to their very aggressive sales team trying to sell me a prepaid vacation.  After 10 minutes of listening to the information i| i decided the package wasnt for me and politely declined. The sales girl would not accept my declination and became increasingly aggressive| even insulting me. I finally just hung up.  When I arrived to check in| i was notified that they could not accommodate 2 rooms next to each other and couldn't even get us on the same floor. So I canceled the second room and requested a roll away.  They were unable to accommodate the roll away because there was no staff to deliver it.  Then we got to our room and it was quite cold. I turned the heat up| but it did not run.  Since I was sleeping on the floor| i spent a very cold and uncomfortable night. (I assumed there would not be staff to check our heat if there wasn't staff to deliver a rollaway).  In the morning our room was 60 degrees and I called the front desk. Maintenance came and said the heater was broken and spent some time working on it. The second night of the stay was much better. The heat worked and I had a roll away. The wait time for the elevators was almost 15 minutes and we were 37 floors up| so we couldnt haul our luggage up the steps.

For the expense of this hotel I was not satisfied at all!! I have had bigger hotel rooms in New York and overseas!!! They literally charged to call for room service and then also charged additional for parking and each time you need to get your car out. They charged for everything I was surprised they didnt charge to flush the toilet. Staff was very friendly or useful either they acted like you were putting them out of the way if you needed anything! And one thing which was totally out of control of the hotel was protesters banging drums from the break of dawn and blocking walk ways made it really un Pleasant.,Oct 7| 2018,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

First time visiting Chicago from Indy. We were attending concerts for two nights during the week and this hotel was a great choice. Close to shopping/dining and a short Uber ride to the venue.

Great location in downtown Chicago close to the Magnificent Mile. Complimentary breakfast with lots of options. Hotel could have been a cleaner in the common areas. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Elevators are tiny and have no air conditioning. Prepare to wait for an elevator for at least 5 minutes. A few of the hotel staff were not very helpful and check in was delayed by a half hour. There were hotel staff striking outside the hotel; I would not have booked this hotel if I would have known there was a strike occurring.,Sep 26| 2018,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

I wouldn't recommend this hotel.  About the only positive is that the bed was super comfortable.  The room had a light moldy/musty smell.  The way the shower is set you literally have to stand against the wall to shower.  The rooms have those old blow out heater/cooler which I always get a cold from.  Breakfast was fine but the room was so insanely crowded and the food set up was weird.  People were knocking into each other trying to get stuff.  All in all just an incredibly uncomfortable dining area.  The staff were not exactly pleasant or helpful.  I could not get on the internet following the directions that popped up on line when I first tried.  When I asked the next morning apparently there were directions to get on a different way other than what shows up on your computer.  Not sure why they didn't give me the directions at check-in.  Over all - a very ENH stay.  There are much nicer hotels in the city for the same price!!,Sep 19| 2018,2,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
Hotel was under strike & waited a long time for valet before they came out and told me.  Manager said he wouldn’t charge me but they did & that manager wasn’t there when I checked out,Sep 18| 2018,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Our room turned out to be wonderfully spacious with comfy beds and a large window front with a view of Willis Tower. The complimentary breakfast was good. Contrary to what art reviewers wrote| we never had to wait for the elevators. The staff was friendly and helpful.,Sep 19| 2018,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

My daughter had an Oncologist appointment at Northwestern and we woke up to a shower that did not work and a phone that was not working to even call the front desk for assistance. Outlets in the room were also not working. It was at best a 3 star mediocre hotel with a 5 star price tag!,Sep 6| 2018,2,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
We went to Chicago for a concert with friends who were also staying at the hotel. When we able to get into our room we noticed it was rather warm in our room but figured it was because the blinds were not closed. We lowered the thermostat and notified the front desk who said someone would check on it. We left and went to do some sightseeing| came back and our room was STILL warm. Called down again and had someone check it once again. He felt the air coming from the vent and said "It's blowing out air. I don't know what more you want." After he left we lowered the thermostat even lower and left for the evening to the concert we came into town for. Came into the room and it was still warm! It was hard to sleep and felt it was useless to call guest services because we were going to get the same "repairman" (If that's what you want to call him.) Our friends rooms were the same way and we were sweating just waiting for the elevator!,Sep 5| 2018,2,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
The pool| which is on the 40th floor| is amazing.  It has magnificent views of the city and is open to the sky.  Incredible.  The location couldn't be better.  Beautiflu hotel.,Sep 4| 2018,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

The bathroom tub had a big tear in the surface and the build up on the showerhead was unsightly.   I ended up cleaning the showerhead before use. There were also large stains on the wall under the sink.  The wait times for an elevator can be long| but the staff open up the service elevator during peak times (i.e. the breakfast rush).

Location is great!  Staff was friendly and very good to deal with.  We arrived early and the hotel looked after our luggage until we returned to check in.  Check in was quick and easy.  Free breakfast was included.  Lots of hot and cold variety at breakfast.  Could have someone walking around wiping tables as people leave as it was busy.  The rooms were huge!  We had two queen beds| sofa bed| cocktail table| desk| big room off the bathroom.  The view was some more buildings but that was a great view at night.  We were right by the hospital so we thought the sirens would keep us awake but they didn’t.  The housekeeper was very friendly and actually asked if there was anything we needed.  The location of this hotel was perfect.  Close to plenty of restaurants and the Hop on Hop off bus.  Would definitely stay here again.

My daughter didn't like the pull out mattress and put the couch back together and slept on it as a sofa.  The breakfast was the real deal with hot bar| oatmeal| and waffles. The other reviews warned of a slow elevator.  It was slow| but we expected this.  I found the other guests friendly and we chatted while waiting.  Lots of other families were staying there too.

This hotel’s entrance outside was an ashtray and an ugly planter. Not a good welcome. Reception said gym opens at 10 am and that maintenance would have to let me in if I wanted go earlier. Slow elevators. Just not that nice| but price reflects that.,Aug 18| 2018,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
Had a doctor appointment at northwestern so chose to stay the night here. Breakfast was the only disappointment. Very crowded and quality not very good.,Aug 18| 2018,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
The housekeeper just unlocked the door and came in without knocking. The sink in the bathroom drained really slow like it filled up to the top from just brushing my teeth.,Aug 18| 2018,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Very friendly staff; hotel is within walking distance to everything we wanted to see; the river walk and the shore line walk are a stone’s throw away.,Aug 17| 2018,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
Loved the hotel and the area was close to everything. My only gripe was the $60 / night parking fee and the morning we left I called ahead to get my car and they brought the wrong car and then argued with me that it was my car... I waited 45 minutes before they brought my car down.,Aug 17| 2018,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
I stayed with my girls 10 and 13.  The pool was really fun.  The room was nice.  I got a king bed with a sofa bed.  My daughter didn't like the pull out mattress and put the couch back together and slept on it as a sofa.  The breakfast was the real deal with hot bar| oatmeal| and waffles. The other reviews warned of a slow elevator.  It was slow| but we expected this.  I found the other guests friendly and we chatted while waiting.  Lots of other families were staying there too. The location was great.,Aug 19| 2018,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

This hotel has a great location| and had a great price. Everything was great| but guests should be aware of the issues they have with their elevators. I have never been to a hotel that openly warns you with signs in the elevator| and lobby about the speeds and wait times for elevators. I found that odd until I tried to get on an elevator in the morning. Every morning we waited in excess of 15 minutes for an elevator down. Some mornings we would wait for 4 or 5 elevators that were full of people. Normally I would not have waited and would have just taken the stairs but I have two small kids. One morning we took the stairs down to the private elevators on the 13th floor and rode those. Another morning after waiting for 20 minutes| with literally a line of people on our floor waiting to get down| so we took the elevator up (getting an up elevator happens instantly| going down is where the wait is) to the top floor and then rode it down past all the waiting people. The hotel itself is great| but be prepared to have your mind blown with how inefficient their elevators are. Maybe the price reflects that| but your sanity will be tested and you will wonder whether spending a few more dollars to ensure having a timely elevator in the morning is worth it.,Jun 24| 2019,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Les prestations sont conformes à ce qu’on peut attendre : chambres spacieuses| bons lits| café à disposition...Sa piscine panoramique est un plus non négligeable selon la saison et son restaurant associé est tout à fait bon.Seul le parking est un peu cher et la solution alternative| à côté de l’hôtel| plus abordable est à considérer avec beaucoup de précautions ( vérifier les horaires sur tickets avant de quitter la place !!!),Jun 17| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Super chambre très spacieuse et excellent service. Bon compromis pour rester pas trop loin à pied (20min) des centres d’intérêts downtown. Pour la chambre où j’étais la robinetterie est à remplacer ou réparer. Le mitigeur du lavabo fuit et il faut forcer pour l’utiliser.,May 26| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

This hotel has a great location| and had a great price. Everything was great| but guests should be aware of the issues they have with their elevators. I have never been to a hotel that openly warns you with signs in the elevator| and lobby about the speeds and wait times for elevators. I found that odd until I tried to get on an elevator in the morning. Every morning we waited in excess of 15 minutes for an elevator down. Some mornings we would wait for 4 or 5 elevators that were full of people. Normally I would not have waited and would have just taken the stairs but I have two small kids. One morning we took the stairs down to the private elevators on the 13th floor and rode those. Another morning after waiting for 20 minutes| with literally a line of people on our floor waiting to get down| so we took the elevator up (getting an up elevator happens instantly| going down is where the wait is) to the top floor and then rode it down past all the waiting people. The hotel itself is great| but be prepared to have your mind blown with how inefficient their elevators are. Maybe the price reflects that| but your sanity will be tested and you will wonder whether spending a few more dollars to ensure having a timely elevator in the morning is worth it.,Jun 24| 2019,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
L’emplacement de l’hotel Est parfait pour le magasinage et à distance convenable pour toutes les attractions à pied Ce que j’ai le moins aimé est la propreté de l’hôtel les tapis sont vieux dans les chambres et machine à café désuète,Jun 24| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
