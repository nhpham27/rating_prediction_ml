The most awesome breakfast and staff that knows how to serve you. For the evening you can sit at the bar in the open atrium and again great service.,Aug 18| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868
The room was great| bathroom was clean| and the bed was cozy. The outside hallway with the large view of the entire lobby and dining room were amazing. And they serve free breakfast every morning. But the only small problem they did not provide are basically the free Disneyland shuttles. Probably because the hotel itself is located a little further south and on the other side of the freeway outside from the Disneyland resort. Other than that| the stay there was terrific.,Aug 18| 2021,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868
Front desk is easily accessible. Quick check in .Less than 5mins.,Aug 18| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

Waited on elevators for 40mins| the cleaning staff got on the elevator before guests| everything looks shabby and beat. The coffee maker was dirty where you put the water. The door to the room didn't close properly.,Aug 15| 2021,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

Great spacious room that we had on the 6th floor. Clean and the breakfast is what you expect. Parking cost about $30 per night.,Aug 12| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868
Nice property overall. Very welcoming atrium style hotel inside. Check in was fast and easy. Two things that I would like to see is a shuttle to Disneyland and hotel rooms that close my quietly and gentle. Other guest next to our room would just let the door slam even in the middle of the night which was very annoying.,Aug 11| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

The hotel was clean and neat. When you walk in you can tell it’s a nice place to stay. The rooms was fresh and clean and made the stay relaxing.,Aug 10| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868
Embassy Suites always deliver| great breakfast and nice to see the happy hour back. Only bad thing was $26 a day to park was not listed in original booking.,Aug 9| 2021,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868
Check-in was a breeze.  Lobby and entrance was pretty grand.  Elevators seemed old. Popcorn ceilings| a little dated but overall was a comfy stay.  I can see why people would write bad reviews about this place but it’s not THAT bad. Certainly better than most hotels and motels. The room they gave us slightly smelled like cigarettes| plugs in the bathroom didn’t work| phone in the living room didn’t work| felt a little muggy. I just called front desk to be moved to another room and they did no problem.  Our other room we had no complaints.  The staff was pretty helpful.Tried to access my email at their business center to print something but they still used internet explorer and it had some sort of restricted access. What’s the point of a business center if the computers won’t even let you access your email?  I just sent my documents I needed to print to the company email and they printed it for me.  At least they can do that.,Aug 9| 2021,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

Its 2021 and the best TV service/remote you could provide was THE SLOWEST moving channel changing access since 1975?  Come on| upgrade your service there... And the Angels game wasn't part of the TV package?  Angels play literally right across the street... really?  Bush league at best there...,Jul 28| 2021,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868
Came for an Angels game. It was close enough to walk!  Wish the bar had stayed open later. We were looking forward to a celebration drink after the “win” and it was already closed.

Unless things change do not waste your money. Our stay was awful. The elevator was broke our whole stay so we had to pile in the service elevator with no AC and 15 other people and we had to wait 30 minutes at a time just to use it. The staff had no answer's when the elevators would be fixed. We stayed on the 10th floor there is no AC up there and it was horribly hot. The rooms AC was barely working so we had some hot nights of sleeping. The breakfast was nice but over at 9! So no sleeping in on vacation if you want to eat. The parking! After getting back from Disneyland... there was none! And u had to pay for it to go park in another parking lot that wasnt the hotels then wake up at 6 to move your car so you dont get towed. It says they had room service they don't none of the phone system worked in the hotel so you couldn't call for towels call for anything. We had to track people down just to find extra toilet paper. We payed more to get that peice of mind of a better place to stay .. total rip off!

Additionally| we were not told during check in that we had to make a reservation for our room to be cleaned.

When I get to the room I was given the wrong room accommodations of which I paid for. The elevators were broken| there are knives and food in the lobby. There was also food from others guests in our room. I get switched to another room. There are cut phone lines but there’s a community phone in the hall. Now why on earth during a pandemic would you have a community phone in commission and not a personal one? This place is worn and raggedy as hell. As is the lady in front shaped like a penguin.

I hate to think that someone came to my room in the middle of the night and took them. i asked your house keeping to check for them and there is nothing to be found . i also had a small bag with card and some cash which is missing from my bags. could you check on them please ?,Jul 2| 2021,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

Not good due to one elevator not working. We had to use the service elevator multiple times because of long lines to ride the only working elevator. One time I had to wait almost 10 minutes because when it stopped on my floor it was continuously crowded. I was also surprised my room did not have any maid service during my entire stay.,Jul 1| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868
I had an issue with check in and the way the facility was not cleaned. I got charged fees that should have been addressed when I reserved the room online. The elevator did not work so we were constantly going to the service elevator to get to our room. We got charged $26 a night for parking when there was no parking for hotel guests. The hotel stay was unacceptable for the price I paid when I arrived. Inaccurate times for breakfast as well. Just a horrible experience. Will not be visiting this hotel again.,Jun 30| 2021,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868
I’ve stayed at this hotel in the past when going to Disneyland and it was great! But unfortunately this time around there were quite a few drawbacks. Our toilet and fridge weren’t functioning when we arrived. We requested maid service while we would be at Disneyland for the day and they never came to our room. Our room had 6 girls staying in it so we needed more towels and toilet paper which I requested. I called the front desk multiple times in these manners and it took hours to get these drawbacks fixed. I do realize it’s the end of covid and more businesses need to start horsing more| but as a paying guest for a more expensive hotel i feel the money was not worth it.,Jun 30| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868
A very good hotel with good service. Rooms are very clean and comfy. Parking was a hassle if you come in a little late. Only one elevator was working leaving people stranded most of the time (there was a lot of disappointment due to that). Breakfast was very limited (maybe because things are still opening up after Covid). Overall a great stay.,Jun 30| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

Then they gave the audacity to make you pay for parking overnight after paying 350 for a room. Bye.,Jul 4| 2021,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

The bed was comfortable| staff were mostly friendly and the space was roomy. The carpets throughout were dirty and one elevator down resulting in long waits (no stairs avail as as alternative).,Jul 3| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868
the room was on the 5th floor |  there was only one elevator  and the other was broken |  i had a real hard time to get downstairs | as it was full all the time.also my stay was from Tuesday June 29 to checking out on Thursday  July 1st on Wednesday  night June 30th | when i came back to the room | i took off all my jewelry| near the coffee Machine and on Thursday morning when i woke up  | there was none there . i checked all my bags and belongings | to think that .maybe i left it somewhere else and could not locate anything . I hate to think that someone came to my room in the middle of the night and took them. i asked your house keeping to check for them and there is nothing to be found . i also had a small bag with card and some cash which is missing from my bags. could you check on them please ?,Jul 2| 2021,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

Not good due to one elevator not working. We had to use the service elevator multiple times because of long lines to ride the only working elevator. One time I had to wait almost 10 minutes because when it stopped on my floor it was continuously crowded. I was also surprised my room did not have any maid service during my entire stay.,Jul 1| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868
I had an issue with check in and the way the facility was not cleaned. I got charged fees that should have been addressed when I reserved the room online. The elevator did not work so we were constantly going to the service elevator to get to our room. We got charged $26 a night for parking when there was no parking for hotel guests. The hotel stay was unacceptable for the price I paid when I arrived. Inaccurate times for breakfast as well. Just a horrible experience. Will not be visiting this hotel again.,Jun 30| 2021,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868
I’ve stayed at this hotel in the past when going to Disneyland and it was great! But unfortunately this time around there were quite a few drawbacks. Our toilet and fridge weren’t functioning when we arrived. We requested maid service while we would be at Disneyland for the day and they never came to our room. Our room had 6 girls staying in it so we needed more towels and toilet paper which I requested. I called the front desk multiple times in these manners and it took hours to get these drawbacks fixed. I do realize it’s the end of covid and more businesses need to start horsing more| but as a paying guest for a more expensive hotel i feel the money was not worth it.,Jun 30| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868
A very good hotel with good service. Rooms are very clean and comfy. Parking was a hassle if you come in a little late. Only one elevator was working leaving people stranded most of the time (there was a lot of disappointment due to that). Breakfast was very limited (maybe because things are still opening up after Covid). Overall a great stay.,Jun 30| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

Nothing was the fault of the employees (or lack there of)| the employees were all nice and professional| there just wasn’t very many! One person at the desk checking everyone in with long lines. The room was dated with heavily stained carpet and the pull out sofa “mattress” was more of a metal wire frame with absolutely no cushion. COMPLETELY unsleepable!

We were told our room was a downgrade on check-in| with less beds for our group then what we booked| when in all actuality| we were indeed given the room we had booked. Not happy at all until we saw it was indeed the correct room. This property charges a daily parking fee ($26/night)| but there was no parking to be found 2/5 nights. They say there is a parking garage| but you will be towed without an appropriate permit for designated parking| and there were no hotel designated parking spaces in the garage. No refund. Next| we were told breakfast would be served until 10am. I arrived at 9:15 for breakfast| we weren’t the only ones who were lied to. Laundry service: the washer worked| but both of the dryers did not. Front desk would not accommodate drying our clothes and wouldnt refund for what we had payed to dry our clothes. Not only wasted hours trying to dry clothes in dryers they knew didnt work| also had to go to a laundromat as a result of the hotel not being able to provide a service they offer. And once again| no refund. There was only one functional elevator for the entire hotel making getting in and out or around the hotel aggravating. Our room was infiltrated with marijuana and cigarette odor through the vents. Not a fan of either of those smells. Not expected in a non smoking hotel. Went swimming one day| pool is decent| no towels| not many people. Definitely won’t come back.The breakfast was delicious as long as they tell you the correct time.

Entire property is in dire need of complete renovation. Room windows so fogged unable to see out. 1 of 2 Elevators under 3 week maintenance project and had to take service elevator. Other guests stuck in elevator for an hour and fire department let them out. Called for furnace/air conditioning repair 3 times and unit very loud. Little space in parking lot at night. 2 room phones not working and replaced. Microwave had to be replaced. Property sandwiched in between 2 freeways and very loud. No pool towels and staff did not maintain pool area. You can walk to Angels stadium but crossing many lanes on State College street is very dangerous. Small ants on property bushes got into our car at night. Got some credit for bad parking situation.

Jajaja ahorita para ir s Disney tienes que reservar meses antes de ir.Yo estuve en espera en la pagina  de Disney por 15 horas ! A la próxima ya que está todo abierto para todos hacemos un viaje de la familia Astiazaran.First off| the hotel didn’t have hot breakfast on weekdays which was the whole point of reserving this hotel.when I called the property to make sure| they said they did have hot breakfast however it was a limited menu. Second| both hotel elevators were not working and the stairs are for emergency only and we were told not to use them ! So how r we supposed to get to our room when we got back from Disney ??? The fire department was at the hotel when we arrived at 10 pm from Disneyland and people were stuck in one elevator while the other hadn’t been working. They had us go to the service elevator which was packed and we had to wait to get to our room. This whole experience was unacceptable of a hotel. If the elevator isn’t going to work they need to make the stairway accessible. Third| they don’t clean your room.Fourth| there’s no hbo or movie options.The elevator itself was the biggest issue. Guests could not social distance because initially the first day there was one working elevator. Guests were jam packed liked sardines in the elevator because we were waiting 30 min just to get in! Everytime it stopped at our floor it was packed.

The only reason I stay only at embassy suites is for their breakfast and it was not what we are used to. The pool was closed no no Access  in year of limiting access. The room was very clean and layout was good.,May 29| 2021,1,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868
Very clean just sad no made to order breakfast or evening cocktails and drinks due to covid,May 28| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868
It was just a mid week getaway. Very nice hotel and staff was helpful. I will stay again.,May 27| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868
Loved the hotel and how close everything was to it. Was walking distance to the Angels stadium and breweries!,May 26| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868
I didn’t like that parking was $26 for overnight self parking.  I didn’t see it listed on the site.  With that being said| the hotel was pretty good to excellent.  Only had 1 elevator working due to the hotel being refurbished.  I would recommend as it is located right off the freeway and easy to find restaurants and other stores.,May 24| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868
Very nice place and clean rooms.,May 24| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868
The room was nice but there was no free WiFi| no free parking| staff wasn’t very friendly| and it was overall not the best experience me and my spouse have had staying in a hotel.,May 24| 2021,1,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

For the first three nights there wasn’t any housekeeping done| we told the night manager and some housekeeping lady and no one listened until we spoke to the general manager; the parking spaces are very limited| there’s like cero security and once the main parking is full you can park in the back and then you have to jump between cars to get back in the main property| but you still pay for that space.

The door to our room was not a fire door and would not shut on its own. We had to force it to shut which was a problem.

Everything was pretty much good| except the pool situation. My family and I wanted to take the kids in the indoor pool in the morning. I called the day before checkin to make sure that the pool was in fact heated. They assured me it is always heated. Then I read some reviews where they said the pool was cold. So I call again. Different person| similar response.  We get there - the kids are super excited to swim - ice cold! I ask at the front and they say it hasn’t really worked in awhile. They’re waiting for a part. Need to share this information with other staff.,Feb 10| 2020,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

Booked a beautiful suite with a balcony.  Lots of room| very quiet.  Clean facility.  Walking distance to Angels Stadium.  We took advantage of the big breakfast buffet.

The floor in the room was wet in the bedroom roof leaks on the 10th floor manager says hotel is full can’t do anything for a couple days. There made to order breakfast was a joke a best no plates no cups and ran out of food everyday. Worst managed hotel for $200 a night ever and they charge for parking that they don’t tell you about until you get there. The staff said sorry about the issues with the breakfast. They been asking for more plates and cups and food for 4 months at no avail and cut there hours from 8 to 5 Hours’s day in the kitchen and it shows horrible place to stay poorly managed.,Jan 8| 2020,1,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

They claim all found items are returned to lost property department|  but it's been over 10 days and I've not heard from the hotel.

Too many things out of order. No towels at pool| not just one time ( BUT 3 TIMES ). They not more workers and managers need to stop being cheap. I know this business I use to work in it.

The rooms were not properly clean. Breakfast items at the buffet were not replenished and the area around the food was also not properly clean.,Dec 31| 2019,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868
Too many things out of order. No towels at pool| not just one time ( BUT 3 TIMES ). They not more workers and managers need to stop being cheap. I know this business I use to work in it. It’s all about dollars  ... don’t forget the customers . I can go on and on and on. They need to stop being cheap and fix’s this beautiful hotel.,Dec 30| 2019,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

My family used VRBO to get an awesome deal on this Embassy Suites hotel stay. From the very friendly staff| to the cleanliness and size of our room| to the delicious breakfast| this is a great place to stay for your next Disney vacation. Another perk is that they have a shuttle service that picks up right around the corner from the hotel that is the perfect alternative to having to drive and park at the Park. They pick up every 40 mins. This hotel is the first pick up from the hotel and first drop off on your return. I would give this Embassy Suites more than 5 stars| if I could!! Thank you for having a quiet| comfortable| clean place for us to stay after our VERY long| tiring days at Disney!!,Dec 10| 2019,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

It was an ok stay| but definitely not worth the cost per night| plus having to pay $25 a day for parking and 9.95 a day for wi-fi. I've stayed at less expensive hotels that were actually nicer and included amenities| free breakfast| plus free parking and free wi-fi. The pull out sofa bed mattress was terrible for my daughter. It feels like you're laying on a thin piece of cloth over coils. My husband said the bed hurt his back| but it was fine to me.  Breakfast was plentiful| it wasn't great tasting| but it was ok. If you come in late at night| there might not be any parking in the hotel lot| and you will have to park in the lot next door. It happened to us twice. The room was very clean| and front desk service was great. All in all| I wouldn't choose to stay at this hotel again.,Dec 7| 2019,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868
We had to change rooms first room was very diry| blanket on bed had stains| floor was not vacuumed|  crumbs on floor|  phone did not work| and the door to the room was busted| looked like it had been kicked in a few times.

Fees for parking were not disclosed until we arrived. $25 USD per night.  The showers at the pool need new controls as they are worn out.  General cleanliness of the pool and hot tub were below expectations.  The room itself we stayed in didnt have clean carpets with dirt and other foreign material still on it along with stains.  The toilet seat was loose .... this drove me crazy.  Breakfast was great. Food was fantastic. The bed was super comfortable.

I've always liked the Embassy suites in the past. I had some problems a couple years ago at the embassy suite south Anaheim and said I would never go back| However i thought i would give this one another shot| I talked to a Embassy suite Representative on the phone before I got to the hotel a couple weeks before  about some requests. I am a Hilton member as well. When I got to the hotel. The lady at the front desk new nothing about my requests and there was no notes on my check in. they put me in a lower floor room which I have always request highest floor| I also had asked for an early check in do to my fight coming in early and wanted to take my daughter to Disneyland that day. They new nothing about that either and we had to wait. The room was not cleaned very well. it was noisy | One morning at 4:00am I could here them vacuuming and bagging chairs etc. woke me up and  could not get back to sleep. The breakfast. of all the Embassy suites I've been to in the past *been to 5   different ones* This was there worst  and most unorganized breakfast by far. I really like the Hilton hotels and hope to use then again in the future. Thanks,Nov 9| 2019,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

Clean and safe stay. We usually stay in Garden Grove for Disneyland but it was booked. This was a little cheaper and only a 10 minute drive to the parks. This might be our new official spot to stay. Made to Order Breakfast is quick| easy and filling. Parking is a pain| most of the time it is full and you will have to park in the overflow lot (which isn't far but still...who wants their car way off where you can't see it).,Nov 3| 2019,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

Don't get me wrong--hotel staff was great| super friendly. The lobby looks like it was renovated recently. But our room... idk. there were purplish stains on the walls. The couch looked old and brown and had marks all over the cushions from what looked like spills to pen marks. We didn't even want to sit directly on it and asked for extra sheets to cover.

The room was clean. Was kind of upsetting when both phones didn’t work so I wasn’t able to call the front desk. I had to walk all the way downstairs to ask them a question and the girl at the front desk talked was a little rude. coming from someone who works in the customer service she could of been alittle better .

Our first night water leaked from shower out through bedroom door and the phones were out. Second day we were not left any hand towels| wash cloths| coffee accessories were not replenished and ice bucket still had melted water form night before. When we were on our way out we let the front desk know of the discrepancies and he said he would let staff know. When we returned we noticed we left the do not disturb sign on door and when we walked in we had an overabundance of coffee items and towels on table. Still no was cloths and we didn't like the fact that they came in with the do not disturb sign up.  Day 3 came back about 5pm and our room was still being cleaned.  We had to wait 10 minutes to get access to our room. Not ok after a long day and still no wash cloths. My husband went down to desk| because we still had no phone| and they sent up a huge bag of towels ( only 2 of us staying in room) A little overboard if u ask me. He only asked for a couple of wash cloths. We felt the desk staff was good but the cleaning staff not so much. When i asked why room is still being at 5pm she proceeded to tell me about the staffing issues. I interrupted her and stated Not my problem and customers don't need to be burdened with in house issues. We expect to come back from a long day to a room that is clean and supplied with all items that the hotel provides.,Oct 11| 2019,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

Don't get me wrong--hotel staff was great| super friendly. The lobby looks like it was renovated recently. But our room... idk. there were purplish stains on the walls.

The breakfast buffet and evening receptions were fantastic.  The rooms were spacious and clean.  The downside was that there were only two elevators and one was not working for pretty much our entire stay.  The stairs are alarmed so we could not use them as an alternative. As a person who likes to walk| be prepared for at least a 15 - 30 minute walk to get to anything but there is a little shop onsite for snacks.

I was very upset by the fact that they charge $25 per day to park a car. This is a hotel with a large parking lot. It is in California| the land of cars. Guests can’t bring their car up to the room| so they need a place to park. They charge more than enough per night for a room. The parking should be free. I’ll even offer a compromise-$25 for your entire stay,Sep 14| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868
We stayed two nights in a King Suite on the 10th floor. Very comfortable beds with a lot of room through out the suite. Very convenient to the Honda Center.

The hotel| also| has an evening reception nightly that included fresh fruit| snacks and free drinks. I told my husband that you feel like you don't want to leave when your check-out day arrives. I would like to stay here again - only longer than two nights.,Sep 13| 2019,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

We had a nice room overlooking the river. That is about the best I can say. Front desk is not the friendliest and the room was really stuffy. But the worst was when we had to call twice because housekeeping did not put a top sheet on the bed. And when they finally showed up they just handed it to me. I had to remake the bed myself.

I typically stay at Embassy Suites any time I travel because I enjoy the complimentary social hour and made-to-order breakfast.  Both were subpar compared to other Embassy Suites I've stayed at.  The breakfast was more like a continental breakfast that I would expect from a lower quality hotel.  The made-to-order part of the breakfast was very limited compared to other Embassy Suites.  Also| one of the elevators was broken (and there is no stairway access to the 1st floor) so it took us 45 minutes just to get to the breakfast area---time wasted that we could have spent at Disney.,Sep 1| 2019,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

Easy access from two freeways and close to Angel Stadium. Very simple decor. Swimming pools were cold/cool. Food was good| but not hot. Happy hour was too "simple.",Aug 18| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

Hotel is very nice. We got there a bit after 3 and our room wasn’t quite ready which was ok cause check in wasn’t until 4| so they took are number and said they would call us when the room was ready. Which they didn’t it was only until we went up to the counter after 4pm. The elevator is extremely slow| but the breakfast was good and the hotel was clean. I have stayed there before which is why I returned.,Aug 18| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

We loved the sized of the rooms and the balcony. Breakfast is always good! Front desk safe are friendly. Limited parking and having to park in a different parking lot and having to still pay $25.00 a day per vehicle. We called down to the down to the front deck several times about a wasp nest on our balcony. They told us they would send someone up and no ever did. So my husband do the take care of it. Never having washcloths.,Aug 6| 2019,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

We loved the location. It was close to the theme parks. The staff was helpful with the following issues| the first room we were in had a leak in the loght fixture over the bathroom toliet. It was dangerous. They moved us to a room on level 9 that had issues of its own. Half the pligs didnt work| the vent where the ac was fell down in the middle of the night. The safe was out of batteries and the sink leaked water.

You really need to update your sofa bed. We stayed in unit 702 and I had to sleep on the sofa bed for 3 nights. All I could feel were coils pushing against my body. I could even hear the sounds of the coils each time I moved on the sofa bed mattress. Also| if I reserved for 6 people| why are there only 3 bath towels in the room? I had to call for 3 more towels and waited 1 1/2 hrs just to get them.,Apr 23| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

Was disappointed this time. Got there a little early and asked if we could check in they said not until 2 so we left and came back. They were suppose to call me but didn’t. Other people were checking in before us and when it was our turn we still had to wait. Then they ended up giving us a handicap room and the shower was terrible plus we had to ask for towels because there were none.,Apr 22| 2019,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

You really need to update your sofa bed. We stayed in unit 702 and I had to sleep on the sofa bed for 3 nights. All I could feel were coils pushing against my body. I could even hear the sounds of the coils each time I moved on the sofa bed mattress. Also| if I reserved for 6 people| why are there only 3 bath towels in the room? I had to call for 3 more towels and waited 1 1/2 hrs just to get them.,Apr 23| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

Was disappointed this time. Got there a little early and asked if we could check in they said not until 2 so we left and came back. They were suppose to call me but didn’t. Other people were checking in before us and when it was our turn we still had to wait. Then they ended up giving us a handicap room and the shower was terrible plus we had to ask for towels because there were none.,Apr 22| 2019,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

It was our first time staying at this hotel and it was very nice and had friendly staff. Great food and drink menu. Only two things I ddnt like was our door to our room ddnt fully shut due to it being broken/old. Also| our whole stay there our room smelt like weed. It was non smoking room but a guy who stayed there was smoking weed CONSTANTLY that it traveled through the vents and stunk up our room. Unfortunately the staff didn’t take care of that problem as fast as they shld of| so we had to deal with the smell for two days.

Check-in took awhile. There were two people working and neither acknowledged anyone waiting in line. I was not informed about complementary happy hour or breakfast. I was not informed I would be charged for parking. If the check-in process was done correctly I would rate my stay higher. When I got in my room there was one sneaker in the corner of the room from a previous guest. The property is clean. There were lots of people in the pool. Later in my stay I called maintenance because the hot water handle of the sink was loose and I couldn't turn the water off. That experience was nice and well handled. I usually just drop my room key to check out but the valet asking me about paying for parking (even though I parked myself)| so I went inside to chat with someone. I stood in line again| and waited 15 minutes not being acknowledged by front deck staff before I asked if there was someone else that could help me| because there was only one person working. The guy then said he hadn't seen me but would be with me shortly. I waited another ten minutes| 3 more people gathered waiting behind me in this time| I finally caved and just left without my questions being answered.

Great property for a fair price. Stay here you won’t be disappointed!!!,Oct 29| 2018,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

This is a beautiful hotel. Customer service was on point. Breakfast was really good. And then there is the room. Our room was not cleanest floors were dirty microwave was dirty. The worst part was the beds| they were very uncomfortable. We took our kids to Disneyland the last thing you want is to come back from a long day and have to sleep in a uncomfortable bed. We had a sofa sleeper in our room  which we all know probably aren’t all that comfortable this one the kids couldn’t even sleep on. You could feel the springs no padding whatsoever. We had to ask for a roll away it was more comfortable but not much more. The rooms need a make over. We paid over $600 for two night. Not worth it. I’m sure we could have found something better.,Oct 23| 2018,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868
Corner suite was Perfect for Our Family Vacation weekend in Disneyland| The Breakfast was Wonderful!!! Helped Sooo Much| As The Mom of 2 teenagers| your time is Already consumed!! The Beds are Super Comfortable| Tub was on The small side if you are a taller Person| Tub and Shower are separate| So that is helpful for little ones and families... LOVED The Space Definitely Reccomend!!!,Oct 23| 2018,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868
Hotel staff is a joke| I left my wallet at the room and called asking if it was ok to pick it up next day at 7:00 am and the front desk person said yes that there is always a manager on site which it was t true. We arrived at the hotel at 7:25 and we were told that the manager will arrive at 8:00 and that the manager is not always on site. We have an international flight to catch,Oct 21| 2018,1,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

Decent location to Angel Stadium and Downtown Disney.  If you don't mind a zillion kids running around and parents that don't know how to control their said kids| then this place is OK. The lines for breakfast were a bit too long. Only 2 employees working the made to order breakfast for approximately 75 people.  Not too good.  Managers reception was good.  "Light snacks" were mediocre.  Trail mix| gold fish crackers and fruit.  Something hot would have been nice| especially since there was a limited menu for room service due to a closed kitchen.   Staff was great.  Room service and front end were very friendly.  Hotel was a tad dirty.  Kind of expected with a lot of kids running around (Wipe down the elevator doors for goodness sake).  Rooms were OK.  No fans in the bathroom| made for quite of bit of discolorations on the walls and ceilings.  The one thing that bugged us the most was there was a convention in the hotel for travel agents and we continued to be solicited by them for 2 days on investing in a travel agency.  In the future| the hotel needs to tell them to not solicit guests.  Also| our room was very loud with traffic on the outdoor street.  Lots of motorcycles thinking it was a drag strip.  Overall| I would say this place caters more to the family scene vs. a couples weekend getaway.,Oct 2| 2018,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

This is the second time we have stayed at this establishment and had an even better experience this time! We have a large family of 5 children and we won't stay anywhere else when we go to Disneyland! The suite is large enough| comfortable| and priced right. The breakfast is the best I have ever had at a hotel (we have 3 teenage boys so the breakfast saves use easily $50 a day). Now that they have remodeled the outdoor pool and added the Disneyland shuttle FREE (it used to have a charge) there is nothing I would change. Their front desk staff is friendly| courteous| and always go the extra mile.

The hotel provides breakfast between 6AM -10AM & yes at times the lines can be crazy but the staff do their best to accommodate everyone. Most importantly| the hotel has a shuttle that runs every hour to take guest to the Disneyland park (which is very convenient because you don't have to look/pay for parking). There are minor issues like long wait times for the elevator or kids running through the hallways at times or slamming doors but hey kids will be kids....lol Overall we've enjoyed our stay each time.,Sep 4| 2018,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868

HOTEL BIEN UBICADO| BUENA OPCION PARA PLAN DISNEY| COMPRAS| ESTADIO ANGELS.  LOS CUARTOS MUY AMPLIOS| PARA FAMILIAS.   EL SERVICIO DEL HOTEL EN HABITACIONES Y EN GENERAL NO ES BUENO.  PERO AL FINAL NO ES UN HOTEL EN EL QUE ESTES TODO EL DÍA.  SI VOLVERIA A LLEGAR AHÍ POR SU UBICACION Y EL TAMAÑO DE HABITACIONES.  PRECIO Y CALIDAD ES BUENO.,Oct 17| 2018,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton Anaheim Orange,400 N State College Blvd| Orange| CA| 92868
