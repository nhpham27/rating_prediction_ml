The hotel is comfortably located near Central Park. However| if you enjoy luxurious pillows and bed clothing in your room| you will be disappointed. Further| I was surprised to learn that the rooms are not cleaned on a daily basis. The front desk attempted to be helpful and engaging| but often the language barrier was challenging.,Aug 27| 2021,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
The Hotel is good| location is great just 10 minutes walking from times square. Facilities are good| the room was small but confortable. What I didn't like is that there is not housekeeping available| so you have to request for new towels and toilet paper| so during the four days of stay nobody clean our room| it was advised since the check in| but i think they should include the service,Aug 27| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
Centrally located.,Aug 25| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
This hotel allows animals| and my room smelled very strongly of cat urine. Also| my room was in between the elevators| so the noises and the metal scratching from the elevators going up and down all day and night was extremely irritating. I also had a flight cancellation the day I was supposed to check in to this hotel. I called as soon as I could| and I tried to explain the situation. The lady on the phone told me that I was not able to get a change or my money back for the day that I was going to miss in the hotel. I have been trying to use the help messaging center on Expedia.com to try to talk to someone about this| hoping I might be able to at least get a credit for the night that I was unable to use. Every time I enter in my information| the messaging center says that my information does not exist| so I cannot get a hold of anyone to help me with this.,Aug 25| 2021,2,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
This hotel was filthy and disgusting. I changed rooms 3 times after arrival due to the rooms being blantantly unclean. They were sorely understaffed so no one would ever answer the phone at the front desk. Each time I had to wait forever to take the elevator back to the lobby to tell them yet again the room was very unclean. Not once did they express surprise - rather just blamed housekeeping| as though this was an ongoing problem. After the third move| now 11pm| on my own with no assistance| I gave up| slept with all my clothes on and checked out first thing in the morning to move to a new hotel. To their credit they refunded me the night I spent there and the remaining days on my res. I’m still anxiously hoping no signs of bed bugs in my luggage from the one night there.,Aug 24| 2021,1,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
We stayed at this hotel due to the close proximity to the Ed Sullivan theater for the Colbert show. We did not have high expectations of luxury since this is a lower end Hilton brand. It was utilitarian for us and met our expectations just fine. I would not stay there for a longer Manhattan stay as the rooms were small| towels are super thin| A/C didn’t work great and there’s nothing special about the hotel. The nightly rate was very affordable for the area.,Aug 20| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
The hotel is in an excellent location. Some of the staff are very helpful and courteous. A couple of the staff at the desk act as if they don't see you. But the other staff members and maintenance workers are nice. There are restaurants in the immediate area; some pricey but you do have places in which to go if not interested in going to restaurant on premises. We had a hard time closing the bathroom door; had to force closure because floor was warped and door couldn't get over warped area. The bathroom shower would back up each time you took a shower; drain did not properly work so a little pond would form in shower.  I did give them a list of things wrong before I left. I hope they fix them. Also the refrigerator needed to be defrosted.We're so anxious to get out we're accepting anything. Let's get our money's worth.  The business have raised their prices Let's not lower our standards.,Aug 19| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
I didn't like that Expedia failed to alert the hotel of my change of itinerary. I await the refund that is owed me. Afterword: received my full refund to cover any errors made. And Expedia needs to get over the fact that I mentioned their error here. I will not otherwise alter this review.,Aug 19| 2021,2,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
Good location.,Aug 18| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
Hotel is in a great location close to Times Square.  Was not informed that room would not be cleaned each night and had to call to find out and request new towels.  Calls were not answered on multiple occasions.,Aug 16| 2021,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

By far the worst customer service ever!! Never ever gotten that poor customer service! When we arrived we were given a room that was covered in hair everywhere restrooms| beds just plain nasty when I went downstairs to inform the front desk (with pictures) I was told that the was the only room with 2 beds available for the weekend and ended having to pay for a separate room just to accommodate my family 😡😡😡!!,Aug 11| 2021,1,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
The whole stay was frustrating and extremely disappointing| the room looked nothing like the image shown| was tiny with no space to move around. The bathroom door wouldn't close fully as it was too close to the main door so there was a stopper that prevented it from closing fully - if anyone opened the main door and you were in the bathroom| anyone coming in could see right through into the bathroom. Room had a smell from the carpet which didn't feel clean at all with a few stains as well. Tried contacting hotels.com once I had checked in to make them aware of the condition and change my booking to another hotel but was tough to get in touch with an agent.Was a shock to find out there was no housekeeping at the hotel. Was only told of this at check-in without any prior knowledge. Housekeeping was done only once every 5 days - would have never booked the room if I was aware of this. There was no proper breakfast at the property either - again was never informed of this.As a Hilton Honors Diamond member| there was no privileges and was told because I had booked from form a third-party website and not directly through Hilton that there would be no benefits of my membership. Never experienced this at another hotel previously.All in all| was very disappointed with the whole stay and felt deceived by the whole process. Had I known about any of these issues prior to the stay would have never booked my stay at this property. Wouldn't recommend.,Aug 11| 2021,1,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
liked location| and room sizeToo much wait for elevators| weak annoying internet connection| not enough towels changes,Aug 10| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
This hotel is very nice located between Times Square and Central Park. The rooms were spacious for NYC and had a nice shower. Convenient to MTA metro line E that brings you to JFK or La Guardia Airport.,Aug 10| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
WELL they have 3 tiny elevators for the whole hotel…. Only 1 of which worked. So it was not uncommon to have to wait 10/15minutes for an elevator - Often times when it finally came it was already full so you had to wait ANOTHER 10/15minutes. My boyfriend ended up routinely taking the stairs up and down… we were on the 22nd floor. The front desk staff is extremely understaffed. No one ever answers when I called from the in room. Made several requests for towels and never got any. Every time I needed to go to the front desk it was an extremely long wait even if there weren’t many people waiting in line. The rooms were nice though and clean| but everything else is a hot mess and really frustrating to the point where I wouldn’t stay here again…. If not for the elevator situation alone. What you get For the money you pay for these rooms isn’t worth it. I’d be willing to pay more money to stay in the same area but at a different hotel. And I’m pretty easy going.,Aug 9| 2021,2,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
Convenient to walk to other places great location clean outside environment,Aug 9| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
Our stay at the Hilton Garden Inn was fantastic. The room was just right. The air conditioning was cold| shower was roomy and great pressure| and refrigerator was perfect for our snacks. The location was exactly what we wanted| close to everything. Would stay here again!,Aug 8| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
Good location. However| one of the elevators was not working all the time causing unnecessary delays during rush hours. Many gusts do not wear masks despite the spike up in delta variant cases of Covid 19.,Aug 8| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
Convenient location. Felt safe,Aug 6| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
The room was fine and clean. The loby smells and no one cleans your room unless you ask. If you need anything you have to ask.,Aug 6| 2021,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
We reserved two rooms. My wife could not use room key| two consecutive days. There was no clear explanation why this happened and luck of professional hospitality.,Aug 5| 2021,2,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
Everything was good,Aug 3| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
The room was very clean and quiet even though it was close to the elevator.  However| there was no housekeeping available.  We were made aware of this when checking in| but were told that if we needed anything| to call or ask the front desk.  We did just that| asked the person at the front desk for fresh towels and trash pick up.  We left all day| when we returned| no new towels or trash pick up.  We ended up taking the trash out to a dumpster downstairs ourselves.,Aug 3| 2021,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
The front desk staff dont answer the phone when you call with a question or request.  The tv in our room didnt work| so we called down for help…multiple times| no answer.  Finally my husband went down to the front desk where he was ignored while waiting for the front desk person to acknowledge him| even though he was the only person in the lobby. I was calling down to the front desk at the same time| and he said the guy just went back to playing with his cell phone and ignoring my calls in addition to my husband who was standing right in front of him.Eventually he was forced to acknowledge my husband| and said someone would be up to fix the tv| but 45 minutes later still no one had showed.I went down there to give him a piece of my mind and the front desk staff was totally ambivalent about the fact that we were not being taken care of.  I had to stand there at the front desk and wait until my husband upstairs texted me that the repair guy had stopped by.And then even after all that- the next time we turned the tv on| it was broken again.Totally would NOT recommend.,Aug 3| 2021,2,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
Great location. Easy to get to everything New York!,Aug 3| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
Staff helpful and nice. Comfortable beds and clean rooms! The Bistro attached to hotel is very good as well| with a great happy hour!,Aug 1| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
Overall| everything was okay. Staff were friendly though could be more professional. They were behaving more causally. Bathroom and bed were clean when we first went in. Both had everything needed such as towels| soaps| etc. When we checked in| the staff warned us about not giving room service unless requested during our stay. I did end up requesting for more hair shampoo on the second night. The staff gave me 2 more bottles which covered for the rest of my stay. Room size is a bit small| but I didn't mind it too much. The desk lamp light bulb was dead| but didnt need it so didn't request for a change. Microwave had a stain that I easily cleaned off. Noise level was okay. Heard my neighbor talking| unsure if that was them standing outside the door or if it was through the wall. My room door needed to be pulled shut each time when leaving the room. Elevator was okay. Fast| enough room for 6 without touching each other| but the light for level 15 didn't light up in one of them. So sometimes I was unsure if it was selected or not. The location was good. Cheap and expensive food left and right. Time square and 5th ave were only a walk away.,Aug 1| 2021,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
The hotel was in a great location| just off of Broadway and south of Central Park.  Rooms were small but comfortable| nice bathroom.  Like similar NY hotels| there were three small elevators for a very tall bldg; almost always the first elevator that stopped was already completely full. Also we checked out an wanted to check some bags to do some things before an early evening flight| was told that only two (for our party of three) would be free| there woukld be $5 charge for the other three; never had that happen before.  Pretty nice workout room.,Jul 31| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
There was always a 10-20 minute wait for the elevator. I had to ask repeatedly (more than 3 times) for someone to come to bring towels| sheets and pick up the garbage. After asking multiple times they picked up the garbage n brought towels once. My sheets were never changed as requested.,Jul 31| 2021,1,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

They gave us bad service. All carpets is dirty| there is no housekeeping service. All is self service. In short. Never make another reservation again in this Hotel.,Jul 29| 2021,1,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
The staff was not nice| not friendly at all| neither helpful. I asked for clean towels| I called 3 times when to the desk twice| until 8pm| they sent the towels. I did not know| they clean the rooms every 5 days| so peple left the garbage outside and maybe they will pick it up one a day or until next day. They have 3 elevators 1 didnt work| you had to wait a long time. The time to check in is at 3pm| we got to NYC at 9 am| and went to the hotel| they said the room will be ready before 3| iy was until 5:40| that they gave us the rooms. The excuse was alwaus the same. They had too much people. Not a nice experience.,Jul 28| 2021,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
I like the fact that it has self service laundry inside the property. The floor in the room has dirty spots. One of the elevators is out of order. It took sometimes 10 minutes wait before we could get in. You have to stay 5 days before someone can clean you rroom. Fridge in the room was temperature warm so it was useless. Our daughter visited once and she was told we were not on the guest list. We have been staying there for 4 days already. Just would not recommend this hotel!,Jul 27| 2021,2,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
Front desk staff was great. Elevators didn’t work and had to wait a long time for one| then packed in like sardines. Many young tourists from Brazil were very hostile| rude and acted uncivilized. Get a lot of rednecks from the Midwest (Michigan| etc.) and the South who visit this hotel. If u can afford to pay an extra $100 per night| better to go to a 5 star hotel then deal with the trashy behavior you will encounter from the guests here.,Jul 27| 2021,1,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
The only positive about this property is the location.  We arrived at 7 pm with advance reservations and 3 pm check-in time and had to wait 25 minutes for a room ‘to be cleaned’ only to be told (after I questioned what was taking so long) we were going to be put in a different room.  There was a problem with the elevators and we waited another half hour to get on an overcrowded elevator to our room.  This was the consistent experience through your three day stay.  The room was average with a decent view.  The second night I requested clean towels and additional blankets (no housekeeping/room cleaning is offered) and it took well over an hour to get them.  This hotel is woefully understaffed.  The second night I requested clean towels and more pillows and it took well over three hours to get them.I paid extra for breakfast only to find out that it consisted of going into a little room to pick three items per guest per day for breakfast.  The breakfast sandwiches looked disgusting and four  out of  five of the other items (juice| yogurt| breakfast bars) we not in stock.  Total rip-off.  We were afraid to eat the few things that were availableThe Empire Steakhouse (adjacent to hotel) was exceptional.  Ardie| our server was amazing.  If only the hotel could replicate the customer service and quality found at Empire  I don’t recommend this hotel.  I feel seriously ripped off.,Jul 27| 2021,2,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

Unfortunately our stay was disappointing. The day we arrived the front desk personnel were more focused on their conversation about there weekend plans then checking in guests. We never received any housekeeping services. The second day we asked for fresh towels and never got them. On the third day we asked for them again and the front desk guy said what do you want me to do about it look around I don’t have them here. I have NEVER had that type of experience with any hotel. When we got into the elevator we ran into the house man and he apologized and said he was the only house man in the building. I blame management for being low staffed and for over booking a hotel that doesn’t have the man power to function.,Jul 17| 2021,1,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

Hilton uses COVID to totally neglect cleaning the room & properly. When booking reservations| website stated room cleaning “upon request” but at check-in| we were told the cleaning is done every 3 days| on the 3rd night when requested| was told it’s done every 5 days. We stayed 6 nights and there was NO room service once! Had to ask for towels & bedding to change ourselves!! The front desk personnel was indifferent when reporting this issue. We only stayed there for their location. Not recommend!!They CANNOT use COVID as an excuse to provide reasonable services!!!!,Jul 15| 2021,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

The worst hotel ever in my life. Don't even look at the photos as actual rooms are absolutely different. It was extremely filthy| hair all over the bed sheets| carpets with fungus| I don't even want to think about it again. I found two roaches crawling on the wall when I woke up in the middle of the night. Digusting and when I told the hotel reception about this| they took it as if it happens all the time| absolutely no apologies and rude. NEVER EVER going back here again| and do NOT recommend this hotel to anyone. With the same amount of money or just a few dolloars more| you can stay at MUCH better hotel in MUCH better condition around this area. This is a garbage.,Jul 15| 2021,1,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

When we got into the elevator we ran into the house man and he apologized and said he was the only house man in the building. I blame management for being low staffed and for over booking a hotel that doesn’t have the man power to function.,Jul 17| 2021,1,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
It was no cold water in my room. I had to take shower only with hot water!,Jul 15| 2021,2,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
Hilton uses COVID to totally neglect cleaning the room & properly. When booking reservations| website stated room cleaning “upon request” but at check-in| we were told the cleaning is done every 3 days| on the 3rd night when requested| was told it’s done every 5 days. We stayed 6 nights and there was NO room service once! Had to ask for towels & bedding to change ourselves!! The front desk personnel was indifferent when reporting this issue. We only stayed there for their location. Not recommend!!They CANNOT use COVID as an excuse to provide reasonable services!!!!,Jul 15| 2021,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

The worst hotel ever in my life. Don't even look at the photos as actual rooms are absolutely different. It was extremely filthy| hair all over the bed sheets| carpets with fungus| I don't even want to think about it again. I found two roaches crawling on the wall when I woke up in the middle of the night. Digusting and when I told the hotel reception about this| they took it as if it happens all the time| absolutely no apologies and rude. NEVER EVER going back here again| and do NOT recommend this hotel to anyone. With the same amount of money or just a few dolloars more| you can stay at MUCH better hotel in MUCH better condition around this area. This is a garbage.,Jul 15| 2021,1,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

The hotel isn't as clean as the pictures show. They have 3 elevators for over 40 floors and over 400 rooms. You're always waiting for the elevator. Often| their cleaning staff are taking up 2 elevators--they need a service elevator. The service is TERRIBLE. Their front desk staff are rude and willfully not helpful. I stayed 15 nights here and I had my room serviced ONCE| despite my asking every 5 days like they said I could. The ONE time they serviced it| they had lost my request for service so I had to sit outside my room to use the internet for a meeting I had to be in| but couldn't do it in the room because the cleaning staff were in there. Other than the fact that this hotel is in a good location| I would stay elsewhere.,Jun 28| 2021,2,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
The location is wonderful| lots of restaurants| shopping and very close to Time Square. However| for our family of 4| the rooms were small and didn’t have enough storage space for us. Rooms were not cleaned daily (just every 5 days) and it took 3 days to get an extra towel. The hotel is not terrible| but it’s not great either. We won’t stay here again.,Jun 28| 2021,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

The room was clean| beds were comfortable| pillows not too much. Overall the hotel was a good hotel and walking distance from all the main attractions. The only bad thing is was the elevator. Since this hotel is close to everything is a very popular hotel. The hotel only have three elevators| only two were working during my stay. The elevators take forever| and people would just end up using the stairs to go down which is not very fun when you are staying in the 30th floor like me. They really need to do something about it. That is the only reason I would not stay again at this hotel because is not very convenient.,Apr 12| 2021,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

I read some of the problems in the costumers before I choose this hotel and unfortunately| many of them happened to me too. Beside that I will consider be in the hotel in other occasion| hopping after the Covid'19| the services become better. I do really like my room and the location of the hotel| so lets wait to the staff/manager to read our comments and do the best to improve the service.,Apr 8| 2021,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
Staff not ready to help. There is no customer service on front desk| because Staff not prepared to listen| they just don't want to understand the problem and find a solution. Very limited to their procedures without understand how it works.,Apr 6| 2021,2,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
I paid extra for a room with “drinks and snacks” and got a regular room with none of that. Tv cable channels were basic. Just would not recommend it. Not worth the price I paid.,Apr 12| 2021,2,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

The room was clean| beds were comfortable| pillows not too much. Overall the hotel was a good hotel and walking distance from all the main attractions. The only bad thing is was the elevator. Since this hotel is close to everything is a very popular hotel. The hotel only have three elevators| only two were working during my stay. The elevators take forever| and people would just end up using the stairs to go down which is not very fun when you are staying in the 30th floor like me. They really need to do something about it. That is the only reason I would not stay again at this hotel because is not very convenient.,Apr 12| 2021,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

Great location. One of the 3 elevators was out of service the entire week I was there| made for long wait times. I had a room with an adjoining door (didn't request it| just happened) and 2 of the neighbors I ended up with during my stay smoked in their room and it permeated into mine. Would recommend requesting a room without an adjoining door if that bothers you.Housekeeping service| even when requested| is hit or miss and only allowed after the 5th day of your stay. I requested it twice and never got it. Finally had to ask for toilet paper and towels. Overall| just ok.,Mar 30| 2021,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
The staff was very friendly| especially Robert| he was very helpful. Due to pandemic| the breakfast is basically just,Mar 30| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
the hotel overcharge the parking fee|  the hotel charged for the $50.00 per day| but the parking place only charge for $40.00 per day.  The overcharge the customer and did not refund the difference to us.,Mar 30| 2021,2,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
There were only 2 elevators so whenever you wanted to go outside or come back in there was always a line for the elevators. Expect to wait 15 min to get back to you’re room.,Mar 29| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
Great location! Room very clean and pretty spacious for 2 people. Bed was good (pillows were flat). Subway stations all around! The only downfall during this visit were the elevators| only 2/3 were running for the entire building so many times we had to wait to go up/down| but no more than 5-10 minutes. Besides that we had a marvelous stay!!,Mar 29| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
Waiting 20 minutes for an elevator to be freed was a bit of a hassle| check in was okay although there should’ve been another person helping out because of the long line.,Mar 29| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

I stayed 2 nights| arrived Friday evening and left sunday morning. No one showed up to clean the room on Saturday| even to collect the trash| nothing. Sunday by 9am the housekeeper knocked the door.

Called front dest because the mini fridge wasn't working. Was told that it wasn't a fridge| its a "cooler" and I can go down to the restaurant to get ice to put it in and that should keep the "cooler" at a low temp. The room was supposed to have a mini fridge. It was clearly a fridge that was broken. Instead of dealing with the problem| they threw this ridiculous lie at me. Was too tired to deal. Make sure your MINI FRIDGE works!,Mar 21| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

Staff was very nice| but i paid for a city view room and our view was the back of a bunch of buildings. That was the only disappointing part of our stay.,Mar 8| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

Hilton is promoting its "Hilton Clean Stay" rhetoric in a seemingly joint effort to fight against covid-19| so we expected the room to be cleaned properly and 'sealed'. It was 'sealed' when we arrived| but the room was not properly cleaned (at all). There was hair and dust all over| on the beds| the floor| the desk| the phone. We asked for the room to be cleaned| and front desk denied us that| and it took us about 1.5hrs to simply get fresh sheets that we had to change ourselves. It took a while for management to even begin to address our issues (two days later). Not sure if we just got unlucky| but it was totally unacceptable.,Mar 6| 2021,2,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

The shower nozzle was also malfunctioning and I did not have hot water throughout my stay which was frustrating / disappointing.,Mar 5| 2021,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

What can I say| I have an ESA a and I needed to move out a side table to make it a step stool for him and I found dried vomit on the walls behind the bedside table.  There was a small insect in the bathroom when I arrived.  One of the towels was dirty (stained) and one was clean upon arrival.  There were 2 silica packets under the bed| some food on the floor| and a water bottle cap - all of which could have killed me dog had I not checked first.  Hair in the bathroom. Hair in the drain - when I showered I was standing in 2” of water and other guests hair came up.  Getting my car out of the garage took 20 minutes for them to find it.  I stayed there once in the past| the manager is extremely unhelpful but the location of this hotel cannot be beat.  I mean the most perfect location for NYC and very reasonable prices.  It’s just funny bc the cleanliness was SO horrid and they have signs everywhere saying “we are committed to a safe and clean stay” LOL through a worldwide pandemic and still utterly filthy.  I have filed complaints with Hilton.  I know this all sounds hard to believe because how could a HILTON (a generally reputable hotel chain) be so gross?!  I felt the same| so please refer to every single photo I took during my stay lol.

It’s just funny bc the cleanliness was SO horrid and they have signs everywhere saying “we are committed to a safe and clean stay” LOL through a worldwide pandemic and still utterly filthy.  I have filed complaints with Hilton.  I know this all sounds hard to believe because how could a HILTON (a generally reputable hotel chain) be so gross?!  I felt the same| so please refer to every single photo I took during my stay lol.  Still waiting to hear back from the manager regarding my complaints.,Jan 3| 2021,1,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

I booked a room with a terrace but when I got there they told me that the rooms with the terrace were limited and only on the 2nd floors The room that they gave me was on the 24th floor which I didn’t request. I think the room info on Orbitz was wrong because I booked a smoking room with a terrace and a city view. The desk agent told me this was a non smoking property so I was confused. Overall my stay was okay it was in a great location near pretty much everything you would need for a Manhattan stay.

Clean room| cozy bed| great price. Had an issue with the toilet in the room but the manager switched our room promptly and fixed it. Not our favorite ny neighborhood/location but was close to our friends and the park so worked well for this particular trip!,Sep 28| 2020,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

My actual stay was ok. I went solo or my birthday. I celebrated myself with balloons and confetti in my room. The front desk person saw me come in with lots of balloons. No one ever said to me| I will be charged an extra $86 if I didn’t clean those balloons out when I go. I found out the next day when my card was charged 👎 If I had known I would’ve removed them.,Sep 27| 2020,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

We loved this location! We were able to walk nearly everywhere we wanted to visit| averaging 10 miles per day! The hotel was very clean and well-appointed with very friendly and accommodating staff. Our only negative was the inability to turn the heat off in our room to allow cool air to flow. We had maintenance come in and it helped some; however| still a little too warm for us.

The hotel is fine. The rooms are small but clean and the location was decent. But the scent of the cleaning products was so strong in the room it gave me a headache.

The hotel room needed to be updated. Many of the lights did not work properly| the safe was broken and the shower also did not work properly. The bed needed a better duvet cover.,Feb 19| 2020,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
Great location| clean and pretty room.  I had a king bed| large room given it's NYC| 28th floor.  Elevator is slow and the line is long.  Front desk could use another person at check-in.  Coffee downstairs in the morning.  Empire Steakhouse is in house and offers room service with a 20% markuo and $6.50 and delivery fee.  I think that's ridiculous.  I did eat there - unimpressed.,Feb 19| 2020,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

Foremost| the staff is exceptionally nice and accomodating. The double bed hotel room itself is very clean and comfy yet a bit cramped. As most everyone will attest| the elevators are not sufficient for amount of rooms and service staff also must use them to get around so patience needed. Bottom line...really good midtown location. Accessible to so many nyc attractions. We were in town to be out and about enjoying and not spending much time in hotel so could overlook tight space...Reminds me of small nyc apartment I lived in for many years as a young new yorker years ago.

The location is perfect| central but not too close to Time Square.  Lots of great bars and restaurants in the Hells Kitchen area.Lovely touch to have coffee| tea and cookies in reception.Although the cookies had all gone one day. And the coffee in the morning| no milk or stirrers.The staff were very helpful from booking our taxi to the airport| helping with queries or just general hello in the morning.I had booked a room with a street view...it wasn't really.  More of a small street view with a view of many buildings| but it was fine.  The room was a great size| lovely bathroom and huge shower.The only thing which wasn't good in the hotel..the lifts. A nightmare. With 34 floors. Stopping at many| it took so long to go up and down.

Great location to explore nyc| steps from Time square. The rooms are new and exceptionally clean. Staff is very welcoming and helpful at all times.

The staff at Hilton Garden Inn were lovely. Someone greeted me whenever I came in and out| and the room was spacious for Manhattan. This is a great hotel in the middle of everything but far enough away from Times Square to be quiet (at least on the 23rd floor). I couldn't have asked for a better experience.,Jan 31| 2020,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
I had to pay a 'deposit' alongside paying for my stay at check in. At checkout I was reassured that the deposit would be refunded right after. Instead of getting the refund back Hilton deducted the entire amount of the stay another time. So I payed the whole amount twice| and no one at Hilton seems to bother to even answer my message| let alone refund me..,Jan 30| 2020,1,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

Amazing location. The room is very clean and fairly spacious for NYC. We had two queen beds which was key. We were very close to Central Park| Broadway| Times Square| you name it. I’m a Hilton honors member| but because I booked through Expedia we weren’t allowed free bottle of water. But turned out to be not such a big thing as they had the most delicious raspberry water available in the lobby every day. I would absolutely stay here again.,Jan 17| 2020,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
Perfect and central location to the events we were scheduled to attend.  On the last day/night we heard this annoying buzzing sound like a cell phone which wouldn't stop.  Had we stayed an additional night we would have notified the front desk.  The staff was very pleasant and helpful.  Will definitely be returning during future visits to New York.,Jan 17| 2020,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

The Hilton has always been a wonderful hotel experience for me while in New York.  I appreciate the warmth and hospitality shown by every member of the Hilton staff.  Housekeeping is particularly excellent| and I want thank them for being so easy to work with!,Jan 13| 2020,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

Quick checkin and friendly staff. Housekeeping staff was also quite efficient. However| the elevators are quite slow even though there are three of them. During peak hours| the hotel does warn to allow extra wait time| it can take up to 15 mins or more though to get to use the elevator either directions. Luckily| we were on a lower floor and so we just used the stairs. We suggest that if you can| at checkin| ask for a lower floor (4 and below)| this way| you have a choice to use the stairs if and when you can.,Jan 13| 2020,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

Over priced and poor service. You have to ask for everything several times and they make no effort to accommodate you. Also what the other reviews are saying about the elevators is true. In 4 days only once did an elevator stop at our floor when we called it to go down. All other times after waiting several minutes we had to take the stairs to go down to the lobby. We could hear the elevators going up and down but they never stopped at our floor.,Jan 4| 2020,2,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

This was my very first time staying at the Hilton Garden Inn/Central Park. I normally stay at the Millennium Hilton in the business district but they were booked. Although the room was nice| the mini refrigerator did not function properly and was not up to code as far as the proper  temperature for a refrigerator| our sink was constantly leaking around the faucet area and my room was very close to the maintenance closet so I would hear constant shutting of the door but at a reasonable time of the morning hours. Also the Elevators were very slow. The best things about this Hilton are having access to a variety of restaurants| your within walking distance to Time Square| Columbus Circle which has an indoor mall and Whole Foods and of course your not too far from Central Park.

I was assigned to the 34th floor| which had a great view and was above most of the street noise.  That was a plus.  On the other hand| if you tried the elevators during a busy time| they would stop at many floors and that slowed things down.  Not much to complain about though.

For the life of me I can't understand why this hotel gets so many positive ratings.  My reservation was screwed up| even though I had paid in advance.  The rooms are tiny| and it is nearly impossible to work with a laptop at the narrow desk.  The bathroom was only so-so clean| and there was abundant hair on the floor.

About what I would expect from a 3 star hotel. I had limited need but in general the staff was nice and friendly. Hotel was a little run down in general but clean and in a good location. I was| however| disappointed with their concierge service| specifically with my transportation to the airport. It was more money than Uber or Lyft but decided to use it as I expected a decent car| as opposed to not knowing with the other services. I was wrong.  The car was clean but small and not better than the other services. The person barely spoke English but managed to tell me 3 times| including showing me on the payments slip| that the tip was not included on the overpriced ride. Won’t use their service ever again. Not a great last impression. Overall the hotel was okay.

Fantastic location| lovely staff. Having a coffee machine and microwave and access to a laundry was great| especially for a longer stay.Didn't like the use of disposable cups etc. Although there was a microwave| there were no implements except cups. No bowls or plates| no cutlery. Had to ask for them and they were single-use disposables.

Met my son in NYC and we had the best time.  The location of the hotel was perfect.  Close to the shows on Broadway| an easy walk to Central Park and to USS Intrepid Museum.

We had a wonderful first time in NYC experience and this hotel was a big part of it. Perfect location as it is close enough to get to everything and just out of the mix enough to be just out of it. A few blocks to times square one way and a couple blocks to Central Park the other way and the subway station is also right there. We found our favorite deli for breakfast or lunch (Premiere Deli) being right near this location and our favorite local bar to watch a game too (Faces and Names). LOVED both of them| repeatedly. The bar and restaurant located inside the hotel was fine| we just opted to have our NYC food experience outside of the hotel. We are already planning on our return visit and would like to stay here again. The staff was outstanding and the room/service was great.,Jun 16| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

The hotel's great| with one exception. The elevator system is horrendous| with frequent unreasonably long waits for an elevator to come. They even have signs up by the elevators on each floor| warning of "long wait times." Can't they just fix it or add more?,May 28| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
The Air Conditioner didn't work even after they said it was fixed 2x & they said they can't refund my money cause I prepaid they Expedia. Then I was told I would get 3|000 points on an Hilton Honors rewards card which I didn't even have cause I don't usually book directly thru the hotel as it's way more expensive but I still haven't gotten those posting points either so I am really upset.,May 28| 2019,1,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

The bathroom door in our room would not shut. It was a sliding door| that constantly slipped open. There was no catch/magnet to prevent it from so doing.We contacted reception| who said an engineer would be up. After half an hour| I went to reception to ask about the engineer. When finally he turned up| he said that they were designed the same way throughout the hotel (something| we later found to be untrue)| and he wasn't sure what he could do. I explained a simple fix| but he said he had to consult someone about it and went away.We never saw him again.In the mean time| we found the "hanging space" in the closet. it was approximately 8" wide| and a 2 FEET DROP.I went back to reception and told him about the both the door and the closet space. Again| I was told that the design was same throughout the hotel| nevertheless I asked to be moved to a different room. I was told this was no problem| but as the hotel was full| we'd have to wait for two days. We could| however| see the room the next morning to ensure that we were happy with it.The next morning we went to reception| only to be told that they knew nothing about it. Fortunately| the concierge was still able to allocate a new room and we moved the following day.The second room was adjacent to the first| but much better. Contrary to what I had been told| there was a hinged door on the bathroom| and reasonable hanging space.,May 26| 2019,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

It was a girl’s trip for my sister’s 50th Birthday. I was a little worried because of reviews of wait times for elevators| which we did not find to be hardly a problem at all.

It was a lucky find|and though we paid a little more because we didn’t book so far ahead| it is an even better value if you do.

This property has (1) overwhelming issue which mutes any other positives. It was not built with sufficient elevator service. There are 30+ floors and only (3) elevators| and as usual at lease (1) elevator breaks down on a regular basis leaving you with just (2) elevator and sometime even (1) at which point you can expect to wait 10-15 minutes for an elevator. On my second day there were no elevators and i had walk down from the 32nd Floor. I strongly recommend not booking this property unless they guarantee you a room on the lower floors.,Apr 14| 2019,1,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
Location awesome.  Rooms could use some updating but otherwise very clean. Staff was excellent.  Our only issue was the elevators.  There are 3 in the small hotel lobby. During our eight day stay maybe two days all three elevators worked.  A few days only one.  Took 10 minutes usually to get on the elevator and people squeezed in so hot and overcrowded.  I’ve have been stuck on an overcrowded elevator and it’s not pleasant so I had major anxiety each time we got on one.  One evening my husband and I walked down 24 flights from our room so as not to be late for a dinner reservation.  Around our fifth day moved to a lower floor so we could use stairs. Not sure why in NY a hotel such as the Hilton cannot have properly working elevators especially after eight days.  Since we spent quite a bit of time on the elevator(s) spoke with staff members.  Said morale was low among employees because of management. They did a most admirable job. We will not stay here again.  I called Hilton while we were there and was told essentially it was not their problem it was the individual property’s problem.,Apr 14| 2019,2,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

The hotel is very nice| front desk staff were great| and the location is perfect. Our stay was only interrupted by very loud service staff that kept yelling and bumping into our walls while cleaning the room next door. The door handles are also very loud when they shut and a guest was given the wrong room number (ours) and tried to get into our room one night. It’s a good New York hotel| but a couple little changes could have made it great.,Mar 12| 2019,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

We stayed here for a family weekend trip.The service was great| everybody we spoke to was very nice. The rooms came with a great view of the city and it's a Hilton so the beds are always extremely comfortable. We were only a few blocks from Times Square| Central Park| and the nearest subway station. Very close to shopping and restaurants.The only bad thing was that the bathroom door did not close all the way which was kind of weird. It was a sliding door and it left about 5 inches to spare; obviously no privacy.Other than that| this was a nice hotel and I would stay again.,Feb 25| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

Room was clean but different things didn't work.  One of the three elevators was blocked more than once| making trips up to our 19th floor room quite slow at times.  We were given expired $15 credits to use with the Curb taxi app.  When we pointed out they were expired we were given more codes for smaller discounts that were also all expired.  It took forever to get hot water in the shower (low water pressure| too) and we never had it in the sink.  When we asked for this and the pressure to be fixed they said they sent someone but it was never altered.  Staff were friendly but again didn't resolve problems.  Coffee machine didn't work and we didn't report it because we were tired of wasting time in line to report things that weren't resolved.  Location is good and room was clean| however too small for a two double bed room - there wasn't enough floor space for two suitcases.,Feb 13| 2019,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

It’s a nice room and we got upgraded to a kind bed| but the shower door didn’t close. It seemed the door was too big and wasn’t constructed properly. Also the elevator took over 15 minutes. On our last morning| there was an extremely loud steam-like whistle coming from the walls. Someone came very promptly to check it out though| which I appreciated. Overall 3.5/5,Feb 5| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

We had to move rooms 3 times due to noise. The first was because we had an ajoining room and our neighbors were up all night. They moved us to a "quieter room" only to be woken uo by a construction worker on the other side of our walling drilling and hammering in the early morning. We moved once more and ended up in another ajoining room which was just as loud as the first. Staff (except for one loveky girl) are apathetic. Ammenities are minimal. Restaurant is sub par. Would not recommended. Theres much better in NYC for a similar price.,Feb 3| 2019,1,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

Our room was SO QUIET. I got much needed sleep. Wasn't real crazy about the sliding bathroom door that didn't really provide much privacy| but| hey| we dealt with it. The pillows were luxurious! TV was great. Bed was big & comfy. Staff was super helpful. Loved the restaurants that were close buy. Applejacks| Angelos and the little 99 cent pizza place were the ones we went to. Appreciated the storing of our bags both before check-in and after check-out so we could roam the streets unencumbered. We'll tell our friends. Great stay!,Dec 9| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

Good location for easy access to the subway| from either 50th Street or 7th Avenue.Room cleaning is good when its done| the daily record keeping of which rooms have been done seemed a bit haphazard on our visit.A bit more maintenance of the rooms wouldn't have gone amiss| both the bedside lights had loose fittings and the microwave oven (nice inclusion) had a rubber foot missing so wobbled quite a bit! In-house restaurant expensive though plenty of others nearby.,Dec 3| 2018,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

First of all| the customer service and friendliness of the front desk staff| house keepers| concierges and bellman is phenomenal!  Nice folks and so helpful!  The room was clean and nice.  Do request a high floor; we had the 7th and sleeping was quite difficult due to street noise...all night.  Our main gripe...the elevator situation!  It is AWFUL.  They have 3 elevators for the 30 some floors but it is impossible to catch one quickly| coming or going.  It took us 25 minutes this morning to get from the 7th floor to the lobby.  If we did not have a stroller and luggage (we were headed back to the airport) we wkikd definitely had taken the stairs.  Every other day| the lobby elevators were also so stressful. As soon as one stops| folks come from all corners of the building and bombard the open elevator!  It was very unusual that there was such a lack of etiquette allowed at this property.  The connecting restaurant next door is nice and the food was very tastey but they loudly refused to allow us to take a wine glass with their wine to our room bc they claim Hilton’s guests “steal” them. Lol.  Interesting choice of words.   Maybe the hotel should invest in inexpensive glasses for the guests?  No sure how to solve that.Overall| nice stay but would not stay again because of the elevator fiasco each day.,Nov 25| 2018,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

Our room was SO QUIET. I got much needed sleep. Wasn't real crazy about the sliding bathroom door that didn't really provide much privacy| but| hey| we dealt with it. The pillows were luxurious! TV was great. Bed was big & comfy. Staff was super helpful. Loved the restaurants that were close buy. Applejacks| Angelos and the little 99 cent pizza place were the ones we went to. Appreciated the storing of our bags both before check-in and after check-out so we could roam the streets unencumbered. We'll tell our friends. Great stay!,Dec 9| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
Room was incredibly small. Had to move the chair out of the room so we could walk,Dec 4| 2018,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019
Good location for easy access to the subway| from either 50th Street or 7th Avenue.Room cleaning is good when its done| the daily record keeping of which rooms have been done seemed a bit haphazard on our visit.A bit more maintenance of the rooms wouldn't have gone amiss| both the bedside lights had loose fittings and the microwave oven (nice inclusion) had a rubber foot missing so wobbled quite a bit! In-house restaurant expensive though plenty of others nearby.,Dec 3| 2018,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

The hotel is nice and the staff is pleasant but I just don't get the bathroom doors| thus the low rating in "comfort." If u surveyed most people| especially women| u would find most people like privacy in the bathroom| not afforded by the "barn door" bathroom closures in place now. Also| I reported a blown bathroom light about 7:00pm and that fell on deaf ears. I had to re-report it when I came back from our night out and it didn't get fixed until midnight. The repair man was very professional and accommodating; he just never received a repair ticket. And ur parking in completely outrageous!

Acabamos de tener una experiencia lamentable en este hotel Hilton. Si bien| sabemos que en Nueva York las habitaciones son muy pequeñas y que era un establecimiento de 3 estrellas| nos fijamos mucho en los comentarios y tuvimos una sorpresa total. Lo que más me impactó es que no limpien las habitaciones con la excusa de la pandemia. Esta información debían darla antes de reservar. Me pareció inconcebible estar en un hotel en el que limpien cada 5 noches y que| como gran cosa| nos dieran toallas de repuesto.Las personas| en general| fueron amables pero esto nos pareció increíble.

Me encanto la localizacion| estaba a tres bloques de Times Square y de Central Park.  Hay muchos restaurantes alrededor muy convenientes.   Aunque el cuarto es un poco pequeño no nos molesto porque basicamente uno va a dormir.  El baño estaba muy comodo y limpio.  Hubo dos cosas que no nos gustaron| no limpian el cuarto todos los dias a menos que se solicite y cuando fui a solicitar la limpieza me dijeron que solo lo hacen cada 5 dias de haber estado en la habitacion ademas el servicio de los elevadores es un poco complicado en horas picos y asi lo indican en unos avisos en el elevador.   Una noche tuvimos que bajar 18 pisos porque el elevador no llegaba o cuando llegaba estaba lleno y teniamos un compromiso.

Very good location (done with the pros). Due the pandemic the cleaning service is done once every 5 days (that is was we were told)| but for our stay of 6 days the room was never cleaned| we even ask for the service and no luck. We also asked for new bedding as the one we got smelled funny| and that took us 3 calls to the lobby. We got new towels becuase we ask for them to the cleaning crew we meet at the corridor (nice people| very apologetic of the situation). We added 100 USD to our reservation so it can include breakfast| big error... The "breakfast" consists on rock frozen mini sandwiches that only get thawed by 5 mins in  the room's microwave| fruit bars and juice. I know that is our fault but the room we reserved was about 120 sq feet with 2 full beds so as you can imagine it was impossible to even walk without bumping with the furniture| 2 people trying to move in the room at the same time it cant be done.,Jul 14| 2021,2,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

Estive neste ontem em 2014 e retornei agora em 2019. Percebi uma piora no atendimento e qualidade de serviços. Chegamos pela manhã e do aeroporto fomos ao hotel. Estavamos com criança pequena. Informaram que o check-in seria as 15h e gentilmente guardaram as malas. No horário retornamos ao hotel já cansados da viagem noturna e não conseguimos fazer check-in pois o sistema estava fora do ar. Ainda tivemos que aguardar quase 2 horas. Lobby lotado| sem conforto. Elevadores sempre muito demorados. Entrega de pacotes muito falha.  O quarto continua confortável e a locaização excelente.

Me gusto la ubicacion y el estado de las instalaciones| no me gusto que todos los dias tenia que hablar para pedir toallas porque solo dejaban 2 cuando eramos 2 adultos y dos menores en la habitacion. Tampoco me parecio bueno el trato del personal del Frontdesk a mi llegada y cuando me acercaba a pedir alguna información. El personal de Concierge muy atento y amable al igual que los botones.,Sep 5| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

Encontrar um hotel com um bom custo beneficio não é tarefa fácil em NY| pesquisei e comparei por muitos dias hoteis em NY e este Hilton foi a melhor opção. Hotel em NY não é barato!! geralmente pequenos!! Este Hilton oferece por umvalor inferior o que outros cobram bem mais caro e na minha opinião| comparando os quartos este é bem melhor!! A cama é Queen Size.. Ótima| o Banherio é bom. O quarto oferececofre| Geladeira| Cafeteira e Microondas(este 4 itens são raros em hoteis de NY). O Quarto não é tão grande| mas está na média dos hoteis em NY. Um diferencial é que não cobram a Taxa de Resort que podeser uma surpresa no momento do checkin!! Quarto tinha ótimas toalhas e a limpeza do quarto muito boa.A localização é perfeita| de 5 a 10 minutos de caminhada do Central park e Times Square| a meia quadra da Broadway| tem 3 estações de metro a 5 minutos| a chegada do JFK é direto pela linha E(azul) e fica a 2 quadras do hotel|a meia quadra tem uma padaria com supermercado com tudo que precisa.,May 10| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

Hotellet har ett mycket bra läge. Rummen var bra ljudisolerade. Ett stort minus var att det rum som jag bokade för fyra vuxna personer skulle ha två dubbelsängar enligt information på hotel.com. I praktiken var det två sängar som var 130 cm breda. Det fanns ingen förståelse för att detta var ett problem och ingen vilja att lösa det eller kompensera för det. De tyckte att det var hotel.com som bar ansvar för denna miss. I övrigt var det ett bra hotell.,Apr 21| 2019,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West,237 West 54th Street| New York| NY| 10019

Läget på detta hotell är utmärkt om man vill bo vi turistkvarteren vid Broadway och Times Square. Vi valde att betala extra för ett rum med city view vilket vi inte ångrade.
