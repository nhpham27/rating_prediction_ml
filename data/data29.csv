Comfortable hotel.,Aug 17| 2021,4,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
I was pleasantly surprised at our short stay at LondonHouse. The staff were very pleasant.  You can reach them by text any time.  The location is great for outings on the Riverwalk and still a short walk to Michigan Avenue. The rooftop bar/dining had a gorgeous view of the Riverwalk and downtown and tasty drinks and tapas. The beds were comfortable and I really like the interior design approach of the interiors and rooms.,Aug 17| 2021,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
Great stay! Rooftop bar provides great views of the city!,Aug 17| 2021,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
Great hotel| wonderful views and centrally located.,Aug 17| 2021,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
Amazing hotel! Service was excellent| great location and beautiful rooftop bar.Will definitely stay here again when we come back to Chicago!!,Aug 16| 2021,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
It was really nice experience. Esepecially the location of the hotel was perfect. I highly recommend this one to tourist and I will stay again later.,Aug 16| 2021,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
Really nice hotel,Aug 16| 2021,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
The location is great and the staff service is excellent,Aug 16| 2021,4,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
The room lacked basics like tea bags.  I was not asked at check to have the room cleaned.  Except for Mark| the bell hop captain| service was not exemplary,Aug 15| 2021,1,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
The staff was very nice and attentive to our needs. We enjoyed the rooftop bar and our room was very comfortable with nice amenities. We will certainly stay at the London House  again. It’s a very good value.,Aug 15| 2021,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
I liked the hotel room’s cleanness and everything was nearly perfect. i stayed at room with river view| it was just amazing. i do not know other rooms will be perfect like one that I stayed for three nights but overall it was the most wonderful nights at hotel in my life.,Aug 14| 2021,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
The manager of the rooftop bar was terrible. Originally said bar doesn’t close till 11:15| finished very expensive dinner downstairs and came up for a nightcap and told bar was closed due to the rain pouring outside. Went down to our room and looked outside and no rain. He should have to go to customer service school!,Aug 14| 2021,3,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
Former Chicago local — stayed here for a weekend and loved everything about it. Beautifully designed and very well kept. The hotel’s location is perfect| right on the Chicago river and Michigan Ave| tons of food options and a super easy walk to all the popular attractions like the bean| Navy Pier| the art museum| river walk| etc. We loved the rooftop bar| great place to grab drinks and enjoy the excellent views of the river and most iconic buildings in the skyline (check out the pic I attached). The restaurant on 21 was great too| food was delicious| but the restaurant is inside and not many tables have views. Room was pristine — looked like it had just been renovated| very clean and contemporary. Love the modern industrial feel. Will likely stay here again when I’m back in town.,Aug 13| 2021,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

Stayed here for amenities that were not available . Was handed a paper that said rooftop is only accessible with reservation( booked until September). Spa is only open for massages ( was planning to do pedicure and waxing). We would not have booked if we were told about this upfront.,Aug 11| 2021,3,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
My husband and i had a very unusual and terrible experience at Londonhouse Chicago Hotel late at night around 12:15am. We got back to hotel and went to the lobby to grab 4bottles of water as everything around us were closed and we ran out of water. The guy name "RICARDO" at the front desk just refused to give us water bottles. He said he can only give us two because that’s the “so-called” rule of Hilton!! He kept arguing with us for continuously 10mins and still didn’t give us water bottles. He said he will charge $5 for each bottles or else we can leave. Yes that came from a Hilton hotel!! Is this how hilton treat their hotel guests?? He was rude as hell and was adamant to not give us 2 freaking water bottles!! I have severe urine infection and needed water badly| i was suffering as i had to take medication. This is just ridiculous and unacceptable from hilton! I stayed at Hilton in other countries too| none of them were this bad. We travel the whole world but this is first time a hotel refused giving water bottles. NOT EVEN OUT OF HUMANITY?! I don’t see any reason of his refusal and aggressive behavior other than we are brown (Bangladeshi) people| and clearly he’s a racist I believe.I wouldn’t have written all these for 2 freaking water bottles if it didn’t get this bad. Just ridiculous!He could have denied us nicely| then we would just buy them. But no! He was very very rude!Other than that| they don’t always receive calls at front desk.,Aug 11| 2021,1,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

Excellent Stay! Nicole at the front desk was excellent. We had previously stayed there in June. Came back for my 55th birthday it was so nice. And I will be back.,Aug 8| 2021,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
The stay itself was really nice| but there were a few things that made the trip a bit unpleasant. My mother and I ordered breakfast the night before to be brought up to our room| but even after the scheduled time| the food was nowhere to be found. There was also a problem with the wifi not working constantly. The room itself was clean and a wonderful place to come back to after a long day in the city. One other thing to mention is that there should have been more hooks in the bathroom for towels| robes| and washcloths.,Aug 8| 2021,4,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
This property was amazing the staff is great the convenience of restaurants being nearby is wonderful I would recommend this place and I surely would love to come visit again soon,Aug 8| 2021,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

Great location - in a beautiful historic building with modern amenities.  It's right in the city| though| so you can hear some street noise in the room at night - including sirens,Aug 7| 2021,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
We were very happy with the location.It would be nice if there were some drawers to unpack our clothing.,Aug 6| 2021,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
Phenomenal views and location.  Walking distance to lots of amazing restaurants | bars and shopping.All staff very friendly and courteous.  Super clean rooms and common areas.  Great amenities in the room.  No complaints…they thought of everything a guest needs.,Aug 6| 2021,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
Full of people| very crowded. Took forever to take the evelator,Aug 6| 2021,4,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
Staff did not try to accommodate us when our flight wasn’t leaving till late afternoon refused to allow us an extra couple hours in room…. When we went to the the lobby so many concert goers using their facilities and restrooms?? I paid over 200 dollars a night and can’t stay another two hours but kids can come all through the hotel to use bathrooms and take pics on stairway??!,Aug 6| 2021,4,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
It's a great location| nice price| and well-staffed and maintained.  The staff was always friendly.  My one complaint is that the elevator system is not good for the pandemic environment.  The floor selection buttons are on the floors by the elevators| not in the elevators. This creates pressure to get into the elevator the system says to even if there are 3 or 4 people already in it.  You can spend a lot of time redoing the process to avoid getting into a crowded elevator| or you can just get in.,Aug 6| 2021,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

I would never stay here again.  For the money you pay| the service is terrible.  There is apparently a rooftop bar| but you cannot get anywhere near it because it's always full of non-hotel guests.  They make no accomodation for hotel guests to have acess.  When you walk into the building| you have to navigate around a sea of valet who don't actually do anything besides huddle in a group and complain about their employment.  God forbid you ask them to help with anything. To top it off| upon checking out| they have refused to give me a receipt.  They charged by credit card| sure.  But to find out what the charges are| they say I need to contact Expedia| wait on hold for hours| for Expedia to get a copy of my receipt.

The room smelled like chlorine and was a little off putting when walking in The room smelled like weed at night from another guest on the floor or next door Parking is convenient but the texting valet feature did not work so we waited for our car for 20 minutes which delayed our dinner reservationThe contactless check in with Hilton did not have clear instructions and we did not receive a Hilton confirmation code so we couldn’t use the contactless check in option.,Jul 19| 2021,3,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

Was excited to book the hotel for the first time and have lunch on the rooftop.   Very cool/unique hotel| great being across the street from the Riverwalk.   The lunch was a bummer -- waitress forgot to put our order in until 45 minutes later and was completely unapologetic about it.  Disappointing.,Jul 12| 2021,4,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

The door next to ours made so much noise that we couldn’t sleep all night. We were so tired and still couldn’t sleep. When you’re staying in nice hotel you don’t expect such treatment. But we were so disappointed and so tired. I would not recommend this place to anyone and I will not stay there again.,Jul 10| 2021,2,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

First the bad: Check in agent straight up said this is an Expedia booking| we don’t look at requests (in this case no goose down bedding).  Pre assigned low floor no view for a 5 day stay.  Hotel has highly rated rooftop bar yet guests unable to make reservations and have to wait in a ginarmous line with general Public.The good:  great physical building and location in heart of magnificent mile with easy access and lots of walking distance amenities Bottom line : rating could easily ratchet to excellent with training for staff and making amenities inside hotel available first to guests,Jul 7| 2021,3,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

The staff was nice at first until my wife got locked out of the room. They refused to let her in although she was with me during check in and could verify all my info. She stood outside the room for 1.5 hrs as i called nd spoke with 3 seperate people who all claimed to be the manager. Upon my arrival back to the hotel they told her all she had to do was verify the phone number on file to be let in. The guy was beyond rude and spoke to her as if she couldnt understand what he was saying. The experience was very unnecessary.  Then i spoke to another manager Matthew who blamed the experience on housekeeping saying sometimes they come up to the front. Then i gave theans name "Arturo". He says "Oh i know who he is. Im sorry for the confusion so what i will do is remove the charge from the rooftop bar that is on your room". I replied what charge because I paid with my card. *showed him the statement that shows my card was charged. His replied "Well for your troubles I will take it off the room". I again advised there shouldnt be a charge on my room because it was already taken off my card as i just showed you with the exact same amount. He then says well ill remove it off the room and told me to have a great day. Nothing was solved and he basically brushed me off. Then today another 2 charges hit my cards nd another manager Grace told me to wait a few days and call back.,Jun 28| 2021,3,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

The hotel was great and the location was excellent! For the price| you cannot beat it.. My only complaint is that house-keeping never entered our room during the 4 nights we stayed there. The bed was never made and the towels were never replaced.,Jun 2| 2021,4,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

The pictures are far from what the room really is. They advertised the room as luxury but is not. Other than that| the hotel is average. Good location.,May 26| 2021,3,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
A little disappointed because it is not fair that being staying at the hotel they do not let you go up to the roof top. I just wanted to go and see and the person who attended that day told us that if we did not have a reservation we could not go up. That part  It is not fair because one is staying at the hotel and it is not fair,May 25| 2021,3,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
Fabulous hotel with a great location. The hotel was about a quarter mile from the State/Lake transit stop| so it is super easy to get to. (The orange line from there takes you directly to the midway airport.) On one side| the hotel overlooks the river (we paid extra for the view| but it was worth it). The hotel is near a major thoroughfare| so you can hear some traffic noise like honking even on the higher floors. The hotel was very clean| and customer service was excellent. The hotel has three restaurants| a hotel bar and a cafe all in the same building| so food was always nearby. If you want to visit the rooftop bar| you must make a reservation| so we recommend booking your reservation in advance. Unfortunately| the timeslots were all booked while we were there. Free water is not provided (there are 2 Voss bottles for $5 each in your room)| so we recommend bringing some with you. We also ate at Ocean Prime in the hotel and it was AMAZING.,May 25| 2021,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

Original room AC was broken. The front desk said someone would be right up. After an hour and 2 more phone calls they brought us keys to a new room that ended up being much nicer than the room we had. Not sure why it took so long to just give us another room or that option. Felt lied to a little since they originally said someone was on the way. Real story was someone would be on the way After they went to 3 other rooms and fixed issues there. There is a club on the roof and that makes the lobby very crowded every night. Not a huge problem but people should be prepared. Check in is actually on the second floor and there is no signage or anything letting you know. You just have to figure that out on your own. It has the worst elevator system I ever saw. Be prepared to wait 10 minutes any time you need the elevator. Room was great.

Great location. Beautiful hotel. Clean. Great staff. If you want to go to Rooftop to eat outside MAKE A RESERVATION prior to the day you want to go. This was not explained to us. You cannot make a same day reservation. Concierge will tell you you have preference to get seated that is not entirely true| they dont even do the bookings. You will wait for ALL reservations to be seated before they will take you up.

The whole reason for staying here was because it had a rooftop bar/patio. It wasn’t open the first 2 days of our trip. We were on our way to a sightseeing tour and decided to go up and take a look on our way out. We were told we couldn’t and had to have a reservation... just to see it. Of course all reservations were taken. We stayed 4 days... sheets were never changed. The car was parked outside of our room for hours so we assumed they would clean our room as well. When e we returned at 2pm it wasn’t done so we called the front desk. We were told we should have called before 12. The front desk and restaurant staff were rude both times. There is also no microwave or vending machines anywhere in the building. I definitely wouldn’t recommend staying here.,May 3| 2021,3,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
This property's location is awesome| the view from the rooftop is amazing.

The overall stay was wonderful. Upon arrival the valet were prompt to ask if you are checking-in. The staff were very courteous and helpful. They made me aware of the Covid guidelines and which services were not available. During my stay I noticed everyone was abiding by social distancing and mask wearing.

The bed| view| and mini fridge were great.  I was able to check in early and I appreciated that.  The coffee maker wasn't cleaned out properly| the toilet paper holder was broke| super low water pressure in shower| and one of the bellman stopped trying to get me a cab. (The other bellman took note and took over| super kind!  Mark is name).  I also ordered dessert for myself and niece from the restaurant connected to the hotel (Ocean?).  Horrible.  Old carrot cake and ice cream (both so grainy....$40 wasted.)

Was a little disappointed by the room but the people and service was great. The bed was hard| however the bedding was nice. There was no closet space or anywhere to put your things. Also it was a lot smaller than we had imagined| the “sitting room” was tiny and that was why we chose the room| for some separate space.,Dec 23| 2020,3,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

The location is nice. Rather than that disappointed for the rest| including:- front desk from the first day check in. I paid with high price to stays in this hotel for 4 days and 3 nights. The receptionist treated me like i came in to ask for free shelter or donations. I asked to have a room with bathtub but how come my booking room does not have one. He said this entirely hotel does not have room with bathtub. And my room is the only one available now. So either i take it or just leave. When my room i already prepaid the whole stays. Thanks a lot for the receptionist guy| totally unprofessional and rudeness. - room service| i had to sleep in the same linen| blanket and pillow cases for the second night even though the room service already done the room cleaning| they did not change my linen| blanket and pillow cases and just put it back in place with dirtiness and wrinkles from the night before. Vacuum in room had not done right with all dirties around the coffee table. The third day| after cleaning the bathroom| they left my toilet rolls on the floor| next to the toilet seat. I stayed there from sunday to weds. Tototally disappointed. Thank you so much for this hotel service. My first time staying| my last time as well. Totally appreciate you guys for one of a kind of service| for an expensive stays| and for the unprofessional rudeness treatment toward customer.

The Hotel was amazing| Loved our room it was cozy and very clean. The staff was friendly and courteous. The only issue was as a guest in the hotel you have to wait to get into the restaurant. The staff gave different stories about having or not needing a reservation to get into the restaurant. Paying guest should be first priority with or without a reservation. We waited more than 2 hours in a line to get in to eat. While outsiders went right up to dine. Not cool and very disrespectful to the paying guest of the hotel.

The Hotel was amazing| Loved our room it was cozy and very clean. The staff was friendly and courteous. The only issue was as a guest in the hotel you have to wait to get into the restaurant. The staff gave different stories about having or not needing a reservation to get into the restaurant. Paying guest should be first priority with or without a reservation. We waited more than 2 hours in a line to get in to eat. While outsiders went right up to dine. Not cool and very disrespectful to the paying guest of the hotel. Other than having to leave the property to get food this hotel is AMAZING!!!,Nov 14| 2020,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

While we knew we booked one of the cheaper rooms it was still slightly disappointing to have a view in the crevice of the building. No room service was another bummer although we’re sure covid is to blame. Entrances to hotel and restaurants were a little confusing| better signage could help. Also disappointed that there was no benefit to accessing the rooftop for guests. Overall our needs were met though and the location was great!,Oct 13| 2020,3,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
A vibrant hotel even during a Pandemic!  Room was perfect and had amazing views. Location could not be better.  We had a misunderstanding with the cleaning of our room but the staff went the extra mile to solve it.  The only thing we missed was visiting the rooftop| there were always huge lines to go up| and finally on our last day that we were able to get a table| we could not go outside because they started construction.  We would definitely be back soon !,Oct 13| 2020,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

Our stay at The London House was amazing| I loved the feel of the hotel. Very luxurious| clean| great location and an amazing rooftop. Overall everything was great| expect for some bugs that we had in our room. I don’t like bugs| and we did have some mosquitos in the room| I had to kill a spider because my husband hates spiders and as well as some other bugs in the bathroom. We did report it to the front desk| they offered to change rooms but we had already unpacked so we suggested if they could spray for at least the mosquitos but not sure if they actually did since we did keep seeing them here an there. We had an amazing view of the river| shopping| bars/restaurants| Millennium Park and many others places were just a few minutes away.

I had the best stay at LondonHouse. My experience went so well that my initial 3 day stay turned into a 16 day stay. Anthony & Ken at the front desk were always so helpful and professional. I can honestly say the staff was one of the reasons I continued to extend my stay. Everyone was so nice and welcoming. The room and view was exceptional. As I worked everyday at the perfectly located desk| I would look out at the Chicago River and I just felt so inspired. I loved how each room was sealed with a sticker so you knew your room was cleaned when checking in. The extra measures the hotel took to ensure safety during Covid was greatly appreciated including the signs indicating how many people are allowed in a elevator| the food delivery safety measures| and masks requirements when leaving your room. The location was perfect and I could walk everywhere and I did. The rooftop restaurant was absolutely beautiful and I had no problem getting a table even when it was super busy. For those times when I had nonstop meetings| the ability to quickly run up there and place a order to bring back to my room made life so easy for me. The Truffle Fries were delicious and I will surely miss those.  I can’t say enough about the beautiful accommodations| the perfect location| and most of all the wonderful staff at LondonHouse. Thank you for everything. I’ll definitely be back! ~Ericka,Sep 21| 2020,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

I had the best stay at LondonHouse. My experience went so well that my initial 3 day stay turned into a 16 day stay. Anthony & Ken at the front desk were always so helpful and professional. I can honestly say the staff was one of the reasons I continued to extend my stay. Everyone was so nice and welcoming. The room and view was exceptional.

Enjoyed my overnight stay. Beds were very comfortable. The view of the Chicago River was really nice. The staff that we came in contact with were all very attentive and helpful. The ice maker on our floor was out so had to travel to another floor to simply get ice.  The room and bathroom were very clean. I used cavid wipes to clean the room once we arrived and to be honest it was not necessary. I wiped the tv stand| chairs| bed post even the window seal and no dirt or dust. Bathroom was spotless. Cudos to the Housekeeping Staff!!!!  The only downside was being a guest of this hotel and not be able to go to the rooftop bar without a reservation and of course they were completely booked.,Aug 20| 2020,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

August 2020 - Overall the stay was good| clean room. Only issues: Due to covid - no coffee machine or complimentary water bottles| no dine in service. Nothing amazing but not bad either.I had informed the hotel that it was my wedding night but they couldn't do anything to make the stay special| not sure if this was due to covid or because they just didn't care enough to go out of their way.,Aug 4| 2020,4,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
Rooms are very small| and I’m positive that restaurant employee bus boy stole my iPhone 11 Pro Max and AirPods Pro. No cameras in restaurants to prove it.

Everything about the visit was perfect.  We arrived a few hours early and they offered to send us a text when our room was ready.  They put us in a beautiful 9th floor room with a perfect view of the river.

I might visit. For drinks or the view I was supposed to pay 191 including tax when I called to check on my room. And what rates I was getting. I get. The taxes but. 349. Still came off my card the rooms were not together. I had to change roomA because one room wasn’t Ready and had cigar smoke all in it. Then prior to getting in our room. It was hard reaching them. One of the Hispanic staff members just walks in room when ppl are undressing. I wasn’t very pleased about that. The food on the top floor when we got ours was cold.

Great location! Beautiful building and well-kept. Issues with the service team not going the extra mile to accommodate me when I had questions about their Rooftop seating. Reservations for the Rooftop are booked months in advance which suck for guests. Luckily| as a guest of the hotel you can stand in a separate line and wait for a table to become available. I feel staff could have expressed this more clearly. I paid A Lot of money to stay there for this particular feature| The Rooftop. Also had an issue one evening where someone in an another room was smoking weed. Kept us up at night. The room| hotel and the view was spectacular which is why I did not make such a big deal out of those stated inconveniences.

The staff and hotel we're on point during this pandemic with cleaning|making sure everyone wore a mask and social distancing down to the elevators. Hallway and rooms are super clean and bed is so comfortable.,Jul 20| 2020,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

This hotel has a very nice| welcoming reception area with friendly staff| all of whom were wearing masks. The space was cleaned and there were sanitizing stations everywhere as well as plexiglass barriers at the front desk. Covid safety was good.The room was beautiful and incredibly clean and tidy| very well-decorated and stylish. The beds were super comfortable and fresh and the bathroom was quite spacious and also very clean with good quality cosmetics and comfy bathrobes. Very nice shower too. Right in the middle of the city with a great breakfast option in the building.,Jul 18| 2020,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

Room smelled like smoke. Staff kept knocking even with do not disturb sign posted. Awful experience.,Jul 13| 2020,1,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
The hotel is nice and in a good location but we could not sleep most of the night. The ice maker was super loud! I got maybe 3 hours of sleep. Also| if you want to go to the Rooftop restaurant call in advance| at least 1 week in advance. We were not able to get there because we did not make reservations in advance. There is Trump hotel across the street. It is free to take an elevator to the 16th floor where the restaurant/bar with the view is located. We went there to take a picture. Walking outside by the hotel last night was anther terrible experience. Lots of homeless people literally walking after you begging for food| and lots of overdosed people.,Jul 13| 2020,1,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

Beautiful property and my riverfront room had a stunning and amazing view. Other than that| I was extremely disappointed in the customer service of the hotel| it felt a little run over by a younger crowd| the first floor of the hotel was always crowded with a line for folks looking to enjoy the rooftop - so there’s a club line in the hotel? Am I in Las Vegas?  And finally| the wi-fi was problematic for my entire stay.

Terrible customer service. I requested for housekeeping as instructed and never happened. Also| the rooftop lounge doesn’t give current hotel guest preference over walk-ins.

The room was extremely clean and comfortable. The view was incredible.But the noise from the street was terrible through the whole stay -- worse than staying right on Freemont Street in Vegas. Highly advise bringing 3M Classic earplugs (no affiliation| they just block noise well) because the little foam peanuts won't block out the sounds at night.I couldn't get to see or use the infamous patio| unfortunately| I didn't make reservations and guests can't see it without one.But great staff and great location. No issues other that extreme street noise.,Jul 7| 2020,3,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
Our stay was fairly pleasant| but I'm not sure we would necessarily book this hotel (or the king corner suite again). The setup of the room was a bit odd. We didn't love how the bathroom was right next to the bed| with only a sliding glass door in between the spaces. There was no dresser in the room| which made unpacking a little difficult| and we relied on a small under-bed drawer and two nightstand drawers to hold all of our belongings during our stay.The valet seemed overloaded and we were never able to get through when we tried to phone down in advance. It seemed like they had a sizeable staff| but the volume of in and out activity from guests appeared to be more than they could handle.The best part of this hotel? The rooftop bar. But you don't need to stay here in order to enjoy it. Make sure you book your rooftop reservation in advance because it fills up quickly in the warmer months.,Jul 7| 2020,3,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

Hotel staff wasn't the greatest. We weren't greeted as we usually are at check-in. While we were walking off from check-in there was actually someone there complaining about how this was the worst Hilton he has stayed at. We didn't pay it no mind but soon figured out what he was talking about. The hostess at the roof top bar seated us at a DIRTY table and didn't come back to clean it off. The waiter served our drinks| said he would be back to check on us and after 15mins| he never did. We had to leave because we were only able to have our table for 1 hr. The smell of POT was HORRIBLE! If I get drug tested| there might be a problem. It was all we were breathing up and down our hall. To say this was the best experience we've had at a hotel Hilton hotel would be a lie. If we ever go back| it will be to a different hotel.,Jul 6| 2020,2,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

Room itself had cobwebs in a ceiling corner and food debris on the desk.  They advertise that they have a COVID cleaning protocol but we saw no evidence that they followed it.  The fellow outside the hotel refused to put his mask on when we asked him and did not social distance (we're 61 and 66 yo so in a risk group)  Of their 8 elevators only 1 or 2seemed to be actually working at any given time so social distancing was impossible.  They have a few signs reminding guests to wear masks but zero enforcement.  We've been isolated for 14 weeks at home but now| 4 days after leaving I have a temp of 102.5 and am coughing.  I don't know that it is COVID or that I caught it there but if it is| at a minimum| I've shed virus all over the hotel.,Jun 26| 2020,1,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

Great location. Check in staff was nice and upgraded our room to a higher floor. However| during the night loud music from other rooms which was addressed later when we requested. The hallways and elevators smelled of cigarettes/ marijuana. Not sure how strictly the hotel is enforcing their non smoking policy but I strongly suspect that people were smoking in rooms nearby.,Jun 25| 2020,3,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

No vending machine or option for quick drink.No coffee maker in room. Had to purchase from restaurant which took a significant amount of time.The hair dryer was broken. Waited on line for guest services for 13 minutes before my call was answered. I was in a hurry to leave| but could not do so with wet hair. Finally received hair dryer after 20 minutes of waiting.  I was late for a meeting| making me very unhappy. There were other guests loudly fighting at 2:30 am. I had to call front office. Took at least 10-15 minutes before resolved and yelling stopped so I could go back to sleep.Over all nice room. Seemed clean.,May 21| 2020,3,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
Staff was very friendly & helpful & the food next door was great so we didn’t have to leave the hotel the elevators system went out but they helped their guest by manually working the elevators from the inside with there keys which was great for us Because we had a stroller & our room was on the 10th floor ! So thankful for that it was very clean & had amazing set up all through the hotel.,May 20| 2020,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

I’ve stayed at this before and it was great- this time though it was very understaffed. Also the elevator broke and was unusable the day I left. Very disappointing on the 8th floor Also no coffee maker in the room. Had to ask 3 times for one- then no coffee took another 3 times-to get it.

Waited on line for guest services for 13 minutes before my call was answered. I was in a hurry to leave| but could not do so with wet hair. Finally received hair dryer after 20 minutes of waiting.  I was late for a meeting| making me very unhappy. There were other guests loudly fighting at 2:30 am. I had to call front office. Took at least 10-15 minutes before resolved and yelling stopped so I could go back to sleep.Over all nice room. Seemed clean.,May 21| 2020,3,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
Staff was very friendly & helpful & the food next door was great so we didn’t have to leave the hotel the elevators system went out but they helped their guest by manually working the elevators from the inside with there keys which was great for us Because we had a stroller & our room was on the 10th floor ! So thankful for that it was very clean & had amazing set up all through the hotel.,May 20| 2020,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
Hotel receptionist was very helpful. Literally “Everything” was great| during this pandemic. Actually my stay here was the most memorable with my sons| only wish they had their “own” parking. I wish I could have stayed another two days.,May 19| 2020,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

I’ve stayed at this before and it was great- this time though it was very understaffed. Also the elevator broke and was unusable the day I left. Very disappointing on the 8th floor Also no coffee maker in the room. Had to ask 3 times for one- then no coffee took another 3 times-to get it.

The hotel is beautiful and is kept to a high standard. It’s in a prime location and every park of Chicago is walkable. It’s on the doorstep of the river walk and there’s a train station (State/Lake) about a 2 minute walk. The hotel looks and feels plush and the views from the room and especially the rooftop bar are absolutely stunning! The staff are polite and helpful.

The room was extremely up to date. Staff was excellent & pleasant. Building cold n had propane heaters in lobby. I didn’t like the the walls were thin n could hear others & my keys didn’t seem to work next day.,Jan 20| 2020,4,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
Great Location right by the main thoroughfare of Wacker and Michigan Avenue.  The river view is Amazing and it is a great spot for picture taking and just enjoying what Chicago has to offer.,Jan 19| 2020,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
Loved this hotel.  Great location. Directly across from trump building.  Upgrade to river view well worth it. Can see all the bustle of the city and famous buildings| water taxi| all the bridges...  famous Lou malnatis (deep dish pizza) a short walk and worth it (make a reservation).  We stayed on  20th floor which was excellent. Had an additional room on the 6th floor (kids room).  The higher the floor the better the view in my opinion.  Rooms were clean and very comfortable.  Only valet parking avail (around $80 per night) but convenient.   No pool or hot tub.  Rooftop bar and area to view city on 22nd floor was worth viewing at night.  Room stocked w nespresso| small fridge- no microwave.  Robe and slippers provided.  From hotel we walked to magnificent mile (shopping)| Hancock Building| millennium Park (the bean).  Hop on/ hop off stop 1 directly across street from hotel.   Would recommend This hotel for a trip to Chicago (and I’m picky!).   Traveled with husband and 3 kids (14|17|18).,Jan 18| 2020,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

Great stay clean great view walking distance to restaurants 😁,Jan 16| 2020,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
The hotel is beautiful.  The bar upstairs is a great place to take clients for a pre or post dinner drink.  I love the overall style of the rooms and hotel along with the location.  My only complaint would be the automatic lighting in the room.  There were not enough lights in trying to work at night and the auto/ motion light switches were highly annoying in that they would shut off unless there was movement.  I felt like I was working in a dungeon at times.,Jan 16| 2020,4,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
A beautiful| iconic hotel that masterfully blends its historic charm and elegance with modern touches and amenities. Staff was spot-on. Great lobby bar| gym| and the location is primo. The rooftop deck is a must for a drink and the incredible views of the city.,Jan 15| 2020,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

Location is amazing and the rooftop is lovely. Of course better in the summer,Jan 20| 2020,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
The room was extremely up to date. Staff was excellent & pleasant. Building cold n had propane heaters in lobby. I didn’t like the the walls were thin n could hear others & my keys didn’t seem to work next day.,Jan 20| 2020,4,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
Great Location right by the main thoroughfare of Wacker and Michigan Avenue.  The river view is Amazing and it is a great spot for picture taking and just enjoying what Chicago has to offer.,Jan 19| 2020,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
Loved this hotel.  Great location. Directly across from trump building.  Upgrade to river view well worth it. Can see all the bustle of the city and famous buildings| water taxi| all the bridges...  famous Lou malnatis (deep dish pizza) a short walk and worth it (make a reservation).  We stayed on  20th floor which was excellent. Had an additional room on the 6th floor (kids room).  The higher the floor the better the view in my opinion.  Rooms were clean and very comfortable.  Only valet parking avail (around $80 per night) but convenient.   No pool or hot tub.  Rooftop bar and area to view city on 22nd floor was worth viewing at night.  Room stocked w nespresso| small fridge- no microwave.  Robe and slippers provided.  From hotel we walked to magnificent mile (shopping)| Hancock Building| millennium Park (the bean).  Hop on/ hop off stop 1 directly across street from hotel.   Would recommend This hotel for a trip to Chicago (and I’m picky!).

The hotel is beautiful.  The bar upstairs is a great place to take clients for a pre or post dinner drink.  I love the overall style of the rooms and hotel along with the location.  My only complaint would be the automatic lighting in the room.  There were not enough lights in trying to work at night and the auto/ motion light switches were highly annoying in that they would shut off unless there was movement.  I felt like I was working in a dungeon at times.,Jan 16| 2020,4,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
A beautiful| iconic hotel that masterfully blends its historic charm and elegance with modern touches and amenities. Staff was spot-on. Great lobby bar| gym| and the location is primo.

The staff and property was very accommodating. The old and new touches to the property was very well designed. We will be returning and will be staying back at the London house. April and Bess were so funny and answered all of our questions. The staff helped me plan a surprise and really pulled it off. They went above anything expected and really made our stay the best. Thank you to the staff.,Nov 26| 2019,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

Pretty good overall. I did the “upgrade room” for $100 more for the weekend and it wasn’t as spectacular as they made it sound. I was hoping for much more of a view. We received a corner suite and were facing the other half of the building and the river but the building blocked most of our view. Then when we returned the following day after room service had come we saw our champagne glasses we had brought with us in their cart. Had we not seen that they would have been gone for good. I get that’s a simple mix up but i would have been super upset had they taken them. Also when we entered our room after they had come to clean it smelt like sewage and the smell would not go away. We were leaving in the morning so we just dealt with the stench. We ventured up to the rooftop| insanely busy. Service could have been a bit friendlier up there. We asked how to get the to outdoor bar for the views and the guy said up the stairs. Well it’s our first time there and didn’t see any stairs and he directed us over as if we were stupid and showed us where they were. You’re kinda of wandering around in the hotel. No one really told us where to go etc we had to ask or find things ourselves. They also do hold a $100 deposit for each night you stay. That was not listed on the Expedia| I had to call and ask. I loved the robe and slippers. Nice water pressure and heat in showers. There is no lock or regular door for the bathroom. Frosted sliding glass door. And no fan. No privacy.,Nov 18| 2019,4,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

I started out well. Check-in for three (3) nights went very smoothly| room was ready| staff was friendly and inviting. Room was very nice-clean with a beautiful view. It was downhill after that. Discovered quickly that shower was broken (worked but not well at all)| but after a long flight did not want to change rooms and even less have someone else get stuck with the problem (a problem so obvious that there is no excuse that the manager who will respond to this could give me). We left every morning around 10 am to venture around the city| only to come back around 4 - 4:30 pm to find our room had not been cleaned. We called housekeeping and were told they had until 5:30 pm to clean it. After my many many years of travels| I can understand one day running late on cleaning the rooms but every day? Ice machine was not working on my floor. Asked for ice| never got it. Need I go on? Rooftop was nice with a great view| although table were not cleaned. It had rained the previous night and obviously they had not brought the exterior cushions from the rooftop inside. A beautiful sunny day the next day and no one can sit on the couches outside since they are all still soaking wet. Many irritants at this hotel unfortunately. Aside from location| disappointed.,Nov 11| 2019,3,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

The coffee making facilities in the room was useless| luckily there was a nice cafe on the ground floor. The roof top bar while relatively expensive is a must see for view,Oct 25| 2019,4,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

The room was clean and bed was comfortable. It seemed like the room had been recently updated and was nicely appointed. During the night the room was noisy| sounded as though there was a large fan that was starting up and slowing down.  Staff need to be able to answer simple questions| without saying that that isn’t my job. Such as| which way is the State Street  Bridge. We wanted to clear our bill the night before we left to save time in the morning and were told we had to pay another night even though it had been paid|  These are basic things that all staff should know or be able to find the answer.,Oct 24| 2019,3,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

People at front desk were truly rude. At check in he charged my credit card with $100 per day because my reservation was in Expedia. No benefits for HHonors member| because of same reason.At check out the attendant said my $400 refund could take from 3 to 5 working days. Both employees were very far from sympathetic to a client.

Super good location for going everywhere| especially for the purpose of running Marathon.Bed is comfortable and the room is big enough no matter it's located at the heart of Chicago tourist area.Just little comment on the question of whether they provide daily room cleaning as stated on reservation.

When we checked in we offered to pay our bill and they told us know we would pay in the morning when we checked out at 7:15 we had a knock at our door wondering if we were there and then again woken up at 8:30 by another person wondering if we were there when we left at 10:15 in the morning for our brunch and return at 11:15 we were unable to get into our room our key card had been disabled they had to have a manager come up and open a room when we address this with the staff they were apologetic and did take some money off of our bill but because the man the night before would not accept our payment and told us we didn't have to pay till the next day they were afraid that we were going to leave without paying communication is everything,Sep 2| 2019,2,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

We stayed multiple nights in a double bed river view room.  When we arrived| we upgraded to a parking package and a room on a higher floor.  Loved the location of the hotel and the views of the city from our room.  Everything was very clean and our room was quiet at night.  Drawbacks included that the room size was smaller than expected with limited seating options (only 1 chair by the window| should be 2)| room service menu was small and pricey| and the pillows were awful (although the beds were great).  Those small issues aside| my biggest concern was our use of valet.  When we arrived we parked our car in valet and didn't use it the few days we were in the city.  When we got the car back upon leaving| things were out of place.  It was obvious to us that the car had been looked through--items that had been put away in the console (a pair of sunglasses specifically) were on the driver's seat floor of the car.  Paperwork that was in the passenger dash compartment was moved out and crumpled up on the backseat floor (our registration| proof of insurance| etc).  We had taken out all of our valuables| etc before parking it with valet| but it was disheartening to get it back and realize that our things had been gone through.  We travel very frequently to major cities across the United States| and have never had this happen to us before.  Because of the violation of our privacy| we will not be back| when otherwise we probably would have as we visit Chicago multiple times per year.,Aug 20| 2019,3,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

Beautiful room (though I had to change rooms when mine faced the air conditioning vents). Loved the way the lights came on automatically when you went into the bathroom| v useful to not wake your room-mate! Strangest lifts I've ever come across- if you don't put your floor into the touch-pads on the landing you can't imput it in the lift itself| bit awkward! Rooftop bar unusual| great views| BUT crowded| few seats| no area for hotel guests| only if you re paying the ridiculous bottle prices are you allowed a table| no-one told people not to hog the few chairs with bags (I asked politely if a seat was taken and was told very rudely to get lost| staff said nothing.

I’m new to Hilton honors program| . When I checked in I was told that my points won’t be counted because I booked with Expedia and not directly with them| seriously? So the receptionist informed me that I only booked a standard room and that I could upgrade my room for $50/ night. I declined the offer| because I am expecting to have at least a decent room. We were assigned on 6th floor. The room smelled awful| like B.O. and I noted that there was an air freshener attached to AC. I went back to the reception area| and complained  about the room| she said the only room that’s available is on the 7th floor. I told her I won’t be wasting my time going back and forth without having a guaranteed decent room| so I told her I will just pay extra for an upgraded room. She said the only room that’s available for an upgrade is on the  10th floor. I told her if we could have a higher floor| since I am paying extra for this. She said| no room is available on a higher floor at this time. I told her that I am really disappointed with what’s going here. She said if we want to wait until a higher floor is available| I said we’re willing to wait until it’s available| Then she said she’s sorry when she checked her computer again| there’s no more available room on a higher floor. I was really upset|  she said she is just an employee and she does not make the rules. She said she will talk to the manger about the room| and miraculously we got the room on 18th floor,Aug 11| 2019,2,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

Hotel in good condition with very little sign of wear and tear.,Aug 10| 2019,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
The Hotel was very close to shopping| theatre district| food| restaurants and cafe's. And we had a very nice view of all the small bridges and multistoried hotels from the room| the night view was breathtaking. The big bus on and off stop was right across the hotel and so was the Riverview Walk. Interesting thing about the elevators| is that it displays the elevator Car arriving at your floor| so there is no guessing and running at the last min.

Had a great time staying here for a few days last week. Room was very spacious| quiet| clean and the bed was very comfortable. Both check in and check out process was smooth. The highlight of amenity is definitely their rooftop bar| a great view of the city. Their location also excellent| they have most of the river cruise ports at their doorstep by the bridge| and walkable distance to the shopping area| lakefront trail and parks.,Jul 29| 2019,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

The location was excellent The suite was  perfect for ourselves and a pull out couch for our daughter Expect a very busy lobby due to many people waiting to get on elevator for Rooftop Bar/restaurant Only negative is the elevator usage. 6 or 8 elevators but when you put your floor in| most of the time you’re waiting for one elevator and so is everyone else. Very annoying.,Jul 20| 2019,4,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
Gorgeous space and view. Classic building. Excellent service by all. Super walkable location. My *only* complaint has absolutely nothing to do with the hotel| but the bagpiper who stood on the corner across the street... and played for 8 hours straight every late afternoon into evening. You’ll probably be out and about in the city – but I spent a bunch of time in the room needing to work. Wasn’t very loud... just persistant.

Hotel staff were excellent. Hotel location was right near the best shopping and river access. Views from hotel were better then expected. Only negative is when you want to eat or drink on the roof. We waiting 10 minutes on our floor for the elevator. Called the front desk and they said you are better off going to 20th floor and then take the stairs. There was one elevator dedicated for the roof. A simple sign at the elevator would have been ideal stating this fact. Definitely get a reservation for the 22nd floor outside dining.|,Jul 14| 2019,4,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
We were spending the day in Chicago for My Husbands Birthday.  We showed up to London House and waited in line for the Rooftop Bar.  The waiting area was air conditioned and had a small Bar where you could get refreshments while you waited.  The Line moved quickly and once we were at the Rooftop Hostess area we were politely greeted and given an accurate wait time.  I mentioned it was his Birthday to Cedric at the Host Desk.  Cedric went Above & Beyond to make sure that not only we had an Amazing Table with a View but that the Staff knew the special occasion.  Cedric was Amazing as was our Waitress “Q”.  He checked in on us throughout the evening and made sure My Husband had the VIP treatment.  We had such a great time we wound up getting a room with the same Amazing view from the Rooftop. We also had a delicious Brunch with a View the next Morning on the same Rooftop.  All the Staff we encountered at London House were Attentive and Courteous and we will definitely be staying there whenever we are in the City.  A special thank you to Cedric| Q and Caitlin at the front desk for turning our rooftop visit into an Amazing weekend my Husband is still talking about.,Jul 14| 2019,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

Great hotel| very comfortable room| great view| nice bathroom and shower products. A bit of a nuisance waiting for elevators when youre in a rush| plus the elevator never went up to the rooftop for some reason| so i had to climb the stairwell. Wifi in this hotel is horrific though.

London House is in the middle of everything. Our room was on the small side| but it was beautiful. We had the most amazing views of the river and the Wrigley Building. If you're looking for a party| the restaurant/bar on the rooftop had good food and great music - and more amazing views.  The ONLY negative I can think of is that the elevators are really slow| but it's an historic building| so totally understandable.,Jul 6| 2019,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

This hotel is amazing. It was deal of the day on hotels.com so I booked it. When I got there I had to park my car they only have valet and like all other hotels Downtown Chicago it’s expensive. For parking and a city bite upgrade it was $100 more but well worth it. The view of the river was breathtaking.Room was very big and up to date.

I confronted the housekeeper who got very defensive| which I was only suggesting that maybe they got caught in the bed sheets| but he was quite rude and not very helpful. I told the staff at the front desk as I left but had to check out quite quickly for a flight. They told me to call up and explain| which I have done 3 times and been promised call backs to no such luck.

We had a wonderful stay at the LondonHouse! Caitlin was attentive at check-in including her follow-up texts to make sure everything was satisfactory with our room. Dinner was great at LH21 and again| our server was wonderful and attentive! I would highly recommend staying here when in the windy city. I can't wait to stay here next time I'm in town.,Jul 1| 2019,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
This hotel is amazing. It was deal of the day on hotels.com so I booked it. When I got there I had to park my car they only have valet and like all other hotels Downtown Chicago it’s expensive. For parking and a city bite upgrade it was $100 more but well worth it. The view of the river was breathtaking.Room was very big and up to date. The bed was probably the most comfy I’ve slept in. Service was remarkable.Definitely will stay here again and recommend staying here,Jun 30| 2019,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
Great location! Every negatives comments about staffs| delayed elevator did not happen on our stay at all. You can’t expect 5* service at 4* hotel obviously but I think London House doing their best. The location is super convenience| elevator is doing fine| no waiting time at all. I was super skeptical and almost cancel my reservation after reading all the negative comments and I’m glad i didn’t.,Jun 30| 2019,4,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
The view of the river and city skyline was AMAZING! The service was so good too. We loved the Rooftop Bar on the 21st floor. It was in a great location near Grant Park. We were able to walk to Navy Pier in about 23 minutes. Also lots of shops and other great food options near by.,Jun 30| 2019,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

I had a lovely stay at the hotel until just before I checked out. I left my airpods on the side next to m bed (which my colleague even reminded me to pick up as I was grabbing some last minute bits)|I then realised within the few minutes I reached the lobby so ran back to collect them. In that time| my bed had been stripped and they were nowhere to be seen. I confronted the housekeeper who got very defensive| which I was only suggesting that maybe they got caught in the bed sheets| but he was quite rude and not very helpful. I told the staff at the front desk as I left but had to check out quite quickly for a flight. They told me to call up and explain| which I have done 3 times and been promised call backs to no such luck. I travel a lot with work and am a loyal customer to Hilton but I feel in this instant I have been given no assistance and know that those AirPods were there emergency I first left my room. Very unimpressed with the lack of service I’ve had since.,Jun 28| 2019,1,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

After checking in| we entered our room and wanted to order room service but couldn't because the room telephone wasn't working.  We decided to grab a bite in the restaurant and although the food was good| the service was nowhere near a 10 or a 5  for that matter.  I continuously had to ask the bus boy to get our server who neglected to check on us at any and every point of our meal.  I regret tipping her.The following morning I woke up to dirty pillow cases with mascara smudge and I do not wear makeup| ergo it was a dirty pillowcase.  The shower piddled with weak pressure and I felt "taken" for staying at a rumored nice hotel when in fact it was flawed at every turn.

Londonhouse is far more style than substance. My wife and I were really looking forward to staying at the hotel during our time in Chicago. Overall| we were pretty disappointed. At check-in| the staff member upsold me on a suite with ceiling-to-floor window overlooking Lake Michigan. I was excited about the view| only to find out that Trump Tower was smack in front of the hotel. Not really the hotel's fault.There were several issues with the entertainment system. While the hotel boasted that you could log in to the various streaming platforms on offer (Netflix| Hulu etc)| that feature didn't really work. Talked to reception several times but they didn't help. After we ordered room service and asked for an extra set of silverware| it took the staff close to 20-25 minutes to get it for us. Finally| on the last day of our stay| the cleaning crew was literally standing outside our suite at least an hour before check-out time| waiting for us to leave. Every time I walked out of the suite| they asked me if we were checking out. They eventually lost patience and walked in even though we hadn't left the suite. Deeply disappointed with our stay.

Despite booking a suite with a separate bedroom | there was very little storage space for our clothes so the cases ended up on the floor for our entire 11 night stay. The staff rarely made up our 10 year olds bed despite me asking twice . They never vacuumed the room when we had spilt something (they did eventually ). No personal interactions. No note of happy Christmas or new year. No little gifts or chocolate like other hotels. No one even asked how our stay was checking out.

In my opinion| the LondonHouse Chicago has the best view location in the entire city.  You don't have to walk more than 1 mile to get to the famous shopping center on the Magnificient Mile.  You don't have to walk more than 0.5 mile to get to the famous food street around the Northstrom Rack shopping center.(behind the Trump tower).  The interior inside the hotel has the unique modern mid-century.  If you have a passion in interior architecture| I would recommend this hotel 100%,Dec 24| 2018,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

The most comfortable beds I’ve ever slept in a hotel ever!!!,Dec 19| 2018,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601
A truly unique property. One could hardly ask for a more convenient location| more comfortable rooms or better service. There is an abundance of excellent food| beverage and shopping options in the area and the roof top bar/restaurant is very well worth the elevator ride to the 21st floor. The rooms are impeccably decorated and remarkably clean and practical. Excellent staff members and ambiance. Highly recommended for business and leisure travellers alike.,Dec 19| 2018,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

This hotel has an amazing location that is super close to shopping and other great Chicago attractions. It has a lovely smell that welcomes you when you enter the lobby and the rooms are tastefully decorated with more masculine decor. The room can be dark at times| and in my opinion could use additional lighting. Although the frosted glass barn door style bathroom door was beautifully designed| I prefer to have a door that fully closes for more privacy.,Dec 11| 2018,5,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

My recent stay at the London House Chicago was TERRIFYING. The first night of my stay was one that still causes me so much distress. At 1:00 am| I heard a few knocks on our door. I woke up to listen what the situation was and if it was a drunk person trying to prank us or find their room. NOPE! This knock also occurred to the two rooms besides us. The knocking began to become more aggressive. When I got up to quietly walk to the door| I didn't see a silhouette of the persons feet so I thought they went away. As I looked out of the peep hole| the person put a reverse peep hole viewer on my door and saw I was trying to seem. (this was by far the most scariest thing I have ever experienced). Once the person saw me| they were POUNDING on the door so hard I thought it was going to break off the hinges. At one point they even threw themselves into the wall in the hallway that was adjacent our bed. I called the Front Desk and was put on hold for 13 minutes to ask them to send Security. 13 minutes is a long time when you're heart is racing and getting ready to defend your self out of deep sleep and ensure your safety. At this point| I was never going to open the door because the person was hiding their identity. The front desk said they would check the cameras and have security walk the floor. After I hung up with the front desk| the knocking had gone away and it was now 2am. One full hour of panic and distress. The front desk never called my room back to ensure I was safe....,Nov 20| 2018,1,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

We loved our stay at the LondonHouse! Great view of the river| comfortable rooms| beautiful bathroom--everything was perfect. The lobby/restaurant is very nice as well as the rooftop bar.

We booked 2 rooms for 5 nights and were disappointed to find that we constantly needed to call Housekeeping to make the beds and clean the cups and replenish the coffee on a daily basis.  This was for both rooms!  We also had to have our pillows changed on the first day as they smelt of mildew.  This is certainly not what we expected from a Hilton Hotel.  If you are looking to stay in Chicago| look at other hotels first.  We would not recommend staying here.,Oct 14| 2018,3,LondonHouse Chicago| Curio Collection by Hilton,85 East Wacker Drive| Chicago| IL| 60601

The Hotel obviously had no control over the EARLY morning Stike Protesters with their loud chanting and drumming.

From service at check in to the wonderful spacious room with a great view| everything was perfect. This time we had just standard customer service at check-in.Then the room was much smaller and the view was just the building next door.

Hotel location was amazing| but the overall service fell short.  For a hotel that has one of the best rooftops and higher priced rooms| the cleaning of the rooms (usually only after 14:00)| it took 1 hour to get our bags delivered by the bell boy and even had to load my own bags on the cart fro the taxi and lastly the service at the rooftop was horrible.
