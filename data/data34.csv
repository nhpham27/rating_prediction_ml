Everyone at the front desk were very nice. The only problem I had was housekeeping knocking and entering at 8:00am and again at 10:00am. It only happened on checkout day thank goodness but it was aggravating. They are also not serving breakfast. Which we were fine with we like our sleep lol,Aug 17| 2021,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

This was a nice hotel and the location was perfect! It is not as updated as newer hotels and had an older feeling to it. Even though they said that breakfast in included in the price| they do not offer breakfast and blame it on COVID.,Aug 16| 2021,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
location was great| we didn't like the air conditioning|  which cycled off too frequently. (Fan stayed on but AC compressor would turn off| the room would get warm...annoying if trying to sleep. No complimentary breakfast|  not even grab and go option.,Aug 14| 2021,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
Everything was great except the gdfish left on the chair. Guess the desk chair wasnt cleaned.,Aug 12| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

It was good. I didn't like that we had to pay $66 dollars a day to park after paying $150 a night fore the motel room.,Aug 9| 2021,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
Great value for downtown hotel. Nothing super fancy but the rooms were clean and comfortable. Not having a free breakfast due to covid was the only bad thing about the place. The pool was nice.,Aug 9| 2021,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Hotel was amazing but we park 3 blocks down off rush with parkchirp there scanner dont work so they try to charge you twice. But hotel was great customer service was great also location 5 star,Aug 5| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
I thoroughly enjoyed the flexibility they provided. Especially| Charles at the front desk was amazing. He got me an early check-in despite they were running full.,Aug 5| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
This may not be the fanciest hotel in Chicago| but it was perfect for a casual long weekend in the city.  They have EXCELLENT customer service| very clean and great location.,Aug 4| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
Very nice place,Aug 4| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
Rooms were clean and comfortable.   Staff was helpful and friendly.  Disappointed that coolers with pop and other essentials were lacking products.,Aug 2| 2021,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
Fantastic location.  Quiet area near a hospital.  Parking options were not great| close but expensive.  All elevators were never working so 15 minute waits most of the time.  Only one clerk even during busy times.,Aug 2| 2021,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
Great location.  Rarely did all three elevators work and waited up to 25 minutes.  Not enough front desk staff and manager just stood and watched. Parking is expensive.,Jul 31| 2021,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Room was amazing and the location was fantastic.  With a great ramen shop across the street| two great chicago pizza shops a block away| and water tower mall a skip hop and jump away| downtime was never an issue.Check in was slightly delayed| but with worker shortages post pandemic coupled with lots of late checkouts I'm nothing but sympathetic.As of July 2021 there is still no breakfast due to covid.  The pool and fitness center were operational however and very nice.,Jul 19| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Loved the room set up! I liked knowing no one would come into my room during our stay.  Anything I needed replaced would be left at the door for me.   I wish the “snack bar” area had a better selection of drinks.,Jul 19| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
I've stayed there before and enjoyed it...,Jul 17| 2021,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
We loved that it was a half a block away from Northwestern and the lady at the desk was super super nice. Views from the room where beautiful.,Jul 17| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
Check-In was congested due to it being Friday evening & raining very hard. There was no carts to carry luggage on. So my husband & I had to carry our luggage and packages up to room| where we had to make several trips. Once in the room| cleanliness was good view was beautiful. However| bathroom was very small (we were on in unit 2401) When toilet flush| it had a loud sound. Shower also made loud sound when turning on water. Other than that| the stay was good.,Jul 16| 2021,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Arrival was a nightmare! I reserved a king room at the beginning of May for the weekend after 4th of july and confirmed my reserfation a week before the booking. Despite all of this they had no rooms available in the specifications when i arrived. We were put into a temp room with a broken air conditioner (dissembled) and told that someone would be up to fix it soon after reporting it. After almost an hour I checked back in at the front desk and they said the person was on their way. After going back up i discovered they were moving us to another room...fine. or at least it was fine until we woke up the next morning to find small blood stains on the pillow| sheet and comforter on the bed. Heading tothe elevator to speak with the front again a family knformed us that they had a cockroach in their room the night before. So after missing the first night of a festival AND all the other disturbing happenings I have received no compensation for the chaos and can wholeheartedly say this was the worst travel experience I have ever had.,Jul 13| 2021,1,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

It was a nice hotel| however there was no parking close by that wasn’t 60/90$ a day. We also didn’t know that if you pay with a debit or credit card| you pay $100 a day for a deposit. We were there for two nights & had to pay $200 extra dollars on top of our $400 hotel| for a deposit| that could take up to a month to refund to our card. rediculous.,Jun 20| 2021,2,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

We have stayed here almost every month or so when I come to town to see my doctors at Northwestern.  It always is clean| smells fresh| and no complaints from us.  The desk folk are very polite and helpful.  Walking distance to doctors offices| restaurants| and shopping make it the ideal location.  The views of the city are marvelous| especially at night.  We will be staying again in October and enjoying all this place has to offer.,Jun 16| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

My stay here in May 2021 was good overall. The room was clean and I enjoyed a high-floor stay. Loved using the app to chose my room. However| some things to note are that the room's air conditioning does not do a great job of cooling the entire room. It gets quite hot sleeping with the covers. I was offered to have an engineer visit the room to check but personally did not feel comfortable having them come while we were away and did not want to wait on someone to have this checked out and take time out of our day.Another thing to note is that they were not able to hold our bags before or after check-in. You are stuck with your bags around the city. We were told there is no room for it... the hotel is entirely made up of rooms. This is a pretty basic hotel amenity that simply was not available to anyone.,May 24| 2021,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Hotel has really good soundproof walls| great location| and big spacious rooms. Staff is very nice and they allowed for a late checkout| which was great. The only reason I didn’t give highest excellent rating is because the AC/heater Unit in the room was so loud we couldn’t sleep. Maintenance came and fixed it| or at least tried| but the noise continued and the room actually stopped cooling down to the temperature we set it at. If it wasn’t for that| I would say great stay and I would stay again.,Sep 22| 2020,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Affordable. Convenient location. Chose parking elsewhere to save money - but I do this with any hotel. The staff seemed to be wearing masks and I saw at least one staff member ask a patron to put a mask on when they didn’t already. The room seemed very humid- I’m not sure if the air conditioner didn’t work well| or it was just because it was a rainy day| but things seemed damp which wasn’t great. We were also high enough up (30th floor) that we didn’t really pick up any street noise from below which was good.,Sep 14| 2020,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

You would believe by being associated with the Name “Hampton” and being downtown that this place would be beautiful.  Well it isn’t!  Upon arrival| our room which we first received was cracked open and the lights were left on and the deadbolt lock was missing.  Which is highly suspicious in Chicago.  The second room assigned had a toilet that wasn’t properly working and the audacity of the staff to bring a plunger as if I work there.  This room was $125 and needless to say..... Don’t waste your money.  The name doesn’t precede itself.,Jul 2| 2020,1,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

In the first place i chose this hotel because of the Breakfast Buffet and also the location| Im calling the everyday before my flight here in Miami and they always saying everything's fine and they are still open. When I came in with my friends i didn't know that everything is shutdown they should told in me in the first place so I can book other hotel that is much cheaper because I paid for it ! theres no service at all not even room service. theres no housekeeping everyday. I know we have a virus situation right now but they should allow all the guest to order room service and then serve it with a togo containers.,Mar 23| 2020,2,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
The service was so bad. We ordered food by delivery due to this corona virus that caused restaurants not to accept dine-in. I specified to delivery service our room number and that they can leave it to the front desk. We've waited more than an hr. Then we followed up delivery just to found out it was dropped less than an hour ago. We checked from front desk and the food was there gone cold. How hard was it to lift the phone and inform your guest. The lady who i talked to even told me it's not their responsibility to call me.

The room| breakfast and fitness center were all very nice. Our room was a tad bit noisy with street noise (mostly sirens several times through the night) and we were on the 32nd floor.  We had to wait a few extra minutes for the elevators during the breakfast and checkout rush.  All the staff I interacted with were very good| but we didn't need anything in the room (it was well done from the start).,Nov 11| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
The best thing about this property was it’s location. The rooms are in need of a makeover| furniture very run down. My bathroom had a leaky toilet| someone was sent up to fix it but all they did was turn the water pressure down making it difficult to flush. There was annoying gnats flying in the bathroom| probably because of the toilet issue making it impossible to shower or do anything in the bathroom in peace!  After my rocky check in I really just wanted to go to another hotel| but the prices were really expensive. I’ve always heard rave reviews for the Hampton Inn| but my experience just wasn’t that.😔,Nov 11| 2019,2,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Location is great and this humble three-star hotel competes marvelously with the surrounding four-star hotels. I stayed at a nearby four-star hotel nearby for the first leg of the trip because there was no rooms available at Hampton Inn so I can confidently say that this hotel does a much better job of making sure you feel like your money was well spent. Also there's coin laundry site- BYOP (bring your own pod) $2 per pod..lol.,Oct 29| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Very disappointed| the faucet in the bathroom dropped all night| not matter what you did| I couldn't get it to stop dripping. I had to put a towel in the sink so I didn't have to listen to it all night. Then in the morning I went to shower in the zero entry shower. The drian was plugged. Water was running all over the bathroom in minutes. Then 2 more people had to shower. Talk about a nightmare. Then to get ready to go in the pool of water. I did let the front desk know| they didnt seem concerned.,Sep 6| 2019,2,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

location was great| staff was also very friendly. the only thing that we did not like was the elevators| you post in the elevators what times the busiest but it was crazy how long you have to wait| we waited up to 20 mins one time for an elevator and sometimes the staff would gather some people to use the staff elevator. Other than that the hotel was good.,Sep 4| 2019,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

I liked the location on magnificent mile close to transportation. Clean spacious room. Had requested a roll in shower and the check in staff without even a try promptly said that it is not available and I should have booked “non standard” room. Strict check in times| had to wait until 3:30 pm to get a room. The breakfast room had close to 100 people at a time. There was ample seating space. But there was this tiny little corner where the food was setup. There was so much crowding at the waffle or fruit stations. It was a mess.Elevators were slow and long waits at any point of the day specially during breakfast hours when you have to wait for 20 minutes. The front desk was not too interested in pointing out things to do etc. they would give a brochure with a map and let you figure it out. Overall| for the price I think there far too many options in that location and I will try out something else the next time in Chicago.,Aug 25| 2019,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
Liked the hotel’s central location.  Close to the magnificent mile shops and to the lake.  Lots of good restaurants in the area.,Aug 25| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Good location.  Friendly staff.Clean| spacious room.Clearly insufficient umber of elevators to accommodate 40 floors.. Lot of unnecessary waiting.We were given a room that had a major HVAC unit outside the window.  Crazy noise all evening.  When asked to be given a new room we were told we'd have to pay because we booked through Expedia!Unacceptable response.They know there is a problem with that room and likely the ones adjacent to it but still continue to sell the room to unknowing guestsWon't be rushing back there any time soon,Aug 18| 2019,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

I had asked twice about special rates for cancer patients. First time| I was told to ask clerk upon check in. But then I asked again and was told it was too late!

I liked the location of the hotel| the price and of course free breakfast.  The only thing I didn't like was the price for parking.  However| even with the parking cost it was still a great price for a hotel right around the corner from the Magnificent Mile.,Jul 11| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
The room was nice and the bellman was SO helpful. We enjoyed the rooftop pool. However| the elevators were terrible in the morning| 3 elevators for 40 floors is not enough! It was nice that breakfast was included| but seemed like mass chaos! Not enough room| too many people!,Jul 10| 2019,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
It was great. The only downside was the rooftop pool was a waste| it’s so tiny and full of kids splashing and running unsupervised| it was impossible to enjoy.

Location was excellent. Price was very reasonable.  Breakfast was adequate. The main problem there were only 2 carts to use for getting out of the hotel.people would bring the carts to their room and keep them there for loooongggg periods of time. They either need more carts| or there must be a time restriction on how long people use the carts. I had medical solutions which were too heavy for my husband and I to carry so we were forced to leave them in the room.,Jun 24| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

There is a nearby strike happening and this hotel not only doesn’t warn guests checking in| but happily dumps you into a room near the strike- which starts up every day at 7 am with loud drums and banging and yelling| and goes into the early hours of the night- without warning or explanation. It took us 2 mornings to figure out what was even going on| desperate and sleepy| and when we finally spoke to the front desk we were offered ear plugs and no apology| nothing. Maybe the hotel is generally ok| but considering even through ear plugs| the fan running| and pillows over our heads we could not sleep| I would call to see if a labor agreement has been reached with that hotel before booking.

There is a nearby strike happening and this hotel not only doesn’t warn guests checking in| but happily dumps you into a room near the strike- which starts up every day at 7 am with loud drums and banging and yelling| and goes into the early hours of the night- without warning or explanation. It took us 2 mornings to figure out what was even going on| desperate and sleepy| and when we finally spoke to the front desk we were offered ear plugs and no apology| nothing. Maybe the hotel is generally ok| but considering even through ear plugs| the fan running| and pillows over our heads we could not sleep| I would call to see if a labor agreement has been reached with that hotel before booking. It’s been going on for close to a year| apparently| so it isn’t as if they don’t know those rooms are going to be awful to stay in.

We went to Chicago for a vacation| and selected this hotel due to proximity to attractions and transit options. The staff were extremely courteous and helpful. They gladly checked our bags after check out. The breakfast is a lot better than many hotels| especially considering it is included. (The pour your own waffles are great). This hotel is located a short distance from a pedestrian tunnel to the lake shore| so I was able to take a morning run. It was a little cool out for the pool| but I recommend going up there anyway for a nice view.

Easy access| a clean bed| the staff work hard| but the Hotel itself needs to be updated. The carpet in our room needed replaced. The Restaurant in the Hotel| which they do not own| is extremely expensive and not much to choose from.  We booked on Expedia.com and got rooms by the elevator which you could hear nonstop.

Arrived at with temps -40 outside. A wonderful welcome from both John and Alfredo who were both very concerned I was fine. My room was next to the lift shaft but I was moved straight away.Free breakfast everyday is not to be missed| pastries|cereal|coffee/tea| then a selection of hot items including scrambled eggs and sausage etc.Needed to speak to a receptionist on leaving the hotel for the day and encountered one of the rudest staff members| Annmarie| please be aware your rudeness has an impact| I couldn’t have been more pleasant or friendly to you so didn’t deserve your unfriendliness in return!!! This encounter though was soon forgotten as I then met Lynette who I think was security/ customer service. What a lovely lady and I so enjoyed our little chats each morning. I used the excellent gym each day with the magnificent views over the city. Location is fantastic| 30 seconds to the Mag mile and lots of restaurants and sandwich bars nearby. Red Line subway 5 minute walk. (Chicago)On the last day I was given a late check out until 12| I then left my case in the hotel storage area and was allowed to relax on the mezzanine floor until I was picked up at 1.30 for my flight home to London.No surprise incidentals eg $30 extra a night resort fee that some hotels add on|so breakfast| gym| coffee in room etc were really all included in price of the room.A fantastic stay and thank you to the amazing friendly helpful staff (except 1) You were amazing!|,Feb 7| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Staff was accommodating when they could be and rooms were comfortable. There was a bit of a smell on our floor and the breakfast though free was terrible in taste. Gym was great. Close to shopping and stuff but far from wheat we came for.,Feb 9| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

The hotel is in a great location.  The person that checked us in was not very personable....didn't make eye contact with us during the entire check in process.  The room was clean but small.  So small that we could not open the entry door all the way....otherwise it would hit the hallway wall.,Feb 8| 2019,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Arrived at with temps -40 outside. A wonderful welcome from both John and Alfredo who were both very concerned I was fine. My room was next to the lift shaft but I was moved straight away.Free breakfast everyday is not to be missed| pastries|cereal|coffee/tea| then a selection of hot items including scrambled eggs and sausage etc.Needed to speak to a receptionist on leaving the hotel for the day and encountered one of the rudest staff members| Annmarie| please be aware your rudeness has an impact| I couldn’t have been more pleasant or friendly to you so didn’t deserve your unfriendliness in return!!!

Also there was urine all over the floor in the stairs on one of the levels. But good location.,Dec 17| 2018,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

I was promised 2 rooms side by side and when I reserved the second room| was transferred to their very aggressive sales team trying to sell me a prepaid vacation.  After 10 minutes of listening to the information i| i decided the package wasnt for me and politely declined. The sales girl would not accept my declination and became increasingly aggressive| even insulting me. I finally just hung up.  When I arrived to check in| i was notified that they could not accommodate 2 rooms next to each other and couldn't even get us on the same floor. So I canceled the second room and requested a roll away.  They were unable to accommodate the roll away because there was no staff to deliver it.  Then we got to our room and it was quite cold. I turned the heat up| but it did not run.  Since I was sleeping on the floor| i spent a very cold and uncomfortable night. (I assumed there would not be staff to check our heat if there wasn't staff to deliver a rollaway).  In the morning our room was 60 degrees and I called the front desk. Maintenance came and said the heater was broken and spent some time working on it. The second night of the stay was much better. The heat worked and I had a roll away. The wait time for the elevators was almost 15 minutes and we were 37 floors up| so we couldnt haul our luggage up the steps. Marcus| the midnight front desk person was very kind and did what he could to be accommodating.,Dec 10| 2018,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Last year we stayed here the first week of December| had a wonderful time and chose to come back. We arrived early as we took the train into the city from Michigan City| planning to check our luggage and return to check in.

The upgraded room I reserved (King with studio and sofa) was not available.  So they moved me to a double queen room with NO refund of the upgrade.  The Wi-Fi was so bad we couldn't even stream Spotify.  Crazy long waits at the elevators.  And signs warning you that the elevator wait times are very long| but only eight hours of the day.  Breakfast offerings were paltry--green bananas that were bruised| I'm not even sure how that happens.  The second day of our stay we received no housekeeping because our room "wasn't on the schedule."  The third day of our stay| I had to go down to the front desk at 4 pm and request cleaning service.  But check out day?  That day housekeeping was banging down the door at 8:32 am.

As far as hotel I think it was over priced. Too much noise from the streets| Maybe invest in windows that will keep noise out of room. Hard to sleep at night with that & constantly hearing sirens.

Great location in downtown Chicago close to the Magnificent Mile. Complimentary breakfast with lots of options. Hotel could have been a cleaner in the common areas. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Elevators are tiny and have no air conditioning. Prepare to wait for an elevator for at least 5 minutes. A few of the hotel staff were not very helpful and check in was delayed by a half hour. There were hotel staff striking outside the hotel; I would not have booked this hotel if I would have known there was a strike occurring.,Sep 26| 2018,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

I wouldn't recommend this hotel.  About the only positive is that the bed was super comfortable.  The room had a light moldy/musty smell.  The way the shower is set you literally have to stand against the wall to shower.  The rooms have those old blow out heater/cooler which I always get a cold from.  Breakfast was fine but the room was so insanely crowded and the food set up was weird.  People were knocking into each other trying to get stuff.  All in all just an incredibly uncomfortable dining area.  The staff were not exactly pleasant or helpful.  I could not get on the internet following the directions that popped up on line when I first tried.  When I asked the next morning apparently there were directions to get on a different way other than what shows up on your computer.  Not sure why they didn't give me the directions at check-in.  Over all - a very ENH stay.  There are much nicer hotels in the city for the same price!!,Sep 19| 2018,2,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

My daughter had an Oncologist appointment at Northwestern and we woke up to a shower that did not work and a phone that was not working to even call the front desk for assistance.

We went to Chicago for a concert with friends who were also staying at the hotel. When we able to get into our room we noticed it was rather warm in our room but figured it was because the blinds were not closed. We lowered the thermostat and notified the front desk who said someone would check on it. We left and went to do some sightseeing| came back and our room was STILL warm. Called down again and had someone check it once again. He felt the air coming from the vent and said "It's blowing out air. I don't know what more you want." After he left we lowered the thermostat even lower and left for the evening to the concert we came into town for. Came into the room and it was still warm! It was hard to sleep and felt it was useless to call guest services because we were going to get the same "repairman" (If that's what you want to call him.) Our friends rooms were the same way and we were sweating just waiting for the elevator!,Sep 5| 2018,2,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

There was a lot of disruptive traffic of cabinetry (presumably to be installed) moving into the hotel while I was there.,Aug 30| 2018,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Perfect location| extremely comfy beds and clean room..free breakfast included eggs| sausage| waffles| etc. It really exceeded my expectations!,Aug 28| 2018,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
Great location and comfortable facilities. Bathroom can be a bit bigger and cleaner.,Aug 28| 2018,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
The location was awesome| and the hotel was very nice. My only complaint was the price for parking per night. They charge $60 per night when the sign on the garage offers a 24 hour early bird special for $16.,Aug 27| 2018,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Nice hotel in a good location. The bed was very comfortable. However the temperature in the room was either freezing cold or burning hot. Strange that one degree up or down would make an extreme difference. The shower wasn't that great either| the head was adjustable| but barely. Overall good place to stay while seeing Chicago.,Aug 22| 2018,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

I would stay here again without hesitation| and have already recommended it to several people.  Great room| great bed and bedding| awesome views from the rooftop pool| delicious buffet breakfast.  Loved it!!,Aug 21| 2018,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
The staff was very friendly and accommodating.   The location is great-  just off Michigan and blocks from Lakshore Dr.  However| the building is old and in need of repair.  The bathroom tub had a big tear in the surface and the build up on the showerhead was unsightly.   I ended up cleaning the showerhead before use. There were also large stains on the wall under the sink.  The wait times for an elevator can be long| but the staff open up the service elevator during peak times (i.e. the breakfast rush).  I realize that location drives the price| but the bathroom seemed incongruous with a room in this price range. The staff| however|  was wonderful.,Aug 21| 2018,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
Location is great!  Staff was friendly and very good to deal with.  We arrived early and the hotel looked after our luggage until we returned to check in.  Check in was quick and easy.  Free breakfast was included.  Lots of hot and cold variety at breakfast.  Could have someone walking around wiping tables as people leave as it was busy.  The rooms were huge!  We had two queen beds| sofa bed| cocktail table| desk| big room off the bathroom.  The view was some more buildings but that was a great view at night.  We were right by the hospital so we thought the sirens would keep us awake but they didn’t.  The housekeeper was very friendly and actually asked if there was anything we needed.  The location of this hotel was perfect.  Close to plenty of restaurants and the Hop on Hop off bus.  Would definitely stay here again. Taxis are available at the hotel so we took one to the airport which was cheaper then Uber.,Aug 21| 2018,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

I stayed with my girls 10 and 13.  The pool was really fun.  The room was nice.  I got a king bed with a sofa bed.  My daughter didn't like the pull out mattress and put the couch back together and slept on it as a sofa.  The breakfast was the real deal with hot bar| oatmeal| and waffles. The other reviews warned of a slow elevator.  It was slow| but we expected this.  I found the other guests friendly and we chatted while waiting.  Lots of other families were staying there too.

This hotel’s entrance outside was an ashtray and an ugly planter. Not a good welcome. Reception said gym opens at 10 am and that maintenance would have to let me in if I wanted go earlier.

Loved the hotel and the area was close to everything. My only gripe was the $60 / night parking fee and the morning we left I called ahead to get my car and they brought the wrong car and then argued with me that it was my car...

위치가 매우 좋았다. 존행콕 센터도 가까웠고 매그니피선트 1마일 바로 뒤라서 관광하기에 좋았다. 주변도 안전하고 깨끗해서 편리하였다. 다만 호텔 주차비가 시카고 시내라서 좀 비싼편이고 대부분의 직원들은 매우 친절했으나 일부 직원들은 아직 외국인에게 좀 불친절해보였다. 무료 아침 식사는 맛있었고 음식관리도 좋았다. 옥상 수영장도 좋았으나 풀사이드에 관리자가 없어서좀 거칠게 노는 애들 관리가 안되었다.,Jul 22| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

This hotel has a great location| and had a great price. Everything was great| but guests should be aware of the issues they have with their elevators. I have never been to a hotel that openly warns you with signs in the elevator| and lobby about the speeds and wait times for elevators. I found that odd until I tried to get on an elevator in the morning. Every morning we waited in excess of 15 minutes for an elevator down. Some mornings we would wait for 4 or 5 elevators that were full of people. Normally I would not have waited and would have just taken the stairs but I have two small kids. One morning we took the stairs down to the private elevators on the 13th floor and rode those. Another morning after waiting for 20 minutes| with literally a line of people on our floor waiting to get down| so we took the elevator up (getting an up elevator happens instantly| going down is where the wait is) to the top floor and then rode it down past all the waiting people. The hotel itself is great| but be prepared to have your mind blown with how inefficient their elevators are. Maybe the price reflects that| but your sanity will be tested and you will wonder whether spending a few more dollars to ensure having a timely elevator in the morning is worth it.,Jun 24| 2019,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
L’emplacement de l’hotel Est parfait pour le magasinage et à distance convenable pour toutes les attractions à pied Ce que j’ai le moins aimé est la propreté de l’hôtel les tapis sont vieux dans les chambres et machine à café désuète,Jun 24| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Bien situé proche de riverwalk| des parcs et du musée d’art| cet hôtel peut convenir à tout un chacun. Les prestations sont conformes à ce qu’on peut attendre : chambres spacieuses| bons lits| café à disposition...Sa piscine panoramique est un plus non négligeable selon la saison et son restaurant associé est tout à fait bon.Seul le parking est un peu cher et la solution alternative| à côté de l’hôtel| plus abordable est à considérer avec beaucoup de précautions ( vérifier les horaires sur tickets avant de quitter la place !!!),Jun 17| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611

Super chambre très spacieuse et excellent service. Bon compromis pour rester pas trop loin à pied (20min) des centres d’intérêts downtown. Pour la chambre où j’étais la robinetterie est à remplacer ou réparer.

This is a good hotel| located close to all the attractions of Chicago| suitable for those who consider their money and value time. large room| it has everything except the mini-bar. but my question about drinking water was given to me at the reception without words. A deposit of $ 200 came as a surprise. as disposable paper utensils for breakfast. breakfast is sufficient. I will stay in it again.,Jan 18| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
the room is great| with much space and everything to feel comfortable and be able to work.I recommand to choose the business offer for the internet because the standard free offer is not doing well.It is quite noisy with the heating system and sometimes you have to wait for the elevators but otherwise service is great and people caring. ideally situated if you want to go for a shopping spree on the Magnificent Mile!,Jan 17| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
Fui en víspera de año nuevo. Está súper bien ubicado| cerca de todo.  En el hotel el servicio de limpieza es bueno.  Personal bilingüe.Tuve un inconveniente en el país| y pienso que la chica de recepción no lo manejo bien:  Mi tarjeta fue bloqueada porque intentaron robarla y no lo supe hasta que el hotel me lo hizo saber porque no pudieron hacer el cargo de garantía.  Sin embargo la reserva estaba Pre-pagada 1 semana antes de mi llegada al país vía online (fueron dos cargos separados).  Aún así el hotel me bloqueó la tarjeta de entrada a la habitación| tuve que decirles ya te pre pagué la reserva y estoy desde hace 3 días en el hotel| como bloquearme y no notificarme antes.  Un Supervisor conversó con la Recepcionista y me desbloquearon la tarjeta de habitación.El desayuno fue el mismo durante 6 días.,Jan 8| 2019,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,160 E Huron Street| Chicago| IL| 60611
