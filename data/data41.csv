Nice five star hotel;  big rooms; day ligh used nicely  - well maintained. Hotel location is good; facilies are goodJust we did not like "cleaning on demand" for house-keeping ( I guess due to covid issues) We are glad for the saty overall.

Average property for this level of hotel. The good part is that they have a microwave oven for public access during this pandemic. Cons was that the staff service was bad to be honest.,May 2| 2021,3,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001

Overall hotel experience was good. Valet was frustrating| the front was full of cars so we pulled into an empty space. Then we were asked to move the car into another empty space. The point of valet is they move the car for you. We also got charged by the valet app as well as the hotel so we got charged twice. However| the hotel was able to correct it relatively quick.

I wish this hotel was in every city!,Oct 13| 2020,5,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001

We really enjoyed our time in the Washington Court Hotel. The employees (desk| valet| doorman) were all very nice and helpful. The room was clean and well stocked with towels| shampoo| etc. Size of the room was comparable to other hotels in the area. We did not use the restaurants| so no comment on those. This hotel is very close to a working fire department| so we did hear sirens quite often. Also| this hotel is about 1 mile from Smithsonians| National Mall| etc. It was a nice walk for us each day| but wanted to point that out for others. It is close to a couple of delis/breakfast locations| but we didn't see very many restaurants for dinner in the area.,Feb 20| 2020,4,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001

Pros:Service was excellent. Requested a shower chair and repairs to the shower fixture and were given quick attention. Housekeeping always had fresh towels.Cons:Wheelchair accessible room was not very accessible. To make the bathroom accessible all horizontal surfaces were removed so there was no place to set toiletries. The large| roll-in shower was very nice but the bathroom floor sloped away from the shower causing the water to pool by the pedestal sink| just where one has to stand with a blowdrier plugged in to dry their hair. A bathroom fixture was loose and broke off the wall and had to be repaired.The room itself was tight with very few horizontal surfaces to set anything on. The beds were only full-sized beds rather than queen sized and the one closest to the window only had enough space between it and the outside wall to close/open the curtain causing the person on that side of the bed (we were bunked two to a bed) to have to climb over the bed to get in and out.The room was clean but there were a few details that made me question what we weren't noticing. IE: when first entering the room the bill from the last guest was still laying on the floor though housekeeping had been in to make the beds and empty trash. Also| the artwork on the walls were hanging crazy crooked. Sounds picky I know| but it makes one wonder what else was missed that we didn't notice.,Jan 21| 2020,3,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001
Facilities charges of US$23 plus a day should be charged upfront when online booking is made. When the hotel charge this at point of check in| It inflated the charges and leaves a rude shock.

Our stay was great from the service to the hotel cleanliness! Our room had a view of Capitol Hill. The only issue we had was that the toilet was clogged for most of our stay so the whole family had to go to the public restroom in the lobby to brush our teeth etc..,Dec 27| 2019,5,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001
The location was great. All major sites are within walking distance of a mile or so. Uber and Lyft| with scooters and bikes are abundant in the area. Nice places to grab a bite to eat| coffee| even Walmart is less than a mile away. Plenty of other people walking and having fun| so safety was not an issue even for a single female.Staff was very nice and helpful| door keeper was always smiling and ready to help. Breakfast staff was great and the breakfast was wonderful. Eggs bacon bagels cereal fruit| hot tea|  coffee were available daily until 11am. Be sure to get this included with your stay or it will be $20 extra.Exercise room was also nice with several treadmills| 2 bikes| free weights and machines for leg curls extensions and abdominal work out. Definately more than I have seen at other hotels.We did not park a car so I am not sure about that but you really don't need it. The ONLY negative about this hotel was the cleaning. There was more hair in our bathroom after they cleaned than before. Not sure how they managed this one but after seeing this| we declined the housekeeping until we checked out.If they correct this I would give it 5 stars easy! Very good hotel for the price.,Dec 27| 2019,4,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001

Nice hotel| but tons of "hidden" fees.  They charge $25 a day for internet| local phone calls| water and coffee in your room.  None of this was mentioned| even when we checked in.  We were told the room was paid for in advance- we owned nothing on checking out except whatever expenses we incurred (i.e. room service). When I booked through hotels.com I had "Free internet" included| yet was still charged (didn't make a single phone call-so I guess we paid $25 a day for two bottles of water!)  When we checked in they also said we didn't have free breakfast.  Looked again the next day at my reservation and it said we did.  I told them about this at the front desk| and they looked annoyed!  The man said that Expedia (hotels.com) didn't tell them about the breakfast.  Other than the ridiculous hidden fees (first time at any hotel| anywhere in the world we experienced this)| the room was clean| comfortable| and close to the National Mall.,Dec 23| 2019,3,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001
Too much hidden fee|1. Parking was NOT include in this price. 57$ extra.2. There are no chances to get a dinner on Sunday|3.

No chocolate milk| coffee not good and people stressed.Only the doorman and people on the lobby was awesome.Make a room a 8am is also terrible.,Dec 29| 2019,3,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001

Our stay was great from the service to the hotel cleanliness! Our room had a view of Capitol Hill. The only issue we had was that the toilet was clogged for most of our stay so the whole family had to go to the public restroom in the lobby to brush our teeth etc..,Dec 27| 2019,5,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001
The location was great. All major sites are within walking distance of a mile or so. Uber and Lyft| with scooters and bikes are abundant in the area. Nice places to grab a bite to eat| coffee| even Walmart is less than a mile away. Plenty of other people walking and having fun| so safety was not an issue even for a single female.Staff was very nice and helpful| door keeper was always smiling and ready to help. Breakfast staff was great and the breakfast was wonderful. Eggs bacon bagels cereal fruit| hot tea|  coffee were available daily until 11am. Be sure to get this included with your stay or it will be $20 extra.Exercise room was also nice with several treadmills| 2 bikes| free weights and machines for leg curls extensions and abdominal work out. Definately more than I have seen at other hotels.We did not park a car so I am not sure about that but you really don't need it. The ONLY negative about this hotel was the cleaning. There was more hair in our bathroom after they cleaned than before. Not sure how they managed this one but after seeing this| we declined the housekeeping until we checked out.If they correct this I would give it 5 stars easy! Very good hotel for the price.,Dec 27| 2019,4,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001

Nice hotel| but tons of "hidden" fees.  They charge $25 a day for internet| local phone calls| water and coffee in your room.  None of this was mentioned| even when we checked in.  We were told the room was paid for in advance- we owned nothing on checking out except whatever expenses we incurred (i.e. room service). When I booked through hotels.com I had "Free internet" included| yet was still charged (didn't make a single phone call-so I guess we paid $25 a day for two bottles of water!)  When we checked in they also said we didn't have free breakfast.  Looked again the next day at my reservation and it said we did.  I told them about this at the front desk| and they looked annoyed!  The man said that Expedia (hotels.com) didn't tell them about the breakfast.  Other than the ridiculous hidden fees (first time at any hotel| anywhere in the world we experienced this)| the room was clean| comfortable| and close to the National Mall.,Dec 23| 2019,3,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001

Front desk staff was rude and unprofessional. Experienced racial discrimination & profiling at this hotel| by front desk assistant manager MAYROSE. There was some miscommunication with regards to  daily ’facility fee’ which was less than $30 a day| I was not informed at check in| I was only informed about a deposit for incidentals. Paid for my entire stay prior to check in by the way. The situation was handled poorly| even up to senior management. Left a bad taste in my mouth about the property. I also just realized I over paid for the ‘facility fee’. I also had issues with the room key not working| and needing to be reset anytime I stepped out of the hotel.

Very well located. Near Capitol and close to subway which makes transportation easier (near Union Station). Bar/Restaurants are close to the hotel too.,Sep 9| 2019,5,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001
Was charged hidden fees| the receptionists were not all that understanding. They have you pay for parking on top of the price per night| they charged us for food that we didn't even eat. Breakfast is not included. There was a hole in the ceiling of our room when we got there. If you can avoid this hotel| do so.,Sep 8| 2019,1,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001

The best part of the stay was a man by the name of Clifton. It’s difficult to find people that truly understand customer service. Clifton mastered this and made our stay enjoyable| as we were first time DC travelers. We will come back and send many friends. This hotel will be our only option in DC.,Sep 2| 2019,5,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001

So happy to stay here.

My co-worker and I stayed at the Washington Court Hotel because the seminar that we attended for three days was held in their "ballroom". Upon arrival| the attendant at the front desk was rude. After checking in and going in to the hotel room| I found hair on the counter of the bathroom and in the shower in the room that I was staying in. When I walked in to my co-workers room| I could immediately see stains all over the outer edge of the fitted sheet and her room smelled musty. After we returned home| we found that the credit cards that we gave to them for $50 "incidentals" (if we trashed the room - which we did not) were charged an additional $79.14 each for "facility fees/taxes". We were not told that our cards were going to be charged these facility fees and did not give our permission to charge them for this. Our original company card that we booked the room with should have been charged these fees. When we called to ask what these fees included we were met with a very rude employee| again| who did not resolve our situation. My co-worker and I have stayed at several Washington DC area hotels and have never experienced these things and we are very disappointing in this  hotel and will NEVER stay there again and will be sure to let our office know not to stay at the Washington Court Hotel on any of there trips to DC.The rooms are duty| the staff (except for the door men) are rude.,Aug 19| 2019,1,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001
Everything else was good| but they have a hidden fee which upset me very much. They charge "facilities fee" of $26.38 daily. They never notified me about this fee until I was checking out. Hotel management said I had to pay because it is "mandatory" fee. It should have been already included in the booking fare or at least notified guests at the time of reservation or when checking-in.

The price and the location are GREAT. The hotel overall is pretty and the staff is friendly| specially the doorman. The cleanliness is TERRIBLE. Our first room had peanuts all over the floor| and the air conditioner duct was throwing out black dust. We asked to be changed and they were very sorry and gave us another room. That other room also had the air conditioner filter NASTY and the ducts| including the one in the shower. Plus the room was really warm at 60F| I guess is because they need to clean the A/C.

Overall this is an okay hotel.  Good for a quick night in Washington if you need to be near the Capital. It looked nice at first glance| but the room I stayed in had peeling paint and could have used a deep cleaning.  There was a good amount of dust and actually what looked like make up residue on the window sill.  One of the pillow cases was stained.  So it was a bit disappointing.  At the price I paid I expected more.,Jul 19| 2019,3,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001

That other room also had the air conditioner filter NASTY and the ducts| including the one in the shower. Plus the room was really warm at 60F| I guess is because they need to clean the A/C.  I did a coffee in the Keurig machine and it came out with small hairs.,Jul 23| 2019,2,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001
never received my deposit balance other than that and lack of parking it was a pretty good stay,Jul 22| 2019,3,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001
The hotel is wonderful special for the location to kind of tour with my family we had a  good time and be able to see some of the many monuments an government places around the Capitol and Union Station.,Jul 22| 2019,5,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001

Great Interiors. Very Comfortable ambience. And especially the service was the best.,Jul 20| 2019,5,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001
Overall this is an okay hotel.  Good for a quick night in Washington if you need to be near the Capital. It looked nice at first glance| but the room I stayed in had peeling paint and could have used a deep cleaning.  There was a good amount of dust and actually what looked like make up residue on the window sill.  One of the pillow cases was stained.  So it was a bit disappointing.  At the price I paid I expected more.,Jul 19| 2019,3,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001
It was very sterile. I felt like I was staying in a hospital. The bathroom was nice but the blowdryer was so old it barely functioned. There were few amenities offered in the hotel itself. The staff was pleasant though,Jul 19| 2019,3,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001
The CJD Foundation has their annual conference at WCH. We return every year because of the location on Capitol Hill| the excellent staff and delicious food in their outlets. The only wish is that the hotel had a pool.,Jul 18| 2019,5,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001
Modern hotel| convenient for Union station and Capitol building.  Room service did not get delivered but management apologised and took money off our bill.,Jul 14| 2019,5,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001
The reception staff were great| approachable and informative. The room service was a bit hit and miss| some days they didn’t replenish  the teas| coffee or water but the reception staff were ready and willing to assist. 5 stars to the receptionists and door staff.,Jul 9| 2019,4,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001

I attended the womenGROW Leadership Summit| and the experience was excellent even before I checked-in. I called to ensure that I could store my luggage prior to check-in| and Cliff treated me as if he knew me personally. He was so warm and welcoming and pleasure to work with from check-in to check-out. Cliff clearly loves the WCH| and it shows in his work. All of the staff was GREAT! The room was clean| spacious| and comfortable. The lobby bar was nice. The only con is the conference rooms were extremely cold. The continental breakfast was excellent and the refreshments and amenities placed around the conference areas were such a nice touch. I’ll definitely consider the Washington Court Hotel FIRST on my next trip to DC.,Jul 3| 2019,5,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001

We really appreciated the spaciousness of the bathroom. We liked the walk-in shower and the absence of a tub. Having a built in bench in the shower is a nice touch for those who might need to use it. We also liked the long shelf in the bathroom that could be used for whatever you want such as toiletry items| clothing| etc.Bed was very comfortable. The room was a bit larger than standard hotel rooms. The location of the hotel to all the national monuments cannot be beat. An easy walk to the Capitol started the beginning of our walking tour.îThe only thing we don't care for is the mandatory resort fee. We don't think there is any extra perk that's worth this fee. Just add it to the base price. The parking fee of $48 seems steep| but we do not know how it compares to other hotels in the area.,Jun 11| 2019,4,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001
My husband| my daughter and I reserved a double room for 2 nights.  The very 1st night was harrowing.  I went into the bathroom to take a hot shower after a long| fun and eventful day & evening out on the town.  After the shower| I tried to open the door and it would not open (even though it was not locked).  My husband & daughter tried to open the door for 15 minutes before they attempted to call the front desk to have hotel maintenance come to the room to open the door.  No one answered!  My daughter called the hotel outside number using her cell phone and was able to get an answer but the person answering sent a security guard who was unable to help.  On top of that the security guard entered our room without knocking.  The security guard called front desk and asked for the "engineer"| but was told that he was not on site.  I had to wait in the bathroom for almost 2 hours before the hotel "engineer"  arrived and opened the door.  Apparently| something had broken inside the door casing that prevented us from opening it.  My husband's hands were all bruised from trying to force the door open.  I can understand| that things malfunction.  What I don't understand is the lack of concern on the part of the hotel staff.  Needless to say| I will not be visiting this hotel again.,Jun 10| 2019,3,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001

The place was nice and clean.  The staff was friendly. My biggest issue was that they charge you $54 a night to park which is ridiculous and no complimentary shuttles.

Our room was spacious and had great vies of the Capital!!

Terrible. Beware. From the beginning the services were a joke. $54 to park per car per night. The tv didn’t work| the hot water didn’t work (yes| seriously)| small amenities were left in the room empty (shower cap box with no cap)| just all around a really poor service experience. When I spoke to a supervisor he appeared to be sympathetic and even laughed when I went over our experience with him (I thought it was laughing WITH me at the time) and offered to come one of the 2 rooms I booked AND offered a food credit for the $20 breakfast Buffett (skip it| 100% not worth it). He gave us $100 towards this| after I mentioned we were a party of 7. I confirmed this again in the AM before breakfast and we were asked to initiate the comp through hotels.com and when I called the general manager| Sam| immediately told me how mistaken I was and that he never authorized this and that I was offered one or the other and not both. He wasn’t the supervisor I dealt with and had ZERO interest in making an awful experience better or in managing an escalated customer complaint. He defaulted to the notes and called me a liar in all senses but pretended to be hurt when I called him on this because he didn’t actually say the word “liar”.

This is a great hotel around the corner from Union Station. The only issue I had was that the blurb on hotels.com said "free wifi". This is not the case.

While in my room my husband and I were laying in the bed and the whole headboard just fell off the wall onto us completely shocked us. it was very disturbing as to why the headboard would just come off of the wall and fall on to us while we were laying in the bed.

Staff was helpful and informative. Above and beyond what was expected. Hotel was priced reasonably. The Valet could take a few lessons on pricing. A facility fee for each day car was in the garage is silly. Our car went in on Friday and never moved til Sunday and we still had to pay a facility fee .. $20 a day when the car never moved.

I paid for this room in full (I thought) when I booked it on Expedia -- $300+ for less than 24 hours. The piece of paper with the "facilities use fee" for $24 that had been charged in addition to what I paid on Expedia and then slipped under my door in the middle of the night was simply tacky. If you want to be five-star hotel| act like one. It's a decent hotel in that part of DC and the staff was nice within the limits the hotel puts on them -- they ultimately waived the fee after I had a fit. But since I travel to that part of DC at least once a month| I won't be staying there again if I can avoid it. I don't need to wake up to the extra hassle. I don't need a hotel that charges me a large price up front for a room that isn't all that great -- this one had peeling paint on the ceiling and was noisy as heck all night. And I don't need a hotel who's staff literally stays up all night trying to figure out how to gouge me further.

If you read the reviews beforehand they do advise you in the reviews of the fees|who can figure out what the fees were for||there wasn't even coffee available to you in the morning in the lobby|it is a good place to stay tho|| I found it to be quiet at least when we were there| the staff were better the second day| obviously not everybody's always in a great mood all the time I get that. hate to say it we ended up going across the street to the Hyatt to use their concier and sit and wait for our night Tour |that was one of the places that they pick up.it was in a good place I just think they should at least offer coffee or something especially if you're going to have some kind of funky fees..,Oct 30| 2018,4,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001

Based upon the price and some previous negative reviews| I wasn't quite sure what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised with my stay at the WCH. It was an easy walk from Union Station| check-in was quick and pleasant| and the room was large| clean| and bright.

2 things left a very sour feeling about our stay. 1st Expedia stated that there would be a $22 fee when we got to the hotel. Fine. We were charged a second $22 fee with the $50 valet overnight parking fee.   That is ridiculous. 2nd we left a pair of shoes in the room| they said they didn't find them| we called less than an hour after we left| they were there.,Oct 24| 2018,1,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001

Price was excellent for a great location. Smallish for major city. Everything clean & orderly. My group unexpectedly hit the bar with 100+ people. They managed it really well. I think the hotel manager was even serving drinks to tables. Restaurant is breakfast only—table service or buffet. We ordered off the menu; it was basic but tasted fine. I’ve slready recommended this lace to friends who travel to DC.,Oct 23| 2018,5,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001
Very nice hotel.  We were on the 16th floor and the ceiling needs to be fixed as I believe they had a leak.  Note that we went through Hotels.com and were surprised to have a 19.95 + Tax facility fee charge for each day.  I don't know what facilities they had to offer as we used nothing.  They could update the TV selection for more sports channels.  Front desk very friendly and helpful.,Oct 23| 2018,4,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001
We were there for a one night stay this past weekend. I asked the front desk the pricing for the breakfast buffet the next morning. This was around 11:30 p.m. I was advised that the buffet would be $16.99/person. The next morning after 3 of our guests dined at the buffet| we were provided with a bill that charged us for $19.99/person. When I asked the front desk why there was a pricing difference| the individual at the desk told me that he was not the person that I had spoken to the night before and there was no evidence that what I was claiming was true. He continued to suggest that I could be lying to him regarding my version of the story so he is unable to honor the price that was given to me the night before. For such a nice hotel| the miscommunication and misleading information that was provided by various members of the staff was quite disappointing.,Oct 23| 2018,3,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001

I was charged for using Internet when it was included in my package.  If I would have not checked the folio| I would have paid for it without knowing.  How many people have been defrauded?,Sep 2| 2018,3,Hilton Washington DC Capitol Hill,525 New Jersey Ave Nw| Washington| DC| 20001
I enjoyed my stay but I didn’t like that I had to give a $100 deposit prior to getting my key. Then I received a bill for fees that no one can really explain why I am charged.
