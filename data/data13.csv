Liked the viewfrom our room| yet the windows obviously didn't get washed on the inside before we stayed.,Aug 11| 2021,1,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017
Beautiful hotel| and the view was breathtaking from the 29th floor! However| I was really disappointed that there wasn’t a microwave| and the refrigerator could only hold maybe 3-4 bottles of water!!! Didn’t see an ice machine either!,Aug 6| 2021,5,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017
Park no good,Aug 4| 2021,4,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017
Great hotel! Very clean| rooms are nice and comfortable. Right price for what you get.,Aug 3| 2021,5,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017
Great location and very friendly staff. Amazing views. We woill stay there again.,Aug 3| 2021,5,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017
I loved this property and will definitely stay there again! Every single staff was helpful and friendly! My view was immaculate and the size of the room fit my needs. Close to everything and easy access to taxis and Ubers. I do however| wish there was an over night kitchen or mini store for toiletries and snacks.  Even a microwave to reheat leftover meals or if I bring my children next time. Other than that I have no complaints and I recommend this hotel to everyone especially Californians who are used to spacious hotels.,Aug 3| 2021,5,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

Really  nice view,Jul 27| 2021,5,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017
Everyone was so sweet and the room was huge with an amazing view! I would definitely stay there again. The receptionist was so nice she even gave us early check-in. Even the barista in the little shop was so sweet. I will definitely return!,Jul 27| 2021,5,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017
I like the location| but the amenities were very limited. I can’t believe it| the first hotel that I have stayed that “SELLS ICE CUBES “Hmmm very disappointing….,Jul 26| 2021,3,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

This was my favorite hotel to stay in pre-Covid. Unfortunately now much has changed and not for the better. First| there is no hotel valet! As everyone knows around the hotel is UN parking and it is impossible to find find parking| so the lack of valet is a huge inconvenience. The clock/music player was outdated and not functioning well. When I called down to have it replaced I was brought an even older version. And finally I was told there were no functioning icemakers in the hotel| and if I wanted ice I had to go down to the ground level to the café and purchase ice by the cup or the bag. I was literally charged five dollars for a tiny bag of ice that could fit in the palm of my hand. Was disappointing because this hotel is beautiful and I absolutely love the views so hoping that they consider changing these things in the future,Jul 25| 2021,2,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

Amazing quality of service ! Words cannot express how polite| helpful and friendly was everyone in the hotel specially  the front desk lady who helped us check in. The location is amazing!!! Walking distance to grand central| Bryant park and Times Square. And much more.

Hotel was quiet| and immaculate| as far as cleanliness.Highly recommend. Staff is courteous and attentive to all requests.,Jul 12| 2021,5,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017
The view from the room and location was good. Lot of places nearby to eat out. The staff was generally nice (meets expectations). But it is an old hotel with hardly any space in the lobby. Lots of mirrors to hide the space problems (pictures on the site are deceptive). I could see ants crawling in the room| linens were oldish and bit soiled. Ratings on Expedia do not reflect reality. Maybe they invested to get the ratings improved artificially...Not sure. Would not recommend the price.,Jul 12| 2021,2,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

No ice available except in the store downstairs where you pay almost $5 dollars for a half a bag of small ice.

Since 9/11 the front desk personnel have s more military/police attitude. I understand the need for security except most hotels in NY manage to do it more subtly. Front desk should be staffed by people that make you feel welcome after a long trip. Also| restaurant was closed. No room service. No gym. Not even a bottle of water.

I’ve never seen a Hilton in such terrible shape...Room was not clean. Multiple stains on carpet| tears on carpet| stains on my comforter| trash under the bed and behind the curtains including a vape cartridge.  TV didn’t work and I called and they said they’d send someone up| never did. On check out I told the woman about all of this and she said she’d talk to the manager and they would email me within the hour| never did.,May 26| 2021,2,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

Very quiet neighborhood.,May 24| 2021,5,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017
The front desk was not accommodating and very rude on arrival. I had a morning flight and wanted to leave my bags or do an early check in but they straight out refused my request. They had multiple people behind the desk but not one that can help with storing the luggage. They did not make the room upon request and stated that they are under staffed due to covid. The room was average| The only thing good was the view. I WOULD RECOMMEND staying somewhere else if you are planning on coming to NY.,May 23| 2021,2,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

Very quiet neighborhood.,May 24| 2021,5,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017
The front desk was not accommodating and very rude on arrival. I had a morning flight and wanted to leave my bags or do an early check in but they straight out refused my request. They had multiple people behind the desk but not one that can help with storing the luggage. They did not make the room upon request and stated that they are under staffed due to covid. The room was average| The only thing good was the view. I WOULD RECOMMEND staying somewhere else if you are planning on coming to NY.,May 23| 2021,2,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

Our stay at this hotel was very beautiful with the city view.

Horrible experience. Rude staff. Due to COVID| no room service. Compromise on standards| but no compromise on price. Quality comes at a price.

And the other issue I did have was that the grill/restaurant that's in the hotel was closed and I was not made aware of that. I had waited till about nine to eat dinner thinking I was going to go downstairs and eat and then when I got down there there was a sign on the door that said it was closed temporarily for unknown reasons. The staff did not inform me that the restaurant was closed and I had anticipated going to eat dinner and have drinks there th.at evening but was disappointed when I got down there and the door was locked| before closing hours.

Like extremely dirty bathroom floor and under the chair in the room there was someone's underwear left.

Like extremely dirty bathroom floor and under the chair in the room there was someone's underwear left. So basically thr cleanliness wise| the room was a disaster and i would not stay in this hotel again. It is the shame as the view was incredible.,Mar 24| 2021,3,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

I loved the location but very dissappointes in the over fall staff and service. Staff wasRude| when I requested roomService I was told i need to give 24 hrs notice. I was unaware of such thing. I was given bedding to do the bed myself. No iron boards in room. Luggage rack was broken. Found items in room from previous stay. The whole hotel smelled of marijuana smoke!

I didn’t like the fact that I walked into my room that was not cleaner or prepared for me even after booking in advance and then still coming after my check in time and completing the check in process before looking for parking.,Feb 17| 2021,2,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

Very food...............................................,Feb 16| 2021,5,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017
There was a vacuum cleaner in front of our door. There were no dace towels. A rose pedal was in the bed which indicated to us the sheets were not clean. The phone randomly rang at different times of the night with no one on the other line. Check in is at 4 and check out eleven... that’s two hours less than other properties... ripOff. The room was nice but overall the hotel looked run down and stale. Hilton needs to update this lobby. We spent good money to stay and didn’t get the same level of service as we would elsewhere,Feb 16| 2021,2,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

This hotel was in a beautiful location overlooking the city.,Feb 13| 2021,5,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017
The most outstanding thing about this hotel is its location; near the East River for great sunrises.  It was a quiet neighborhood| vehicle and pedestrican traffic way down because of the COVID| and the UN being closed. The down side is that customer service needs to seriously up their game!  The front desk staff was largely indifferent| in my experience| except for the Manager on the morning of February 4th who immediately accommodated a request.  The rooms seemed oddly void of real furniture| and there was no real explanation as to why there is no bureau in the rooms in which to store clothing| other than the closet with  no shelves.,Feb 12| 2021,3,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

I liked the hotel itself| the staff and the location. I did not like the mass amount of disturbances in our floor. People going in and out. I tried to call the front desk but didn't get anyone. Also - the bathroom not having a fan is a HUGE mistake. Not to mention the shower head didn't work properly| we had to use the side extension which was very hard. The $15 per day internet charge is also a scam. I loved Hilton but this made me change my mind on that.

Very nice hotel but the walls are not sound proof so you’ll hear everyone. Especially if your in the hallway. Staff was great. Amenities were closed because of covid,Jan 17| 2021,4,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

It looks good on Expedia but the carpet was sooooooooo dirty !!!! The room didn’t look like what i thought it was going to look like. 1 of our pilllws had dirt on it . The room was decent size but the walls were so thin | i literally heard the person next door talking through the walls,Jan 18| 2021,3,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

It was great. The view was phenomenal and the room was so comfortable. The only downside was the parking. There was a lot of parking lots but expensive. Other than that I enjoyed the trip.,Jan 18| 2021,5,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017
The stay was ok..when we got there the bathroom was still dirty hair in the shower and on the floor. There wasn’t a microwave for us to heat up our food.

i was looking forward to great view from my bed| however in my room (triangle shape) I had to walk to window to catch the skyline view.  No service although bottled water was listed in hotel.com so had to go out daily to get water.  Also had to take garbage out daily.  Wish hotel had specified means for garbage pickup.  I am familiar with area so easily navigated surroundings.,Dec 1| 2020,3,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

Room is nice. Bathroom is the best part. But the hotel is a bit run down and unloved and the staff are below par. Requests for anything had to be made multiple times.,Nov 1| 2020,3,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

Very clean and amazing view of the city. Close to many restaurants so amazing location. If you drive there however| the hotel does not have a garage so parking your car for your stay may be a concern. I found a paying garage near it however that was about a good 3 minute walk so there is a solution. Just would have been amazing if the hotel itself provided a parking area for its guests. Otherwise great experience. Would recommend and come back,Oct 26| 2020,5,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017
So my room was on the 32nd floor... I get up there and my key didn't work. So I had to go back down to get a new one. Go allllll the way back up and that key didn't work. So security had to come change the battery on the door. I finally get into the room and it's nothing like the room advertised| it smelled like old cigarettes and they had no wash clothes in the room. Definitely won't stay there again.,Oct 26| 2020,1,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

It was ok.... the pictures aren’t the same as the room. I picked the hotel because of the large windows. I wanted to wake up to a beautiful view in the morning. Room was a good size & the bed was comfortable. The bathroom had a weird smell to it. Definitely would recommend on bringing ur own cleaning products.

It’s a five star and the management decided to keep it open. This been| there shud be adequate service available to guests.

The hotel is clean| safe| and almost close to tourist attractions. Times Square is like 20 min walking and the rest of the sites| I took an Uber. There is a good pizza spot and breakfast cafe close by.

Great looking hotel but definitely need better attention and service especially with Covid room wise since got there my room wasn’t clean  towels had stain i request new one didn’t got them till i when again downstairs n ask no clean service provide next day bed shot dirty definitely suprice because great hotel,Oct 5| 2020,2,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017
Check in was extremely slow. When I got there there was only one person at the desk. There was no line| just myself and my partner. She went into the back and we can just hear the chatter and laughing while we were waiting to be checked in.We finally got a room| headed up just to see that we were given a room that had not been cleaned. There was alcohol everywhere| sheets were a mess and gross| towels all over the floor.We headed back down to the desk and there was now a line. We waited a total of 45 minutes to receive a new room. The person at the desk was not pleasant nor welcoming.,Oct 5| 2020,2,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017
I loved the location and view was spectacular. The check in process was smooth and professional so that was great. I get to the room and the bathroom was not CLEANED! there was a ring around the tub| hair on the floor and dark spots that looked like throw up by the toilet (so gross). After calling down to housekeeping a maid came and cleaned the room while we were in the room (very upset about that). I go downstairs to inform the front desk about the room and the young lady tries to dismiss me by telling me its a housekeeping problem. I was so upset that her coworker had to take over the conversation and give me the business card of the manager to call.,Oct 5| 2020,3,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

The hotel was clean and very comfortable but the internet was not working for most of my stay but everything else was exceptional.,Sep 28| 2020,5,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017
I was rather disappointed to find out the hotel doesn't have an ice machine;  I also tried calling the front desk about 7 times to find out if there was a bending machine & no answer.,Sep 28| 2020,3,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

Stayed two nights and will never come back Although the staff at front desk was friendly| it seemed he was the only guy working in the hotel. The skewed headboard and the dusk layers on the table showed the room had not been cleaned recently. There was no hair dryer in the bathroom and I called three times to both “concierge” and “guest room service” line in the morning and waited for another hour for the hair dryer delivery. In the evening I called multiple times to ask about ice and no answer at all. During the pandemic the everything runs slowly but it’s not an excuse of plunged service to have only couple of staff on duty for two giant hotel buildings.,Sep 12| 2020,2,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

Loved the hotel very nice and clean| however I thought someone would clean the room when we left because that would be social distancing but no one did and there is literally nothing open not even the deli in the hotel. Other than that the hotel was nice and quiet and the view was amazing.

Stayed to enjoys some views of the NYC skyline. We had a corner room and enjoyed views of the Chysler| Empire State and World Trade Center One buildings.  Billionaire row was easily in view also.

So clean and a pretty beautiful space.Exactly what it looks like in pictures| but the window is definitely misleading. The only thing I can complain about is the shower. There is only one glass panel and it doesn't slide over| so there was an issue with water flowing over.

Loved the hotel very nice and clean| however I thought someone would clean the room when we left because that would be social distancing but no one did and there is literally nothing open not even the deli in the hotel. Other than that the hotel was nice and quiet and the view was amazing. There are no stores but around the corner is Duane Ried.,Jul 28| 2020,4,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

I enjoyed our room| I enjoyed the breakfast and the internet was better than expected. I have to point out the breakfast on the 30th floor; it was fantastic! Igor| Mohammed and a third team member who I cannot identify were fantastic!,Jan 25| 2020,5,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017
Very disappointed. Paid extra to go in a corner room but it all corner rooms are conjoining and as a result the noise from the next room is really disturbing.  WiFi went down the second day which was inconvenient. Wouldn’t stay here again!,Jan 24| 2020,1,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017
Good location near Grand Central. Room was fine| really could only find fault with the heating controls which didn’t work so was far too hot.

It was a very pleasant stay for me and my girlfriend. We stay for 6 nights over New Years and had the most wonderful view of the city with buildings such as the Empire State and Chrysler in view. I do think the view was largely part of why our experience was excellent and of course| this is not always a guarantee.

We had a corner room on 39th floor had great views however the soundproofing had a lot to be desired.  Could hear the people in the next room as clear as day and people in hallway.

The front desk staff were absolutely gracious and professional.  The Bell Captain - Ozzie - could not have been more helpful given my challenges of walking with a new knee.  He was knowledgeable and ye not overbearing with respect to his joy of working at this hotel for 40 plus years.  He was kind enough to introduce me to the general manager as I left.  Despite my desire to show my appreciation with a gratuity| he refused to accept it and said| the conversation about diplomacy with me had much greater value.  Pls. share with Ozzie my assessment.

Hotel was great except the staff. Staff( receptionist) was not friendly and did not even look at my eye while talking. She left even before I finished the question about the room. Someone else next to her answered it for me.

Nice location| good view| Hilton standard but wifi more or less didn't work in our room all 4 days and nights we stayed at this 5 star Hilton and no one felt responsible.

The location is fantastic. We usually stay further up near the park| but from now on this is where we will stay. The room had a fantastic view. It was very comfortable. The only thing I wasn't that happy about was that to get ice| we had to call the bellmen and it seemed as if that was not a part of their job that they liked. It also took a long time for them to bring up the ice. I would much prefer to be able to get it myself. I would say that every staff member I encountered was very nice and helpful except the bellmen. They were not helpful when I arrived| and were just neutral throughout the stay. They were standing around talking at night when I'd arrive back from a walk| and never greeted me.

We swapped rooms because there was a wet dirty towel with hair still hanging over the shower| the sink and the shower wouldn’t drain. When we switched rooms we got back into it at night and found out there wasn’t any shampoo and conditioner that they said they would bring up. That wasn’t a big deal but we called down and it took over an hour to get it to the room. No fitted sheets on the bed| not sure if that’s just what this hotel does but I’m not a fan of touching the mattress. Staff was nice. Overall was a nice place but must have just caught it on an off weekend. Good location in order to get around. Valet was efficient and timely.,Jul 3| 2019,3,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

I was to get a two bed room and got one bed with a pull out couch. I had to call to request the extra bedding. They just dropped off the bedding and didn’t even make it up. I also was told on checkin that my room was ready but it would be $100 more to checkin early. I declined. They asked for a $50 deposit and charged my credit card. I didn’t charge anything and at the end I asked them about the $50 and he said they would credit it back. My car parking was charged more for being oversized..SUV. When I went to ask for my car at checkout| the bell hop told me to go to the main desk| the main desk told me to wait outside. After waiting outside for a bit I went back in and at that time the bell hop helped me. The service overall was not what I know Hilton to provide so it was disappointing. I also had to call back to the front desk to ask what the Honors free WiFi password is.

I checked in on Sunday May 19th and checked out May 2oth 2019. Although I had prepaid my booking with Hotels.com I was charged USD$400.00 as a preauthorization in case I had a late checkout. Upon checking out as no late checkout 4 days later the USD400.00 hold was released and only charged the USD$55.00 for parking. All good untill a USD$286.88 showed up as a hold on a late checkout that never happened. I called Millenium Hilton and they indicated it was a mistake and charges were to be reversed ASAP. On the next day charges were still there and once again I asked Hotels.com to handle the matter. They were told a FLAT LIE| and to this date I am veing charged a second time for something that never happened. Either Hotels.com is in cohoots or the Hilton really needs the money.

I liked the location of this hotel. I didn’t like that fact that the hotel is outdated.,May 26| 2019,4,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017
Horrible decor and design. Over priced for its condition.,May 26| 2019,2,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017
I checked in on Sunday May 19th and checked out May 2oth 2019. Although I had prepaid my booking with Hotels.com I was charged USD$400.00 as a preauthorization in case I had a late checkout. Upon checking out as no late checkout 4 days later the USD400.00 hold was released and only charged the USD$55.00 for parking. All good untill a USD$286.88 showed up as a hold on a late checkout that never happened. I called Millenium Hilton and they indicated it was a mistake and charges were to be reversed ASAP. On the next day charges were still there and once again I asked Hotels.com to handle the matter. They were told a FLAT LIE| and to this date I am veing charged a second time for something that never happened. Either Hotels.com is in cohoots or the Hilton really needs the money. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!!!,May 25| 2019,4,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

All we knew was that it is an not so cheap hotel near the U.N. Plaza. As we arrived| Robert greeted us and| suddenly| the hotel became friendly. The check-in was quick| we asked for a room at an upper floor and we received one on the 37-th. The view was breathtaking| the room large and clean| the wi-if pretty fast. Waking up in the morning was a unique experience| the first thing we saw being the Manhattan skyline. We had breakfast across the street| at Mona’s.

Nice hotel| room was amazing| really large - overlooking NYC and Empire State Building - just exactly what I was after for celebrating my husbands 40th.  The gym was ideal with modern cardio and weight equipment and an amazing view of the river and the city.  Young lady on guest relations was a disappointment| very unhelpful| unfriendly and poor customer service| otherwise everyone else was very welcoming and pleasant.  Close enough to Grand Central to catch the subway and found a couple of lovely places for breakfast and dinner along the way.  Would definitely return here in future.  Its a shame that you charge for wifi (unless sat in Reception where it is free)| wifi is somewhat considered a given now in prestigious hotels.  Really like the in room option to bluetooth the music on your phone to the television sound system - that worked really well.  Just a shame no free wifi to support it.,Apr 29| 2019,5,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017
Upon check in we noticed that the "double beds" were smaller than what we thought we booked.  When we spoke to the manager| Tai| she was very unprofessional| rude and unapologetic.  She told us that was their idea of a double bed.   We did speak Steve who is also a manager the next day and he was very nice and considerate.  I visit NY very often and will not be staying at this hotel again.,Apr 29| 2019,2,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

I liked the friendly people who greet you in. I did not appreciate the lack of sensitivity at the check-in to my late arrival.I liked the room view. I didn’t like the long wait with other guests for the elevator on 37th floor for 20 min without a practical reason.

I stay there because of its proximity to the UN. I am on business and so always have dinner in my room while I work. I have been staying at this address for decades and the room service menu and delivery has never been this bad. The food is so disappointing. It is as if it does t comeFromThe same kitchen. It is just thrown together on the plate. This is a reason for meTo look further for the perfectHotel for my visits. So disappointed.

First time in New York| on arrival the reception staff and luggage people were very rude.  No information available in lobby about things to do. No information in room.  It seemed very unorganized and nobody seemed to be enjoying working there. First impressions count . They need to work on their customer service in all areas of the hotel .,Jan 4| 2019,2,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

The location is good and the views are impressive. It has a gym| but the elevator access to this is a little bit problematic as only 2 elevators go to the gym| but there is no way to specially call those elevators| and this could cause delays.  That issue could be solved.  The condition of the gym itself was OK| but some equipment was out of service (who knows for how long) and other prices quite old| but better than nothing!

The concierge couldn’t have been more pleasant| or more helpful. Everything about our stay went smooth as silk. Wait. To use the WiFi| you had to be (or become) a rewards member. Fine—it didn’t cost anything to sign up| although we’re not likely to ever reap any rewards...,Jan 2| 2019,5,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017
The check in process was painful!!  They never staffed more than two people even though it was holiday season in NYC.  The location of the hotel is nothing to get excited about unless you had business at the UN.  The accessible room I reserved was not accessible. That meant another 45 min of messing around to get settled.  The 3 nights I reserved via Hotels.com was sent to the hotel as one 2 night reservation and 1 single night reservation.  That meant our room cards did not work after two days.  More waiting in line at reception to get new cards.  Overall| an adequate property. Nothing special. No exceptional service|  It isn't cheap.

Room was really spacious; more than most NYC hotels that I have stayed in. Quiet neighborhood. Front desk was really crowded probably due to holiday season.,Dec 10| 2018,4,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017
I was a bit disappointed in this hotel.  I knew it would be off the beaten track so I lived with that.  But there was no morning breakfast room service (what????) though no one said anything to us at check in.  Also| they never replenished anything.  So| by the time we checked out (we stayed 3 days)| we were completely out of lotion| barely had any shampoo and conditioner| and| worst of all| had no wash cloths for our final shower.  The view was lovely and people were nice but| at the room rate for NY hotels and given that this hotel is in the Hilton family| I was pretty surprised at that.,Dec 10| 2018,3,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017
WE ARRIVED 9 PM| AND OUR ROOM WAS NOT READY. WE HAD TO WAIT 20 MIN BUT THE FRONT DESK GAVE US COMPLIMENTARY BREAKFAST.  VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THAT,Dec 10| 2018,5,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

Beautiful hotel! Amazing view. The room was very clean. Only gripe it is was difficult to find! There isn’t much by way of the name of the hotel in a place you can see it. We basically just followed others with suitcases. I’d stay here again for sure though.,Dec 9| 2018,4,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

Upon check in the clerk sent us to the wrong wing of hotel and on a goose chase up a tall tower many stories up  in scary elevator looking for room. Back to the lobby we went. Bell desk helped point us in right direction after. Got all the way up to room (another hike in scary elevator) and arrived to a very run down| lack luster room. Not meeting that Hilton standard. Called front desk. Phone just rand & rang & rang & rang & rang. Transferred twice. Finally was put in touch w/ manager Arika. She corrected everything and went above & beyond with excellent customer service. I give her all credit for turning sour experience around!! She put us in a new room and had bellman help w/moving rooms. Offered free breakfast for our 3 night stay. New room had spectacular views & very spacious & clean room. Totally updated from the other. A million times better!!Thank you| Arika! And the two lovely bellman who have been w/the property 40+years. They were a delight. Breakfast had nice spread but didn't taste the best. Location isn't near anything-- two thumbs down for proximity to sights unless you are there to see UN.,Dec 8| 2018,4,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

We booked a room for 3 adults but the room was only set up for two. There was no water or milk for coffees. My friend had to sleep on the floor because a third bed was not supplied despite us checking  at the front desk and explaining the room was not big enough for three people. In fact the receptionist put the phone down on us which was very rude!!!  Overall a rubbish experience for our one night in New York despite the hefty £338 price tag for the night. Would never recommend this hotel and I would like to point out that they blamed Expedia for the mess up!,Dec 3| 2018,1,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

We booked a room for 4 only to find one king bed and a chair that was being passed off as a sofa bed. This was supposed to be an upgrade. We had to move rooms at 9pm and meant we could not go for dinner outside of the hotel as we had planned.

The breakfast was explained to be a buffet and it was a Continental breakfast at most.. Nothing with eggs were available.. Nothing warm on the buffet.. Unless you count coffee.. Very disappointed,Nov 25| 2018,2,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017
There were some annoyances| but overall we enjoyed our stay and would return.  Annoyances: The front desk did not answer the phone when I tried to call ahead twice between flights to warn of our very late arrival. There were some overlooked maintenance issues: the mini fridge did not work| the fancy toilet control had dead batteries. But on the positive side| our room was there when we arrived; Maintenance responded nearly instantly and replaced the fridge; the room was quiet| comfortable and clean; the room had windows that OPENED (a rare thing in high-rise hotels!) so we could enjoy fresh air; and housekeeping was extremely attentive (made rounds in the morning to refresh the (Illy!) coffee supplies| always available for clean towels| etc). The view of the city from our room on the 30th floor was stunning. The hotel has extra security measures due to its location across the street from the UN: these include a circle of bollards outside the front door| and card-key activated elevators-- and the world's most adorable luggage-sniffing pooches! We looked forward to encountering them each time we went through the lobby.  The café in the lobby serves excellent Illy coffee drinks and breakfast pastries/snack items| and the staff were delightful. The location is a very short walk to Grand Central Station| and the neighborhood features many restaurants| from budget to high-priced| as well as a colorful Irish bar (open until 4 AM) with a genuine Irish bartender.,Nov 25| 2018,5,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

This hotel is clearly meant for business travellers| being in the same builing as UN offices and accross the street from the UN headquarters. That does not mean you should be put off if you are planning a leisure trip to New York City.What this hotel does not provide is proximity to places such as downtown and Times Square so that is what may put off some tourists| but I would count that as a plus. You are still on Manhattan and its not as if any of these things are a amillion miles away. For that small sacrifice you get a well appointed quiet hotel in a nice naighbourhood.The hotel is about 3 blocks away from Grand central Terminal so that can provide you with access to the Subway and local Railroads that can get you to anywhere in the NYC Metro area within the hour| New York has an amazing public transport system by US standards.As you would expect from a hotel built to cater for the needs of the UN the staff are very accomodating  and happy to help| I didnt use the bar / restaurant on this occasion| but I have used it in the past and found in very nice altough a little pricey for the neighbourhood.Close to the hotel in Midtown / Upper West Side there are many bars| restaurants and shops that are reasonably priced| located around 2nd and 3rd avenues between 40th and 50th Streets that will cater for your needs without being overly busy.The area around the hotel is very safe.

I did not like that my reservation was given away and I did not even get to check in. After event I came to check in and was told due to high occupancy my room was unavailabe and I wouldn’t be able to check in but other accommodations were made at another hotel. The other hotel did not offer room service or similar accommodations in my opinion at least plus it was 1am and I had just finished partying all night long so they said we could cancel at no charge. I told the manager we had decided to nacelle and her response was “that’s great news!” Yea great for you because you got out of doing your job but was it great for the customer who reserved a room to crash at after an event who is now stranded in NY and has to find a train back to Long Island at a time when all train lines are not in service.

公共の乗り物は使用せず、ハイヤーでしたが便利な場所でした。静かです。ファミリーは少ないと思います。マンハッタンのミッドタウンではなく、初めての場所で国連の前で比較的安全だと思うし、ビューも川沿いだし、良かったです。エレベーターが古過ぎるのか音が凄くてアトラクションに乗っている気分で怖かったです。。,Jul 5| 2021,4,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

公共の乗り物は使用せず、ハイヤーでしたが便利な場所でした。静かです。ファミリーは少ないと思います。マンハッタンのミッドタウンではなく、初めての場所で国連の前で比較的安全だと思うし、ビューも川沿いだし、良かったです。エレベーターが古過ぎるのか音が凄くてアトラクションに乗っている気分で怖かったです。。,Jul 5| 2021,4,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

Disappointed by the lack of services: was not advised about needing to ask for the cleaning of the room! No gym.  Prices at the café are very expensive. The staff very friendly though (thank you all),Jun 15| 2021,4,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

Die Aussicht ist nach wie vor sehr sehenswert! Auch die Gegend ist ruhig und sehr angenehm.Allerdings war ich dieses Mal von allem anderen sehr enttäuscht.Die Sauberkeit war| und das in Covid 19 Zeiten| sehr bedenklich (schwarze Haare am Badezimmerboden| WC und Badewanne nicht wirklich hygienisch sauber| Kaffeemaschine nicht ordentlich gereinigt| Fenster total verdreckt - man sah sämtliche Nasen und Stirnabdrücke auf den Scheiben)| das Personal war gelangweilt| unmotiviert und unfreundlich| das Internet funktionierte ab Tag vier überhaupt nicht mehr. Beim Check out war der Schalter nicht besetzt| und auch die Gepäckaufbewahrung wurde aufgrund von Covid 19 einfach abgeschafft.Für mich war das der letzte Aufenthalt im Millennium Hilton und ich könnte es| abgesehen von der Aussicht und Gegend| auch nicht mehr weiterempfehlen.,Feb 8| 2021,3,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017

I stayed one week and found it well-located in midtown. Silent Location. Rooms are bigger than in many other Hotels in Manhattan. Nice bar for a last drink. I did not use the restaurant| therefore I can't rate it. A nice coffee shop at the Lobby with very friendly staff. Room was very clean| staff absolutely friendly and helpful. Appro. 8-10 minutes walk to Central Station trains/subway. WiFi does work perfectly. I had a room on floor 32 and the view was spectacular (you should ask for a room in the upper floors if available).,Oct 23| 2019,5,Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza,1 United Nations Plaza| New York| NY| 10017
