It was a great stay. This hotel is in a very convenient area for our stay. The subway is steps away down the street. Parking was tricky though we used a lot on the next block over. It was not bad $60 for three days. We took the subway too get around the city. It was our first time and once we learned the routes we were good. Train N was our friend took us too Times Square and Coney Island.,Jul 19| 2021,5,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101

This was literally the worst check in experience I've ever had. They only had 1 person at the desk checking people in and the line was out the door when i arrived at 9 pm. The lobby was unruly and loud.  Backing up a bit| when I arrived I had no where to park my car as it is street parking surrounding the hotel only with a tiny lot that holds maybe 15 cars and costs 30 dollars a day! They really need to make the parking situation clear on their website so people know.  Its a hassle.  The lot is not close to the front door so even when you pull your car in you have to walk far with your luggage to check in and make several trips.  None of the staff help.  They do have luggage carts but they were all in use.  Also you have to leave your key with the desk if you use their parking because the lot is so tiny that they frequently have to move cars and play tetris to last let people out and in.  Also plan ahead so you don't need to leave after 10 pm or overnight if you park with them because they block you in with other cars and get an attitude when you need to leave.  The room was filthy when i arrived|  i cleaned it myself my first night there.  I asked for freshly washed bedding as well as there was an odor on my spread and pillows.  The shower didn't drain properly so every time I showered there was standing water.  The breakfast is basic.. microwavable sandwiches|  waffles| and cereal... big whoop.  Coffee is good and available 24 7. They have a small shop at the desk.,Jun 28| 2021,3,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101

Our room was spotless clean! I was amazed at how clean everything was. I was greeted by Mara| who was super friendly and continued to ask if everything was good. We had an issue with the remote on the tv| but Enzo took care of the problem. There was a pizza/restaurant to get anything 1/2 block away. The room had everything! Dishwasher | coffeemaker| microwave| all utensils| dishes| cups completely sanitized. Halls/elevators immaculate. Breakfast was fresh and good. Coffee in the lobby 24 hours free. I am 68 and lived in NY my whole life. I don't care if I am now visiting anywhere in NY| This is where I will stay! With the corona virus rampant| we felt 100% safe. Thank You Mara and Enzo for a fantastic stay! I have never been in a Hotel that was as clean as this everywhere! We have made this our favorite place to stay We had such a great time and didn't worry about anything. Look| I don't usually write reviews unless it was terrible| but We could not find anything wrong with place. We Love it! We Love it! Thank you for a great stay.

We had an issue with the remote on the tv| but Enzo took care of the problem. There was a pizza/restaurant to get anything 1/2 block away. The room had everything! Dishwasher | coffeemaker| microwave| all utensils| dishes| cups completely sanitized. Halls/elevators immaculate. Breakfast was fresh and good. Coffee in the lobby 24 hours free. I am 68 and lived in NY my whole life. I don't care if I am now visiting anywhere in NY| This is where I will stay! With the corona virus rampant| we felt 100% safe. Thank You Mara and Enzo for a fantastic stay! I have never been in a Hotel that was as clean as this everywhere! We have made this our favorite place to stay We had such a great time and didn't worry about anything. Look| I don't usually write reviews unless it was terrible| but We could not find anything wrong with place. We Love it! We Love it! Thank you for a great stay. See you soon!,Feb 15| 2021,5,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101

Not very professional not helpful in parking our vehicle. Someone actually said to us while we tried parking in the place suggested icon parking that we should cancel our reservations.

I was very impressed by this Hotel.  I arrived fairly earlier than the check-in time so I sat outside in my car to wait.  Unfortunately I had to use the restroom so i went inside and informed the front desk. "Brian" informed me that he lobby restrooms were not open but he would check to see if my room was ready and it was.  Brian saved my life!

The room was spotless clean. The carpet did not appear to be as clean. The TV did not work properly. The front desk clerk tried to repair but was unable to fix.,May 27| 2020,4,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101

Absolutely filthy and disgraceful accommodation. My room was disgusting| rundown and terrible. Breakfast was terrible too. Overall| this was like a homeless hostel level of standard. How can a business offer such appalling accommodation in this time and age is beyond me. Complained to the manager Jessica| she was on the whole: unprofessional. Never again!The only positive was the staff in the front desk: Francis and Marlon were very good. They deserve better gratitude.But the rest is a huge disappointment.,Apr 15| 2020,1,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101

It was nice to be out of Manhattan YET close enough via the subways. My longest commute was to the Hudson Yards which was about 25mins on the subway but compared to Manhattan traffic - that's gold! Also - it's super cheap to buy unlimited metro passes. A real convenient location| customer service was awesome and they even gave great foodie recommendations ... our favourite was Burger Club in Astoria :) Loved the view of the Manhattan skyline especially at night and the rooms were quite spacious ... by NYC standards.

It was nice to be out of Manhattan YET close enough via the subways. My longest commute was to the Hudson Yards which was about 25mins on the subway but compared to Manhattan traffic - that's gold! Also - it's super cheap to buy unlimited metro passes. A real convenient location| customer service was awesome and they even gave great foodie recommendations ... our favourite was Burger Club in Astoria :) Loved the view of the Manhattan skyline especially at night and the rooms were quite spacious ... by NYC standards.

Well located just over the East River in Queens| we found this hotel an ideal cost-effective alternative to midtown Manhattan.The front of house staff were excellent - friendly and helpful. We chose a room with a couch and a kitchenette| so we had enough room for two. The bed and pillows were a little soft for our liking - we asked for hard pillows| but sadly| they weren't any better! Housekeeping wss also friendly and efficient.Like a lot of US hotels| breakfast is included| and a great spread it is too. While they do breakfast| no other restaurant service is available in-house though. There are a couple of washing machines and dryers for guest use in the basement ($2 fee)| but we skipped them when we saw the cleanliness of the washers.The closest subway station was 90 seconds walk away| but it is closed for six months for a complete renovation. Thankfully| there are three other stations a short walk away| all providing quick access to Manhattan. Late night supermarket right across the road| Mexican restaurant next door and a highly rated pizza place just down the street. There are certainly enough eating options nearby. It's actually closer to Midtown than the Financial District.Overall| it was a pretty good place to stay| and if we were travelling there again| I'd be happy to stay again.,Oct 31| 2018,4,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101

This hotel was the perfect choice for our New York vacation.  There are 4 different subway stations within about a 5 block radius that make it very easy to get to any part of the city.  The closest station (only a block away) was closed for maintenance during our stay but it wasn't a bad walk to the other stations.  It was about a 15 minute subway ride to Times Square or a 25 minute ride to battery park to catch a ferry to the statue of liberty.  We purchased a week's pass on a metro card for $32 and were able to take the subway and bus system everywhere we wanted to go.  We flew into JFK on this trip and it took about an hour via the air train and then subway to get to Home 2 Suites.  The service here was fantastic!  They were very helpful with tips on places to eat| routes to take on the subway| etc.  Our room was very well kept and so comfortable with 2 queen beds| a sofa and kitchenette.  Plenty of room to unwind.  Breakfast was good and filling.  It does get very busy between 8:30 and 9:00 but we always found a place to sit.  Waffles| breakfast sandwiches| oatmeal| yogurt| granola and various pastries and fruit make up the breakfast choices.  The neighborhood is nothing fancy but we felt safe.  We did come in late one night and felt a little uncomfortable on a dimly lit street but never had any issues as 4 ladies traveling together.  I would definitely recommend this hotel for your New York trip.,Sep 22| 2018,5,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101

No complaints at all. One block to the subway station (so close but couldn’t hear the noise of it in my room). Beautiful city view. Spacious room (bigger than New York standards). Front staff made sure I knew how to get where I was going so that we wouldn’t get lost during our very first visit to the city. Housekeeping even wrote us nice notes for us to see each evening we got back. I do wish I could remember all their names!!

Excellent place. Very nice staff.  A short block from the Astoria el (N train)| but the el was closed for repairs while we were there.  But it's just a few black to Queens(boro) Plaza| where the R| F| and 7 all stop.  Street parking was free and easy to find.  Subway lines get you to midtown Manhattan in no time.  Immediate environs of the hotel are an old warehouse/industrial district in transition to offices| residences and hotels.  Not charming| but just a few blocks from the main part of Astoria| where lots is happening.  Only complaint is that the couch folds out into a somewhat lumpy bed.,May 30| 2018,5,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101
We will definitely go back to this hotel! Comfortable and includes breakfast- with lots of choices. Room was very clean and spacious. Fitness center was clean and looking new.

Well-designed new property in a rapidly developing Long Island City neighborhood just one or two stops from Lexington Avenue and 59th Street.  Clean| quiet| welcoming.  Big breakfast buffet.  Feels more like a highway motel than an urban hotel.  Lots of families.  Bed was a standard double| not queen.  Sofa-bed felt cheap| though we didn't open it.

Would DEFINITELY stay here next time I visit.,Jun 11| 2018,5,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101
Excellent place. Very nice staff.  A short block from the Astoria el (N train)| but the el was closed for repairs while we were there.  But it's just a few black to Queens(boro) Plaza| where the R| F| and 7 all stop.  Street parking was free and easy to find.  Subway lines get you to midtown Manhattan in no time.  Immediate environs of the hotel are an old warehouse/industrial district in transition to offices| residences and hotels.  Not charming| but just a few blocks from the main part of Astoria| where lots is happening.  Only complaint is that the couch folds out into a somewhat lumpy bed.,May 30| 2018,5,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101
We will definitely go back to this hotel! Comfortable and includes breakfast- with lots of choices. Room was very clean and spacious. Fitness center was clean and looking new. This hotel is convenient to the N W Q R E subway trains - 1-3 short blocks depending on the route. The staff was friendly and accommodating.The online photos are accurate to the room we had during out stay.,May 28| 2018,5,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101
My three new friends(Front Desk  Vince| Francis and Marlon) made my stay very pleasant..They were very courtesy and attentive to my needs.

Well-designed new property in a rapidly developing Long Island City neighborhood just one or two stops from Lexington Avenue and 59th Street.  Clean| quiet| welcoming.  Big breakfast buffet.  Feels more like a highway motel than an urban hotel.  Lots of families.  Bed was a standard double| not queen.  Sofa-bed felt cheap| though we didn't open it.  Would return.,Apr 30| 2018,4,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101

2 minutes to 39Ave N-Line | Room is great| I wish there is some lotion included with 2 soaps too. Bathroom floor was not clean on our 2nd night.

Fine hotel.   Committed| hard working staff.   I like the place and will come back.  But|  they really need to work on the HVAC system.   I have stayed in several rooms and the all have same issue|  AC is bitter cold| and if it's off| the room gets very hot and stuffy quickly.  Their thermostats wont seem to regulate the temp.  The range the thermostat seems to work on is plus/minus 10 degrees.     Best solution I have found is go for bitter cold AC and use the extra blankets.,Feb 26| 2018,4,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101

My overall stay this time was good. I've stayed at this location twice before. Staff is always nice| love the room| especially because it feels like home away from home. Free breakfast options are always satisfactory. My only issue this time is my guest who joined me felt profiled and uncomfortable when he came to the hotel. I wasn't present in the lobby to see or hear what went on. I received a call asking if it was okay to let him upstairs. He asked me in the future not to stay at this establishment which sucks because I love it there.  It's pretty unfortunate that one is frowned upon or looked at differently because of how they are dressed.,Jan 22| 2018,4,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101

We had a great time in our Home2Suites suite room. Everything was perfectly clean and we were welcomed really well ! It's really handy closed to the subway to go to New York City Center.The room was really quiet and breakfast really good.Only thing that we could complain about is the sofa-bed mattress that was not good quality (however the beds themselves have great mattresses),Oct 13| 2017,4,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101
The train transport made it easy to get around. Even ride share - uber|lyft was well priced and easy to use. They include "continental breakfast " but that included hot food with reasonable variety. Trays provided to take breakfasts to your room. We booked for 2 weeks and really benefitted from the self contained room instead of a small "city" hotel room.,Oct 2| 2017,5,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101
Poorly located in a light industrial area with no local activities whatsoever except for construction works. Only plus is that it’s close to subway station| however| due to maintenance works | the trains sometimes don’t stop at this station. Breakfast was included and food was plentiful but quality was mediocre. Room is of a decent size but no in-room safe. Full housekeeping only every 5 days of duration of stay| the rest were light housekeeping. For the amount that I paid per night stay| it’s not good value for the money.,Sep 27| 2017,3,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101

The hotel makes you as comfortable as possible which is a great thing. The surrounding neighborhood however is not! There is a building being built next door and you are right next to Manhattan across the 59th St. bridge in Long Island city Queens so there is a lot of traffic in the morning. It is not worth it also to park your car or bring a car because the $30 parking only guarantees you about six spots and I can tell that they were over selling the tickets. If you choose the park locally on the streets you will be subject to meters starting at 9 AM and ending at 7 PM. And it's $.25 for every 15 minutes| you are lucky if you get a non-metered spot| welcome to New York City ladies and gentlemen. The local transit is right down the block which is a plus you can get to Manhattan in about 5 to 10 minutes.,Sep 14| 2017,4,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101

I had an amazing stay at Home2 Suites| everything was to my liking| from the room to the customer service. Jacob and Susan were awesome!

Our stay was great but checking in and dealing with the lady at the front desk was a pain in the butt. She lacked listening skills. She also treated us like children stating excuse me there's a no party policy. " Um hello lady I'm an adult plus it was New Year's Eve everyone was partying".,Jan 6| 2017,4,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101

This hotel was beyond my expectations. In comparision to all the local hotels in Manhattan this gem in LIC is by far the best hotel i've stayed at. For the price| you are definitely getting a huge room| almost like alittle apartment. I called to request a view of the manhattan skyline and the staff was kind enough to upgrade me without an extra charge. Their service was great. I requested toothpaste and it was delivered to my door under 5 mins. Very clean overall. There is coffee and tea in the lobby until late hours of the night| possibly even 24/7. This hotel is definitely worth every penny| i'd pick this over any hotel in manhattan hands down. Thanm you home2suites!!!,Nov 1| 2016,5,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101
Started poorly. Hotels.com hadn't notified the hotel that I had booked a room. Took about 30 minutes to clear that up. Ended poorly too. Got stuck in the elevator with my daughter for about 25 minutes. The hotel staff didn't seem overly concerned. The rest of the stay was good.,Oct 12| 2016,4,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101
I would do it again and again.  Everything was perfect| from start to finish.  Quiet| beautiful| clean| comfortable and convenient.     I loved the variety they have for breakfast| from waffles to omelettes| and different kinds of natural juices.   It was perfect.,Oct 6| 2016,5,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101
Room was good but that's the only thing. When we arrived at hotel we were told that there is a 100$ deposit that's needs to be put down on the room| which was never specified before booking. They also charged us a 250$ charge for "smoking in the room" because they found cigarette butts. Never smoked in the room we used the 7th floor balcony and instead of throwing them all over the balcony we took them back to the room and threw them in the garbage. Called and explained the situation and they said we were lying. Awful service and nothing but problems since the minute we checked in.

This hotel is a great base for getting out and about seeing the citys sights. It is only a couple of minutes walk to the subway which gets into the centre of Times Square in about 15 minutes. It is also great to stay out of the real hussle and bussle as you can actually get a few hours peaceful sleep! The hotel is clean| rooms very spacious and the staff and friendly and helpful. Breakfast is good| plenty of choice - cereal| porridge| fruit| waffles| cakes pastries and some hot cooked food to microwave. Plenty to set you up for a day exploring. The only thing we found disappointing with the hotel was that there wasn't a bar to have a drink of an evening upon returning to the hotel| and they are also doing building work right opposite which is a bit noisy and annoying. But on the whole I'd definitely recommend the hotel and would stay again!,Sep 20| 2016,4,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101

I stayed here for a week while working in Long Island.  Great room| good bed| working desk and all.  Good for smokers as there is a balcony on the 7th Floor and at the entrance on the ground floor.  Only thing not so nice is the only eggs for breakfast are microwaved (like airplane food) and the coffee is not very strong (but Sonja kindly helped me each morning with this).,Jun 27| 2016,4,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101

We enjoyed our stay overall. Really nice staff and a great location. Only areas where we were not happy was poor sound proofing meant we could hear a baby screaming every night for 2 hours at midnight!.

We needed a hotel near my daughter's apt in Queens and near the subway| this one fit the bill and the January prices were good.  We were very pleased with the large room with a kitchenette| sofa and queen bed. Lots of room to move about and relax| very important since it was January and not so nice to hang out outdoors.  Our room was set up for a wheelchair user| which we are not| but I think it would be nice for wheelchair users| the shower was huge| and had a fold-down seat and bars to hold on to.  The surrounding area is quiet| although some new construction across the street may change that for a while.  The lobby and workout room are clean and pleasant| the breakfast pretty good (not enough fruit for me).,Jan 14| 2016,5,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101
This is a pretty new hotel. Nice room. Very clean. Great to have fridge ETC. The one criticism I have is that the water pressure is poor. Also they keep the hot water a minimum temp so you really can't mix in any cold in the shower to increase pressure. This hotel is nice for a get away but if you are there for business and work outside or get really dirty at work I would consider some other place,Jan 10| 2016,4,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101
The staff at the hotel were amazing and made our stay.They went out of there way to make sure everything was right.The rooms are massive and we had so much room for our party of five.The rooms are cleaned to a very high standard and we would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and relatives. The hotel rooms are full equipped kitchen area/microwave/dishwasher etc  which is more than we expected. The hotel is situated outside the city but this suited our needs and with the train station only at the end of the road its then only 2 stopson the train to the city which worked well for us.,Jan 4| 2016,5,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101

We needed a hotel near my daughter's apt in Queens and near the subway| this one fit the bill and the January prices were good.  We were very pleased with the large room with a kitchenette| sofa and queen bed. Lots of room to move about and relax| very important since it was January and not so nice to hang out outdoors.  Our room was set up for a wheelchair user| which we are not| but I think it would be nice for wheelchair users| the shower was huge| and had a fold-down seat and bars to hold on to.  The surrounding area is quiet| although some new construction across the street may change that for a while.  The lobby and workout room are clean and pleasant| the breakfast pretty good (not enough fruit for me).,Jan 14| 2016,5,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101
This is a pretty new hotel. Nice room. Very clean. Great to have fridge ETC. The one criticism I have is that the water pressure is poor. Also they keep the hot water a minimum temp so you really can't mix in any cold in the shower to increase pressure. This hotel is nice for a get away but if you are there for business and work outside or get really dirty at work I would consider some other place,Jan 10| 2016,4,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101
The staff at the hotel were amazing and made our stay.They went out of there way to make sure everything was right.The rooms are massive and we had so much room for our party of five.The rooms are cleaned to a very high standard and we would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and relatives. The hotel rooms are full equipped kitchen area/microwave/dishwasher etc  which is more than we expected. The hotel is situated outside the city but this suited our needs and with the train station only at the end of the road its then only 2 stopson the train to the city which worked well for us.,Jan 4| 2016,5,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101

Front desk staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The parking lot that they recommended down under the subway train is a little sketchy. Cheap| but I watched the fellow park my car| back it up into a fence and then open my door right into another car door. If you have A nice car| you definitely don't want to park it there. but the room itself was fantastic| the free breakfast is quite adequate| and the sheets are absolutely the softest we've ever stayed in before.,Oct 13| 2015,5,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101

I stayed here for 10 nights. I was vacation so I could see NYC for 9/11. The hotel was phenomenal. Free Breakfast was great. Rooms are in immaculate condition since its a new hotel built 2014| very artsy modern roomy and bright. The staff were so friendly and genuine esp Marlon| Nancy| Jessica| and Lily (housekeeping). Everyone else was also super positive I just cant remember all there names great job. I loved the fact that you had a full kitchen in the room. Beds were really comfy and also had a sofa bed with part view of Manhattan. Neighborhood is ok but your 1 small block away from train and 3 stops away from NYC. This is definitely the place to stay and not pay crazy NYC rates in old smelly hotels.

The staff was friendly and informative. The room was large and comfortable. The room was kept immaculately by the cleaning staff. The surrounding neighborhood is run down| but safe. The hotel was well situated| a block from one subway station and perhaps three blocks from a more central station. There are plenty of restaurants and stores nearby| and many of the restaurants deliver to the hotel. We asked for and were given a room with a good view of the East River over which the fireworks display was done on the 4th of July. There were really only two areas where the hotel needs work: (1) The internet was on and off day and night| and was a real pain to repeatedly have to access; and| (2) Breakfast| other than the coffee| was basically inedible. We quickly located a nearby McDonalds and Dunkin' Donuts which provided us with much more tasty fare. We paid $25/night for parking which worked well| as free parking spaces were in very short supply in the area surrounding the hotel.

Great hotel and value for money.  The hotel is 2 minutes walk from the 39st - Bleebe Ave subway station on the N Q & R lines. This takes you direct to Times Square or 34th Street (Macy's) in 8 minutes and you can go on to anywhere in the city from here. So great transport links.  Cost of a yellow cab inc tip was $60 from JFK (on a meter) but only $50 inc tip on the way back.Room was large| spacious and clean and the staff were excellent and extremely helpful.,Jun 9| 2015,5,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101
Hotel is beautiful| but a sketchy location.  Not what we had expected| we asked for a room on Long Island NOT Long Island city. Very disappointed with the area| actually scared to walk around in the evening.  The whole point of our trip to NYC was to be able to be in a area where we could walk around and such.  We had only a couple of days to spare| so it was very disappointing in this regard.,Jun 5| 2015,5,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101

Home2Suite was very comfortable and convenient. Hotel staff extremely pleasant and accommodating. Great beds. Quick access to Queensboro Bridge to Manhattan.

Free coffee in the hotel was a plus since it was very windy and cold outside.,Jun 9| 2015,4,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101
Great hotel and value for money.  The hotel is 2 minutes walk from the 39st - Bleebe Ave subway station on the N Q & R lines. This takes you direct to Times Square or 34th Street (Macy's) in 8 minutes and you can go on to anywhere in the city from here. So great transport links.  Cost of a yellow cab inc tip was $60 from JFK (on a meter) but only $50 inc tip on the way back.Room was large| spacious and clean and the staff were excellent and extremely helpful.,Jun 9| 2015,5,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101
Hotel is beautiful| but a sketchy location.  Not what we had expected| we asked for a room on Long Island NOT Long Island city. Very disappointed with the area| actually scared to walk around in the evening.  The whole point of our trip to NYC was to be able to be in a area where we could walk around and such.  We had only a couple of days to spare| so it was very disappointing in this regard.,Jun 5| 2015,5,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101
Nice| new| clean hotel near from metro station. Good breakfast. Highly recommended.,Jun 5| 2015,5,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101

Fantastic staff & amenities! Hotel was spotless| facilities were great with the added bonus of complimentary breakfast. Location was not in Manhattan but the Metro station was two minutes walk away & only two stops to Manhattan. Would definitely recommend the hotel & can't wait to go back.,Jun 3| 2015,5,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101
Home2Suite was very comfortable and convenient. Hotel staff extremely pleasant and accommodating. Great beds. Quick access to Queensboro Bridge to Manhattan. Not a lot to do in the immediate neighborhood. But if you are a movie buff I highly recommend a visit to the Museum of Moving Image at 36th Ave.,Jun 3| 2015,5,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101
I had to be in New York to attend a last minute function. This property was exactly what I  was looking for| affordable and easy access to downtown without the traffic.

Breakfast could be improved with more healthy options (gluten and dairy free). Staff very friendly and helpful.,Apr 15| 2015,5,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101
Hotel conditions are great!  The hotel staff people were very nice and informative with directions and helped us navigate the subway system.  The hotel is close to a subway station that will take you right into the city in about 20 minutes.  We stayed with our kids and they liked it to.  Super nice to have a microwave and refrigerator.  Breakfast was also very good!  I would recommend this hotel to anybody looking for a nice place to stay near the downtown area of new york city....,Apr 13| 2015,5,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101

Großes Zimmer mit sehr guter Ausstattung und toller Lage zur Metro. Leider wird es immer teurer. War zum 3. Mal da| 2017 habe ich noch 175€ bezahlt. Dieses Mal ca. 280 €. Sollte es bei meiner nächsten Reise wieder so teuer sein| muss ich auf ein anderes Hotel - es werden ja immer mehr in LIC gebaut| die ca. 100€ günstiger sind - ausweichen. Als Allreisende übersteigt das mein Budget!!! Habe bereits im Jan. gebucht und erst im Hotel bezahlt| was ein kleines Problem war| dass ich auch den zugesagten Preis bekommen habe. Ziemlich lange Suche und viele Buchungen. Ich hoffe| es wird jetzt die richtige Summe angezogen. Aber sonst kann ich dasHotel sehr empfehlen.,Sep 24| 2019,4,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101

Dennoch super Aussicht auf die Skyline und das Empire State.Zimmer sind sehr geräumig und Betten waren komfortabel.In den Zimmern gab es einen Kühlschrank und eine Mikrowelle.Die Klimaanlage kann mitunter laut werden während drs Schlafens.

Hôtel de très bonne qualité. La chambre est spacieuse et l'hôtel récent et bien entretenu. Le personnel est charmant et vraiment attentionné. Le quartier est calme (quelques travaux autour de l'hôtel) et il y a une épicerie à 400m et quelques restaurants. Deux stations de métro pour les principales lignes vers Manhattan. Le passage du métro est un peu bruyant mais rien de dramatique. Un unique reproche| le petit déjeuner est très limite. La salle est un peu petite| mais surtout le service n'arrive pas à suivre l'affluence. Trop souvent en rupture sur le pain et sur les viennoiseries. Les fruits sont limités au minimum : oranges| bananes et pommes.

Freundlicher Empfang - Sehr zuvorkommende Unterstützung bzgl. Transport zum Flughafen - Frühstück ok - Zimmer einfach aber sauber und in einem guten Zustand.

Hôtel de très bonne qualité. La chambre est spacieuse et l'hôtel récent et bien entretenu. Le personnel est charmant et vraiment attentionné. Le quartier est calme (quelques travaux autour de l'hôtel) et il y a une épicerie à 400m et quelques restaurants. Deux stations de métro pour les principales lignes vers Manhattan. Le passage du métro est un peu bruyant mais rien de dramatique. Un unique reproche| le petit déjeuner est très limite. La salle est un peu petite| mais surtout le service n'arrive pas à suivre l'affluence. Trop souvent en rupture sur le pain et sur les viennoiseries. Les fruits sont limités au minimum : oranges| bananes et pommes. Au final une bonne prestation surtout pour New York et un accès facile pour JFK et Manhattan.,Nov 1| 2015,4,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101

Personnel accueillant| situation proche de Manhattan (quelques arrêt de métro seulement! Accès au métro a 100 m)  ce qui est un vrai plus mais le métro aérien est juste en face (bruyant) et il y a un building en construction juste devant.

Hotellet var bra och kändes nybyggt. Metrostationen är mindre än 100 meter från hotellet och är ett måste för att ta sig in i Manhattan. Trots att "Manhattan View" är en del av namnet måste man betala extra för att få ett rum med utsikt mot Manhattan. Frukosten var bra men slutar serveras klockan 9:00 på vardagar vilket leder till köer på 30-40 personer vid halv nio och gör att frukosten tar väldigt lång tid om man inte kommer före klockan sju.,Aug 3| 2015,4,Home2 Suites by Hilton NY Long Island City/Manhattan View,39-06 30th St.| Long Island City| NY| 11101
