Worst furniture and decor I’ve ever seen in a Hilton,Aug 22| 2021,4,Hilton Newark Airport,1170 Spring St| Elizabeth| NJ| 07201
Close to the airport makes traveling easy.  Staff was friendly.,Aug 19| 2021,5,Hilton Newark Airport,1170 Spring St| Elizabeth| NJ| 07201
Disgusting Hotel !! I do not recommend! DIRTY DUST EVERYWHERE| OLD FURTHERING| PARKING FEE PER DAY . This is unbelievable PRICE IS RIDICULOUS AS WELL $200 for 1 NIGHT ! Disgusting,Aug 17| 2021,1,Hilton Newark Airport,1170 Spring St| Elizabeth| NJ| 07201
Hotel was in very bad condition.  Old decor to include old wood paneling with glitter and popcorn ceilings.  The bathtub was painted yellow (years ago I’m sure) and the paint was chipping.  It also over flowed when we showered.  The bed was a little comfy even with the 1980’s leather headboard but other than that it was not a good stay.,Aug 16| 2021,2,Hilton Newark Airport,1170 Spring St| Elizabeth| NJ| 07201

Property is great. My only thing is that Expedia and Hilton’s website never mentioned that the pool is currently closed. We specifically chose a hotel with a pool for our kids to unwind after a long flight.Also| Expedia said “breakfast available”| which I foolishly believed was free| so that was disappointing. Lesson learned| but frustrating as it seems a tad misleading. Overall the double beds were really comfortable| basic necessities| and a nice atmosphere. Just pricey (200/night) for not much included.,Aug 15| 2021,3,Hilton Newark Airport,1170 Spring St| Elizabeth| NJ| 07201

First of all you have an option to park in the lot or garage but dont expect to find a spot in either. After circling around for over 30 minutes i found a spot on the 3rd floor of the garage only to learn there is no elevator so carrying heavy luggage down stairs and in the rain for $24 is just ridiculous.  The bathrooms were gross and need to be updated in the wost way| you know its bad when you feel dirty after a shower because there is mold everywhere...Lastly the AC didn't work and the front desk was unhelpful as well as unsympathetic.,Aug 9| 2021,1,Hilton Newark Airport,1170 Spring St| Elizabeth| NJ| 07201

I spent 3 night here Mgmt telling me there is no housekeeping? I speak to house keeping they said yes they do housekeeping. No pool the whole weekend. No refrigerator in room furniture and walls with dents in them all over this is hilton and it looks like Filton?

The property advertised that it had an indoor pool| i specifically booked this hotel so I could entertain my 2 children the evening before an early morning flight.  Upon attempting to enter the pool I discovered it was locked.  I inquired at the front desk and they told me it had been closed for months.  The front desk staff was rude when I expressed my disappointment.,Aug 3| 2021,2,Hilton Newark Airport,1170 Spring St| Elizabeth| NJ| 07201

The hotel lives up to Hilton standards and there were no issues upon check-in. A mistaken charge to my CC was easily taken care of by a customer service rep. Shuttle service needs a tune-up. We waited nearly 40 minutes for pick-up and when you call the hotel it's a recording stating "shuttle runs every 20 minutes.",Jul 20| 2021,4,Hilton Newark Airport,1170 Spring St| Elizabeth| NJ| 07201

No indication when booking that there was no parking for guests. In a bad neighborhood with no real dining around. Despite booking the room all guest must pay $18-30 to park overnight. With that| the lot is full and it takes an hour to find parking. I’d suggest one business.....hotel that accommodates its guests and provides parking. I mean I didn’t walk there. I was there to drop off. Instead they have a second business extorting people with parking fees. Should definitely indicate there is no parking; parking next door for a fee.

I woke up to a distant view of NYC and loved it. The shop was a tad smaller than I thought and was not a fan of the "community" microwave. The bed is amazing (my loking). Had a burger from the bar| I didn't mind the price but it was big enough to feed 2. I was here for only 1 night (12hr layover to Savannah) but overall very pleased.,Apr 16| 2021,5,Hilton Newark Airport,1170 Spring St| Elizabeth| NJ| 07201

The staff were very accomadating| and the room service was ok. The room left alot to be desired| the sink did not drain| the toilet was dirty| the hot water in the shower was not working. One very apparent issue was the noise factor as the hotel is on the highway that is all you could hear all night. My suggestion is to renovate| update your rooms if you are to compete with surrounding hotels. it is important as a traveler to feel comfortable in your surroundings and first and foremost cleanliness is huge.,Feb 27| 2020,2,Hilton Newark Airport,1170 Spring St| Elizabeth| NJ| 07201

Then my boss changed his mind and I had to rebook and calling the hotel they could not get that charged day back. Terrible policy and will not likely stay there again.

The staff were very accomadating| and the room service was ok. The room left alot to be desired| the sink did not drain| the toilet was dirty| the hot water in the shower was not working. One very apparent issue was the noise factor as the hotel is on the highway that is all you could hear all night. My suggestion is to renovate| update your rooms if you are to compete with surrounding hotels. it is important as a traveler to feel comfortable in your surroundings and first and foremost cleanliness is huge.,Feb 27| 2020,2,Hilton Newark Airport,1170 Spring St| Elizabeth| NJ| 07201

My flight was delayed so I had a late check in. The gentleman at the front desk was rushing to complete my check in which was bitter sweet because I was tired but I also had questions. The next morning I heard a gushing sound coming from the restroom| got up and the toilet was over flowing. I had to call the front desk twice before I got an answer and even when I did I was put on hold. The plumber came up pretty quick but he wasn’t prepared for what he found so he left and returned 10 minutes later. He fixed it but left soaking wet towels on the bathroom floor and said that housekeeping would be by to pick them up. I dozed back off waiting on them| which was no big deal because i was still tired. I woke about 1030 am| two hours after the incident| called for housekeeping to come get the wet towels and bring fresh towels because the plumber used mine. No one came and after 30 minutes I called back| the front desk lady appeared to have an attitude because she asked me to understand that it may be a while because there was a lot going| as though that’s my fault. I got dressed to go downstairs and get the towels myself because I had to be in NYC in less than an hour and was pissed when I saw two housekeepers on my floor laughing in the hallway. I asked if they were aware that I had a leak in my room and needed fresh towel and both said no. I was furious but let it go. The whole experience almost ruined my morning and made me late.,Feb 14| 2020,3,Hilton Newark Airport,1170 Spring St| Elizabeth| NJ| 07201

For a hotel to stay in when you have just got off the plane after travelling for 40 hours this did the job and did it well.  The complimentary shuttle from the Newark Airtrain station and written advice on how to get to Manhattan from the hotel were both a God-send.  It is perfectly clean and comfortable.

Our air-conditioner was broken and while engineering fixed it for a few hours| it broke again in the middle of the night so our room was about 80 degrees. The service was alright but nothing stellar.

The location of the hotel was okay. But there was only paid parking on site.

After a delightful 3-night stay at the Hilton Garden Inn in Troy| NY| my wife and I had a very disappointing| unplanned one-righter at this hotel due to weather related issues with our flight back home that evening.Room #521| a handicap outfitted room had the following issues:1.Bathroom floor grout noticeably dirty/moldy. 2. The flexible shower hose faucet did not stay in place; it sent water in all directions. The fixed faucet was not operational.3.The toilet seat was loose| and missing a bolt cover.4.The bathroom  floor was soiled. We had to lay towels on the floor to walk on it| Yuk!I have photos!Other non-critical but disappointing issues: uncomfortable mattress and pillows. Formica laminated furniture. Internet is not free. We are Hilton Honors members| but since we booked through Expedia| we were not eligible for free Wi-Fi.Finally| the shuttle vehicle that takes you from and to the airport was horrendous. We felt as if we were in a third| close to fourth world country city. The only good thing about the shuttle bus was the paint job. The suspension shocks are shut; the vehicle bounces back and forth and up and down| the wheel chair lift rattles as if the shuttle was reentering the atmosphere from outer space| The seats were hard and covered with a slippery cheap fabric| so we had to hang on to each other to avoid being spilled out. It was almost comical!,Oct 29| 2019,2,Hilton Newark Airport,1170 Spring St| Elizabeth| NJ| 07201
The staff was lovely but only one of the four elevators works and it was filthy inside| so much so that though my room looked clean I wiped down every surface I was going to be using. I would not stay here again. Frankly| I've stayed at Hilton properties before and I was surprised that the place had been allowed to become shabby. In addition there was a strong chemical smell in the room toward morning that I was relieved to leave as I caught my early morning flight.,Oct 29| 2019,2,Hilton Newark Airport,1170 Spring St| Elizabeth| NJ| 07201

The location of the hotel was okay. But there was only paid parking on site. Plenty of other hotels in the area had free parking for guests| so a 10 dollar minimum and up to 30 dollars a day isnt worth it if you have a rental car. Inside the room| the bathroom door wouldn't close properly and most if the furniture was quite worn down.,Nov 2| 2019,1,Hilton Newark Airport,1170 Spring St| Elizabeth| NJ| 07201

After a delightful 3-night stay at the Hilton Garden Inn in Troy| NY| my wife and I had a very disappointing| unplanned one-righter at this hotel due to weather related issues with our flight back home that evening.Room #521| a handicap outfitted room had the following issues:1.Bathroom floor grout noticeably dirty/moldy. 2. The flexible shower hose faucet did not stay in place; it sent water in all directions. The fixed faucet was not operational.3.The toilet seat was loose| and missing a bolt cover.4.The bathroom  floor was soiled. We had to lay towels on the floor to walk on it| Yuk!I have photos!Other non-critical but disappointing issues: uncomfortable mattress and pillows. Formica laminated furniture. Internet is not free. We are Hilton Honors members| but since we booked through Expedia| we were not eligible for free Wi-Fi.Finally| the shuttle vehicle that takes you from and to the airport was horrendous. We felt as if we were in a third| close to fourth world country city. The only good thing about the shuttle bus was the paint job. The suspension shocks are shut; the vehicle bounces back and forth and up and down| the wheel chair lift rattles as if the shuttle was reentering the atmosphere from outer space| The seats were hard and covered with a slippery cheap fabric| so we had to hang on to each other to avoid being spilled out.
