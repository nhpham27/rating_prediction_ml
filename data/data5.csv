Great location and shout-out to all the staff. 5 star service. Bed was very comfortable and room| only on third floor was quiet. Unusually so for manhattan!,Aug 23| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022
The hotel was clean. The staff courteous.  The outside seating need attention.  But we had a lovely stay.,Aug 23| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022
room was very accommodating.  Elevators were extremely slow| and hallways were very hot.  Elsewhere the A/C was fine| but not in the hallways near the rooms.,Aug 22| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022
The hotel is good for the price| but i wouldnt stay here again. The rooms are extremely small. The water pressure is terrible and water isnt very hot. There was barely any complimentary items. No pens. No notepads. One bar of soap| no hand soap. Carpets are dirty| but if your just coming to sleep i guess its okay.,Aug 22| 2021,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022

The place does not offer valet parking as Orbitz states| but offsite parking not too far from the location. The rooms were small but clean. There was no hot water in our shower when we arrived and no hot water in the morning either. We had a busy day in NY so we didn’t use any other amenities.,Aug 16| 2021,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022
This hotel was dirty and very outdated and the air conditioning hardly worked. For the price you pay you could get much more. Our first room had throw up on the floor that didn’t even look like was attempted to be cleaned| luckily we were able to get a new room when we complained about it| the front desk staff didn’t even seem surprised.,Aug 15| 2021,2,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022

First I would like to say that the rooms were clean which is important to me. However| if you want maid service you have to let them know The maids do not come automatically like they have in the past. But here comes the bad part of the stay. The elevators were consistently not working and my family had to walk down the stairs from the 24th floor. Everyday during our stay one of the elevators were not working and many guests were upset.  Some had to get to the airport & this inconveniencewas hoping to make them late. One night we were on the elevator and the elevator free fall dropped 5 floors & then the doors would not open| It was scary & I felt like I was on the Tower of Terror @ Disney. Also| our coffee maker in the room did not work. This was also frustrating. This hotel definitely needs to be updated.,Jul 10| 2021,1,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022

Stayed there over July 4th weekend. Very busy. Elevator was broken leaving only one in use. Waited 1/2 hour for elevator and check out line was a nightmare. Between broken elevator and long checkout line it took an hour to check out. Also there are only a couple luggage carts to bring your things downstairs. Need more carts.,Jul 4| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022
Our experience was extremely disappointing. Elevators went out f service then only 1 was restored to service. The car was extremely slow and extremely small.

As is often the case in Manhattan| check in is a bit stressful. You have to park kind of illegally near the hotel entrance and quickly run inside to check in. The parking is not very close and is on a different street. The first place I went to was not the right one but the nice attendant seemed used to people making the same mistake. The right one was about 100 yards (or meters) further. The GPS becomes less reliable among the tall buildings. Eventually ot worked out fine.No in and out privileges but a car can be more of a hassle in Manhattan.The staff took care of our few needs.One of two elevators broke. Another classic big city occurrence but other than few extra minutes of waiting| it was not too bad. I think the hotel| just like the rest of NYC| was significantly less crowded than prepandemic still.The breakfast was not the usual continental buffet. It was a nice change and quite pleasant. We had booked the room with breakfast included which probably was a good move.,Jul 3| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022

I love the area where this hotel is located. It is super convenient to the subway| easy to get across town| and lots of dining options within walking distance. I also feel very safe in this neighborhood. A very cold room is very important to me and this one did not disappoint! The shower had great water pressure. The bed was very comfortable and the room was very clean. The only downside was the location of my room. It was on the 2nd floor over the hotel entrance. The view was not good| but to be fair to the hotel...I was a late arrival| I did not request a high floor and I did not complain about it at the property. I travel to NYC frequently| so the view was not that important to me. I would definitely recommend this property!,Jun 14| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022

No room cleaning unless requested due to Covid. I appreciated this because it was my first hotel stay since the outbreak and didn’t want anyone entering my room.  Staff was super helpful and added little touches such as remembering and greeting me by name.  Will stay there again next time in nyc considering all the Airbnbs seem to have disappeared in nyc.

Couldn’t find my reservation I made a month out | So I was charged a different rate than what my reservation stated . I even gave reservations number showed the gentleman at the front desk and he still charged my card a higher rate. So I’m not happy with Hilton or Hotels.com.

Pros: The staff is amazing.  They are so professional and friendly.  The location is great and close to subway station.  The down side is the need to spruce up the outdated room.  The shower tiles had mildew/mold| the AC unit was dirty and the mattress cover had signs of previous guests.  With a little TLC| this hotel will be awesome.,Apr 7| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022
Location is far from everything. For a Hilton hotel I expected more it was old fashioned with tiny rooms. Housekeeping also took a pair of gucci socks from my bed and “lost them”. Ronny the manager finally got back to me 8 days later and was rude on the phone. Definitely will not be coming back here ever.,Apr 6| 2021,1,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022

The hospital allowed on support because I drove her I was able to stay until her boyfriend arrived. I was able to sit in the hotel and watch her give birth on FaceTime and cheer her on despite she would not be able to bring her daughter Hasina home. I explained to the staff as they inquired our stay. They offered up condolences and sentiments.

This is the best location in NYC! It is close enough to talk everywhere in midtown but away from the crazy crowds! You can always find thr best non-touritsy places to eat around here.

I was in NYC to visit my daughter and booked this hotel as it was just around the corner| so for me it was an excellent location but even if I hadn't needed to be in this area| I would still recommend it.

Was able to get into my room early.  The staff was nice and welcoming| very accommodating and friendly.  Only complaint was the breakfast.  All the food was cold| and for $23 per person you'd expect food to order to be hot.  So| I wish I'd gone out to a diner. But the room was great!,Feb 10| 2020,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022

Everything was great| everybody was soo nice and helpful| nice room.  Only problem was the elevator.  We were on the 22nd floor and there are only 2 elevators so it can be slow going.  And then one elevator broke so the waits were really long (25min).,Feb 9| 2020,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022

Everything went well. Staff was pleasant and clean room. Appreciated the later check out. The only problem was a really long wait for the elevator. We did strike up a nice conversation with another guest while waiting. I gave up and took the stairs. Lucky I didn’t have heavy luggage. Overall| a nice stay in midtown Manhattan.,Feb 7| 2020,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022
Staff were so friendly and welcoming| always wishing you a good day and offering their help. We also appreciated the flavoured water snacks in the lobby each day.

the staff was very friendly. Our view form the room was less than steller but it was ok as we didn't spend much time in the room.,Feb 3| 2020,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022
Hilton Garden is a consistently clean and affordable place to stay| however| they had only one elevator working and we had to wait a long time| each time we rode (we were on 23rd floor). Had to stop at every other floor on way down and the elevator was soo overcrowded and uncomfortable!Positive notes.... melon infused water in the lobby| very nice staff| great location and clean| spacious rooms.,Feb 3| 2020,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022

I was never contacted prior to my arrival at Hilton Garden and after walking 2 miles to get there| we had to walk again to another hotel.

Pros: Hotel is modern and very clean with good-sized rooms. Location is great for Grand Central| UN| midtown offices. Cons: Wardrobe is smaller than a regular closet. Hallway design puts door close to each other| and when a neighbor's door opens/closes during the night it sounds like your own door is being opened. Elevators are fast but there are only two servicing 20+ floors—and one was shut off every night of my stay| so guests would have to line up and wait in the lobby to get to their rooms for 2-5 minutes at 11PM or 1AM.,Oct 21| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022

We enjoyed the fact that it was very close to the attractions of NYC.- Times Square| Rockefeller Center| Empire State Building| Chrysler Building| Macy's| Central Park| etc. Located on a quiet street and reasonably priced.

Excellent customer service and CLEAN which is very important to me - only thing that was bad was there was only 2 elevators and guests and staff had to wait forever to use them - but other than that it was a great stay!,Oct 28| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022
The bed design is terrible!  Base sticks out further than matters and kept hitting it with shin.  Bathroom door swings out and is awkward getting shower ready.,Oct 27| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022
The hotel rooms are very comfortable and the location in midtown East is great. Staff very accommodating. Breakfast is standard mid-level hotel fare at $15 for a continental and $22 for a full breakfast.,Oct 27| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022

I'm rating this on the fact that I appear to have considerably overpaid| probably the last time I trust Expedia.  Although there are the usual things you'd expect from a Hilton| e.g. comfy bed and pleasant furnishings| I found some aspects lacking such as the shower which was pretty weak.  Two elevators is not enough| we were only on the 6th floor so I would have happily walked but the stairs are signed in such a way that it appears that you'd set off fire alarms if you dared to open the door so it was a case of waiting.Didn't use the bar or breakfast as despite being charged too much for this average room| breakfast wasn't included.Check-in process was slow as the guy was also on the phone doing something else| not sure if it was a private or work call.  On the positives| the rest of the time the staff were vary courteous when entering or leaving the hotel and I liked the free water and cookies in reception.

The pictures on the web made us believe it would be a nice room and a nice area. The area is a little far from the action and 52nd street is a bit blend. The room though is so narrow the four of us (my wife and two kids) couldn’t even be standing in the room at the same time. We had to sit on the beds so one person could go to the bathroom. When we got to the room upon checking in| the temperature was 76F. Who does that? Hotel should had set it up a lot cooler prior to our arrival. Then we tried to bring it back to 68F but never were able. We asked to have it fixed soon or to give us another room (it was 11:30pm so we wanted to go to bed but it was just too warm). They tried over and over to fix the A/C but never were able. They tried to resist to change the room but finally accepted. The new room was still that small (even though they had two queens). Two light were not working and the toilet kept on flushing itself. To top it off| their only parking solution is valet service at... $71 per day! What a scam. Almost $300 for 3 days.

I usually NEVER write reviews but hopefully this can stop someone from staying here and being robbed by the own hotel EMPLOYEES. We stayed here only 1 night and during the time we were gone they got into our luggage and took out $700 worth of jewelry!! First time this ever happens to me| ever! We filed a report on Saturday| July 27 and the manager was suppose to get back to me the very next day and it is July 31 and he hasn't. I've called multiple times and left voicemails and nothing. I am NOT a picky person but this is just unacceptable. DO NOT STAY HERE.,Jul 31| 2019,1,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022

Completely fraudulent and deceptive pictures and room size descriptions on line. This is NOT a normal HGI room - it is like sleeping in a closet you can barely walk in if you have a suitcase.

Pro: Good value - lowest cost for the immediate vicinity.  I also appreciated the security feature of requiring a key card to use the elevator.Con:  it was difficult to walk in the small space between the large desk chair and the bed. I suggest swapping out the full-sized desk chair for one without arms so it can be fully pushed into the desk when not in use| thereby provdiing more room to walk by the bed.,Mar 30| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022
Good hotel that was in the perfect location for us.  From a comfort and usability standpoint there were a couple of minor negative points.  The shower was designed by someone who apparently never used a shower.  The location of the controls relative to the entry was ridiculous.  In addition the controls were very difficult to adjust.  The bed frame had sharp edges.  Be careful at night!  Very clean and the staff was very competent.,Mar 29| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022

The elevator is audible all night even when it's not beside the room. The sheets are incredibly rough--I've never noticed sheet quality until this stay--they literally caused friction burns from turning at night. Clean and good location| with free WiFi in the room| but comfort and quiet are the price.,Mar 28| 2019,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022

Overpriced but under delivers. Had to "reboot" the room key and the excuse was that it was a two night stay. Never heard that before. Didn't want to accept cash for the mini store items. Wanted it on credit card for incidentals. Restaurant service was horrible. Couldn't produce receipt of any type at check out.

I liked the location| but didn’t like that the elevator was right off of my room and had to listen to it all night.  I suspect this is the case for many of their rooms due to how the hotel was constructed.,Mar 22| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022
Reserved a double Queen and they said it was not guaranteed and they would normally have to charge me extra.   They ended up not charging extra.  Frustrating to even have to discuss it when on expedia the option chosen was double queen.,Mar 20| 2019,2,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022

Overpriced but under delivers. Had to "reboot" the room key and the excuse was that it was a two night stay. Never heard that before. Didn't want to accept cash for the mini store items. Wanted it on credit card for incidentals. Restaurant service was horrible. Couldn't produce receipt of any type at check out.

We found exactly what we were looking for for a four-night stay in Manhattan| one adult with two teenagers. The two-queen room was sufficient in size| the mini-fridge and microwave a plus for a quick breakfast "in". The beds were comfortable. The bathroom was good and well-maintained. And it was amazingly quiet at night. The only thing to keep in mind is that there are only two elevators for this smallish hotel with 28 floors| so there can be a wait during "rush hours".,Jan 8| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022

We actually really enjoyed the room and cocktails down in the bar. But having only one operating elevator for 28 floors is unacceptable. It was such a long wait that we missed our train and the elevator my sister was on was awful due to a fight that ensued because of the delays. I wouldn’t stay there again just because of that. I understand that things happen but they knew the day before that it was broken and it should have been addressed then.,Nov 29| 2018,2,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022

We actually really enjoyed the room and cocktails down in the bar. But having only one operating elevator for 28 floors is unacceptable. It was such a long wait that we missed our train and the elevator my sister was on was awful due to a fight that ensued because of the delays. I wouldn’t stay there again just because of that. I understand that things happen but they knew the day before that it was broken and it should have been addressed then.,Nov 29| 2018,2,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022

Everything was very nice during our stay. We only had trouble with our shower getting water on the floor outside of the tub.

We booked this hotel in October 2017| a whole 11 months prior to going on holiday.  Why ?  Because we wanted certain rooms.  The trip was to help celebrate a wedding anniversary and would be our only trip together to New York so we wanted it to be special.  We booked a room with a balcony and full length windows.  Expensive but we wanted something to remember.  When I booked the hotel last year I noticed the room still on sale on the Expedia website.  I e mailed the manager of the hotel who replied saying "I see the reservation and the room assignment that you mentioned. I guess I am a little confused as to the question. The room is confirmed."  When we arrived and checked in the lady on reception called a cleaner and then gave us our room keys.  We went to our room and noticed it was a standard double.  We went down to reception and spoke to the lady plus the manager ( the same guy who e mailed me a year ago ) who told me the room was booked for tonight but we could have it from tomorrow.  We were ( and still are ) fuming. Had we not gone downstairs would we be told it was occupied already ?  Why was it occupied when we booked so far ahead ? Where we ever to be told or where they hoping to 'get away with it' ?  It ruined the start of a supposed magical trip. We had to move rooms to the one we paid for the next day.  Now I haven't been refunded for the extra we paid for that room and had no compensation.  The service is appallingly bad.  How can this possibly happen ?,Sep 7| 2018,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022

Hotel is under construction. No mention of it prior to check in. The road in front was under construction| loud noises inside and outside of building. Also elevators didn’t work for a lot of the stay. Very disappointed in a Hilton quality hotel,Jul 23| 2018,1,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022
The hotel was very clean and extremely well maintained. the location was also quite and safe.

Typical midtown Manhattan mid-level hotel.  Nothing special| nothing bad.  I did not take advantage of any of the amenities.

Chose this hotel specifically because of the queen beds. One review said they weren't queen; they are 60 inches wide so they are. Clean| comfortable beds| quiet| close to the Lex/53rd stop. Small rooms but that's what you get in Manhattan unless you spend big bucks. Had a city view which was very nice so I can't speak to the other views.,Jun 6| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022

Hilton Garden Inn Midtown East is a no frills hotel| but it has the basics in  a superb centrally located midtown area at an affordable price.  The rooms are clean albeit small.

It was a great location and we enjoyed ourselves. The beds could use an upgrade I think. A little firm and lumpy.

Staff really helpful with directions took time with maps. Kuerig coffee maker in room made really good coffee which was very much appreciated for this coffee lover. Umbrellas were put in the lobby on cloudy rainy days which I thought was very considerate. Overall enjoyed my stay. The elevator slow response is the only complaint.,Apr 15| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022
The Hilton Garden Inn located on 52nd Street was great. I booked this hotel kind of last minute| and was very pleased with my stay. I arrived a little before check-in time and my room was ready and in great shape. I've stayed in a few hotels in NYC| and this one felt more spacious than some of the others (relatively speaking). Bed was super comfortable| chair to sit was a nice touch| bathroom was very spacious. It's in a great location right next to the subway but also easily walkable to other areas of Manhattan. The staff were friendly and attentive - they also kept my bag for the entire day after I had checked out since I was seeing a show. I only stayed for one night| but had a great experience - I'll definitely be back here,Apr 9| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022

This is a comfortable hotel with rather large rooms. The staff was friendly and the lobby was welcoming and comfortable. It’s located close to all of the action in the city but not right in the middle of it| and there’s a subway station right around the corner. I’d definitely stay here again.,Apr 4| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022

During checkout there was only one clerk. I was "upgraded to the kings room" yet instead of a decent shower I end up having a walk in shower with a curtain that ruined the whole experience about the hotel The beds are awesome.

El hotel esta situado al frente de la estacion del metro lo que lo hace accesible a toda la ciudad| el sector es agradable y tranquilo| pero cerca a mucho sitios de interés.  El servicio de limpieza hay que programarlo| uno tiene que estar pendiente para no quedarse sin arreglo de la habitación.  Destacable el sobresaliente servicio de Casey en el front desk.,Jul 26| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022

El hotel tiene muy buena ubicación| el personal es muy amable| las instalaciones están en muy buenas condiciones.Estuve 4 noches y nunca hicieron limpieza| por cuestiones de COVID| tenía que ir al lobby para cambiar toallas y pedir artículos de limpieza. Nunca sacaron la basura de la habitación. Dice incluye desayuno y lo que dan es un voucher por $10 dlls por persona. El restaurante es agradable y con buenos alimentos. En general estuvo Ok,May 18| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022

日本のヒルトンとは異なりスタンダードタイプのホテル。可もなく不可もなし。レストランは一つ。味はまあ良い。デラックスルームに滞在したが、アメニティグッズは石鹸、シャンプー、コンディショナーのみ。歯ブラシ、スリッパ、綿棒はないので注意。,Apr 27| 2021,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022

Me encantó la amabilidad de las personas en el front desk especialmente Kianis. Me encantó la ubicación. Está cerca de los lugares más bonitos de la ciudad.

サービスや部屋のクオリティが価格に見合ってないというのが正直な感想ですが、価格については、マンハッタンであることを考慮すれば、標準的な価格なのかもしれませんが、自分の感覚で言うと、それでもやはり少々お高い気がしました。部屋で良かったのは、電子レンジと冷蔵庫が設置されていた点です。サービスでは、毎朝ロビーに用意されているコーヒーが美味しかった点が良かったです。それと、滞在が短くなり、予約していた本来のチェックアウト日の2日前にチェックアウトしたのですが、キャンセル料が一切かからなかった点が良かったです。総合的に見ると、70～80点位の快適な滞在でした。,Sep 15| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York/Manhattan-Midtown East,206 East 52nd Street| New York| NY| 10022

Betalade 1999 för ett rum med två dubbelsängar. Frukost ingick inte men det behövdes absolut inte då vi på morgonen överraskades med en pop-up foodmarket på gatan utanför. Mitt i New York kan man ta en stående frukost vart som helst. Promenadavstånd från Times Square även för en sexåring.
