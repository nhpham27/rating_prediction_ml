Do like-Convinient location near Airport.Did not like-AC system are very loud and system outdated.Bathroom bathtub water draining very slow casing to fill up quickly.Bathroom definately needs modernization.Outdated TV and old remote.No option not to have Vallet and free parking.Expected better,Aug 23| 2021,3,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436
Excellebt staff| nice room| great stay.,Aug 23| 2021,5,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436
Gentlemen who checked us in eas very accommodating.,Aug 20| 2021,5,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436
It’s a terrible hotel| they cancel my reservation and didn’t contact me. The manager was rude and mean| and you can imagine how the staff will be. 0 customer service. Don’t go their guys.,Aug 19| 2021,1,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436
We found everything to be quite nice| clean| and peaceful.The staff there were very professional and took the time to listened  to my questions.  I felt very much at home there.,Aug 18| 2021,5,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436
The shuttle service was great,Aug 18| 2021,5,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436
This property is not as advertised. There is no free parking| required $25   a day valet. The pool is closed and has been for over a year. I paid for a room and breakfast every morning and they did not see that at the desk and I spent half a day on the phone with orbitz trying to get that fixed. When I did| the lady at the front desk still gave me attitude about it| except Crystal- she is wonderful! The room was less than clean and someone had set our room alarm to 4:20am and we have two exhausted children (I’m all for a 4:20 joke but COME ON). There was a “Jesus fish” painted in wax or crayon on our bathroom mirror that was super creepy| sheets had a stain| curtains stained and found old Cheerios and pills around the beds. ALSO even though I paid in full for our stay I was required to put a $400 deposit on my room ($100 a night) which I was not aware of before check in. Do yourself a favor and stay at the Marriott next door!,Aug 17| 2021,2,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436
Everything was good except they did not answer the phone for the shuttle.,Aug 17| 2021,5,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436
They advertise a pool as an amenity and when we arrived| the staff said the pool is closed indefinitely.  They advertise free parking| and when we arrived| they are charging $25 a day plus tax. We had to park on the street. This was not a pleasant stay and we will never ever stay at this property again.,Aug 17| 2021,2,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436

Friendly staff but the scent was not appealing throughout the hotel. The restaurant served stale food for dinner. The chicken (wings and strips) were all bad and the sauces were expired,Aug 3| 2021,3,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436
Recycling available,Aug 1| 2021,3,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436
We were told that he shuttle to the airport is 30 minutes and arrived 5:20am for 5:30pm bus| waited until 5:40 for a shuttle to come but was told it’s for the airline crew| the second one arrived shortly afterwards but it was an unpleasant experience to have to wait almost 20 minutes in the early morning with young kids.And the air conditioner in our room is very very LOUD!,Aug 1| 2021,4,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436

I got charged 2 times for 1 night with my babies. First time when I used Expedia app with my $40 discount on Amex. Second time when I swiped my other cc for deposit. It was a different cc. All in all the hotel was great| clean and beautiful. I used it twice to/from my trip to Europe. I just hope they get back to me sooner than later with my issue.

I like the building| not too big of a hotel. The room size was good too.  It was adequately clean in rooms and hallways.  Dislikes:  No microwaves in rooms. Had to go all the way down to lobby restaurant to use one very small cheap microwave. The refrigerator was not plugged in as we thought and our food spoiled overnight.  The air conditioners are Very Very Loud and I'm not a light sleep.  One desk person couldn't find my reservations under Travelocity and had to wait for another person to figure it out.  The meals in the Restaurant is over priced and not tasteful. Better to eat out or use Uber Eats.  Travelocity did not mention the $100 deductible per night as I recall.  This you had to pay on checking in.  Its Valet Parking Only!  Wasn't aware of that also.,Jul 21| 2021,4,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436
The stay was good | and staff was friendly only problem we faced was even though I had called and asked about airport pickup they didn’t mention that it is only till one of the air train station and not till the terminals .,Jul 21| 2021,3,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436

For starters| the Hitlon shuttle driver was extremely rude!!! When i got to the hotel| there wasnt a line yet the staff seen me standing there and not one person said next. I had to walk up and say can someone help me.

The hotel staff members were extremely friendly and helpful. We were given a corner room on the 11th floor. Since the hotel is located across the highway from JFK airport| heading the muted sounds of planes taking off was unavoidable. But| the limited noice did not subtract from a comfortable stay. The only item not present in the room was a UBS port. I thought that a bit odd for a Hilton hotel.,Jul 20| 2021,4,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436

Arrival was difficult. Shuttle could not pick us up at terminal 4. Would have had to take a train to federal circle. Too much luggage to handle that so had to take a taxi.

It was ok I had better service. When I checked in the staff was absolutely nice and helpful. After that nothing I requested housekeeping just one day out 4 nights and nothing. The bar staff was awesome. That’s my spot,Jul 6| 2021,3,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436
Decent hotel for one night if you need to sleep before a flight the next day. They offer a shuttle to pick you up| but at your terminal of arrival. It requires to take the air train to meet at a specific point. The shuttle to drop you off will drop you at your terminal of departure. It is not too far but the shuttle does a few stops to pick up crews and drop off other passengers. So factor that in. The food is just ok. At the time we were there they would not serve you due to Covid restrictions. It was only “to go”. I don’t mind the “to go” utensils| but the food was really low average and I was very disappointed by the drinks at the bar (cocktails not good| wine not good)Room was very clean and we slept really well.,Jul 5| 2021,3,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436

It was ok I had better service. When I checked in the staff was absolutely nice and helpful. After that nothing I requested housekeeping just one day out 4 nights and nothing. The bar staff was awesome. That’s my spot,Jul 6| 2021,3,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436
Decent hotel for one night if you need to sleep before a flight the next day. They offer a shuttle to pick you up| but at your terminal of arrival. It requires to take the air train to meet at a specific point. The shuttle to drop you off will drop you at your terminal of departure. It is not too far but the shuttle does a few stops to pick up crews and drop off other passengers. So factor that in. The food is just ok. At the time we were there they would not serve you due to Covid restrictions. It was only “to go”. I don’t mind the “to go” utensils| but the food was really low average and I was very disappointed by the drinks at the bar (cocktails not good| wine not good)Room was very clean and we slept really well.,Jul 5| 2021,3,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436

Hotel stay was great accept for terrible parking situation! Valet parking only!! No nearby street parking available!! Had to park and walk 1/2 mile.,Jun 15| 2021,4,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436
The hotel I normally stay at was completely booked so I opted yo stay here. I definitely will not be returning. When you pull up to the hotel it looks like it’s well kept. The lobby area is really nice and check in was smooth. It’s everything else that was disappointing. First was parking. When we got to the hotel most of the spots are roped off fir valet. There were only 7-10 spots that were not roped off and I happened to get one of them. At dinner time I tried ordering from a couple of places using Grubhub. Neither place delivered to the area (not sure why) so I had to go get the food. Of course by the time I returned there was no parking and the valet said the lot was full. His suggestion was to park on the street (no parking) or go over to the Hampton next door. The Hampton had plenty of spots but the attendant there was very rude and gave me a hard time before allowing me to park in one of the Hilton spots (which I didn’t realize they were designated Hilton spots until the next morning). The room was showing it’s she. While the room was a decent size| the furniture upholstery was fading| there were chips in the wood| the shower curtain was piling. It was clean - just old. If you don’t have a car and not too particular about the room this place is fine. But there are better places to stay in the area.,Jun 13| 2021,2,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436
No breakfast. So we are still paying the same for less amenities. I understand| it’s covid. But we have been to other hotels recently that have had breakfast. The front desk said there would be an ala carte breakfast the next morning| but there was nothing| not even fruit. The shuttle to and from the airport was nice and the drivers were friendly.

I have stayed here every few weeks as I fly in to see my girlfriend. I cannot believe that you have to pay to park at a hotel you are paying for anyway. Additionally| the past two times| the hallway smelled like marijuana (very strong odor) and the A/C unit sounded like it was rumbling out of the wall. I'm not one to complain| but I don't think I would want to stay there as I keep flying back to NY every few weeks.,Jun 7| 2021,2,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436

I'm writing this review as I really rely on reviews when booking my stays - so a big thank you to all who do so!Having said that| the Hilton JFK Airport is one to avoid. It wasn't horrific| but this chain should know that business travelers expect more than this from a major brand - especially when this location is charging 50% more per night than boutique hotels in downtown NYC. The rooms are so rundown| they're straight out of 1999.  It seems like management is solely focused on squeezing pennies by not investing in any amenities (even the most basic hotels generally provide complimentary coffee!) Despite the fact that this hotel is in the middle of nowhere (the closest restaurant is a 15 minute walk) the only food option available on site was ordering take out from their bar...and I'm talking $17 chicken fingers. The Starbucks in the lobby was closed. They don't offer any kind of complimentary breakfast. My tv was broken. And you have to request a refrigerator. Save yourself some aggravation and disappointment and book somewhere else. PS - I will give a shout out to their front desk staff| shuttle driver| maintenance guy and bartenders| who were uniformly friendly| professional and welcoming.  It just seems like its their management team that needs an upgrade.,Feb 25| 2021,2,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436
The first room we were in had a very noisy heater when it went only. It sounded like a jet plane was taking off on the room. The staff had us moved in a matter of 15 minutes. They were amazing. I would definitely book in there again.,Feb 24| 2021,5,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436
The front desk representative was phenomenal. After that the visit went downhill. The restaurant messed up my order not once| but twice. The food was bland and overpriced which just made it more disappointing. The thermostat was broken so despite being set at 72 degrees the room was 62-64 degrees all night.,Feb 22| 2021,2,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436

Website said it had a pool| got there and they said sorry it's closed. I ask about a discount since my kids were going to be disappointed now and the desk clerk said no and ask if I wanted to stay at another hotel?

The stay was great| but the room we booked was not accurately described in hotels.com app causing us to have to buck sn extra room at the time of check-in. The description ssid that the room accommodates up to 3 children snd that there is a sofa or rollaway bed available.  When we reached the hotel they said none of their rooms have that availability.,Feb 12| 2020,5,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436

I didn’t appreciate the $25 valet parking. We chose the Hilton because the previous hotel we stayed a month ago up the st advertised parking but their lot was full and we had to park on the st. (and where we parked a neighbor told us we would’ve been towed). So we stayed this time at Hilton who advertised parking and got hit w $25 for the day.,Jan 20| 2020,4,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436

Clean| comfortable| easy shuttle to airport. Free wifi. Took the local bus to the subway into the city. This was pretty easy. Had to wait about 10 minutes for the bus. the bus drops you off right by the subway entrance. Took the same route back to hotel at about 9 pm. Apparently the bus stop going the opposite direction (back to the hotel) is a three block walk in the dark. Felt a little unsafe as a single female. Would probably take subway to Airtran and then shuttle back to hotel if here again.,Dec 30| 2019,5,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436
It’s rare to find a place near JFK that is spacious.  We always stay in the suit and it is very roomy. They used to have free parking.  Now you have to pay.  We park on the street.  We are disappointed longer offer free parking. Thankfully we have always been able to find a spot on the  street. Also they have them indoor pool. For many years we stayed here in the winter knowing our children could use the pool at anytime. They have started closing it in the winter| which is a disappointment.  Finally| there are no food options in walking distance and the restaurant is pricy.  We always have a refrigerator and microwave so we bring our own breakfast.  But a free or reasonably priced breakfast would be a great improvement.,Dec 30| 2019,4,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436

Was difficult figuring out how to get a shuttle from JFK. I don’t travel much and it was confusing at the airport. I got a response from the hotel via Orbitz the next day on how to get to the shuttle. A little too late on that one. Tried calling the hotel 3 times and no one answered so I could ask how to get shuttle. Finally talked to someone in reservations and she helped even though she wasn’t at that hotel. Great food| most employees were very friendly and helpful| comfy bed and pillows| amazing shampoo and conditioner! I wanted to buy some online but you are all sold out 😢Overall a good experience but remember some people don’t travel much and need a little more patience and guidance. Information on how to get to the shuttle and what times they are there should be sent to the customer upon making a reservation. Same thing for departures to the airport. It is VITAL to know they only leave every 30 minutes so customer can plan accordingly.

Something goes off every 15-20 minutes and makes annoying noise. I am not sure if it was AC that you could also hear| but then it would be followed by this noise that wouldn't let you sleep. They may not have this problem in all rooms. I checked in and left the property with personal business and came back late at night; that's why I didn't want to go through all hassle and move to another room.Their breakfast buffet needs pork substitues like beef or chicken sausage/patties. Although they do have pork substitues listed in the menu| the buffet section had one container with bacon and sausages divided. I am not sure if those sausages were pork substitutes (beef or chicken) but keeping it in same container is a no go. The only reason I've picked this hotel is because it is close to JFK (only 3 miles away.) Before this place I had stayed at Mariott| which was even closer to JFK. I just wanted to try a new place thinking it might be a better experience considering it was a bit higher in price than Mariott. This was the time when higher price didn't mean better experience. At Mariott I didn't have any noise issues in my room and breakfast was better and complimentary. Whereas at Hilton breakfast is not complimentary.If you're lucky enough to get a room that doesn't have any noise problems and you don't care about breakfast because you are planning to have it somewhere else then this place is good overall. Property is clean and staff is friendly. I would rate my experience 3/5,Nov 15| 2019,3,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436

Something goes off every 15-20 minutes and makes annoying noise. I am not sure if it was AC that you could also hear| but then it would be followed by this noise that wouldn't let you sleep. They may not have this problem in all rooms. I checked in and left the property with personal business and came back late at night; that's why I didn't want to go through all hassle and move to another room.Their breakfast buffet needs pork substitues like beef or chicken sausage/patties. Although they do have pork substitues listed in the menu| the buffet section had one container with bacon and sausages divided. I am not sure if those sausages were pork substitutes (beef or chicken) but keeping it in same container is a no go. The only reason I've picked this hotel is because it is close to JFK (only 3 miles away.) Before this place I had stayed at Mariott| which was even closer to JFK. I just wanted to try a new place thinking it might be a better experience considering it was a bit higher in price than Mariott. This was the time when higher price didn't mean better experience. At Mariott I didn't have any noise issues in my room and breakfast was better and complimentary. Whereas at Hilton breakfast is not complimentary.If you're lucky enough to get a room that doesn't have any noise problems and you don't care about breakfast because you are planning to have it somewhere else then this place is good overall. Property is clean and staff is friendly. I would rate my experience 3/5,Nov 15| 2019,3,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436

Everything is nice and clean| very comfortable beds and bedding| nice shampoo| body was| soap| and conditioner.

The hotel is nice enough. The staff was pleasant. It's well kept overall.

We were in room 408 and besides the super loud fan| the bathroom door is out of plumb and didn't want to shut. There were also a couple of tiles in the tub that were cracked.

The AC worked fine| but the loud fan noise was the worst!  I literally took a sound video to prove it to the front desk but we had no time to stop as we had to catch our next flight. No one slept! Worst experience ever-terrible start to our trip. The good news is that things can only get better. Booooooooo,Jun 6| 2019,1,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436

I only stayed here overnight due to a layover. I liked the convenience of having a free shuttle to the airport since my flight was very early in the morning. The hotel was very nice and quiet.

Food was expensive| but good. Pool was closed for renovations but not commincated,Jan 2| 2019,4,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436
It’s a decent airport hotel with a nice view of the airport from the bedroom. Staff were a bit slow in attending to our luggage with the result being that I had to stand outside for quite some time before a bellman attended us & being that it was New Years Eve| it wasn’t exactly warm. The receptionist was wonderful though & proficient & very kindly gave us a $30 voucher for dinner that night at the hotel restaurant as well as 2 vouchers for breakfast the next morning| which were not included in our booking. The rooms were pretty standard but nice & spacious compared to some others we have stayed in. AC in the room was probably the biggest issue in that it was very loud when it turned on & I think it’s safe to assume that the 2 sets of earplugs we found in the room were because of it. I don’t know if other rooms at this establishment are the same but Room 917 was very loud. We also had water leaking into the room on the windowsill which I did report to reception. My last comment on the negative side is that the bath water comes out of the taps quite brown. Overall though| it was still a pleasant experience for a quick| overnight hotel stay. Food & service in the restaurant was very good.,Jan 2| 2019,4,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436
Very quiet and easy access to JFK. I checked out around 4:30 and shuttle buss came quick.,Jan 1| 2019,4,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436
Free Shuttle to JFK was great. In the morning| it was good to see the drivers making the extra effort to get us to JFK by adding more buses when demand is too high.,Jan 1| 2019,5,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436
This was a truly miserable experience. I was told by the front desk that I would be getting second rate treatment since I booked through a third party. Despite being a Hilton Gold member| I was given a room on the third floor. I notice there were ear plugs on the night stand. I though this was related to it being an airport location. Still strange because we were a long way from the runways. It turns out the ear plugs were there because the heating system turned on with a noise level near a jet engine blast. The only way to avoid this was to turn off the heater. It was a very uncomfortable and restless night. This hotel should be imploded. I learned my lesson.,Jan 1| 2019,1,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436

Food was expensive| but good. Pool was closed for renovations but not commincated,Jan 2| 2019,4,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436
It’s a decent airport hotel with a nice view of the airport from the bedroom. Staff were a bit slow in attending to our luggage with the result being that I had to stand outside for quite some time before a bellman attended us & being that it was New Years Eve| it wasn’t exactly warm. The receptionist was wonderful though & proficient & very kindly gave us a $30 voucher for dinner that night at the hotel restaurant as well as 2 vouchers for breakfast the next morning| which were not included in our booking. The rooms were pretty standard but nice & spacious compared to some others we have stayed in. AC in the room was probably the biggest issue in that it was very loud when it turned on & I think it’s safe to assume that the 2 sets of earplugs we found in the room were because of it. I don’t know if other rooms at this establishment are the same but Room 917 was very loud. We also had water leaking into the room on the windowsill which I did report to reception. My last comment on the negative side is that the bath water comes out of the taps quite brown. Overall though| it was still a pleasant experience for a quick| overnight hotel stay. Food & service in the restaurant was very good.,Jan 2| 2019,4,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436
Very quiet and easy access to JFK. I checked out around 4:30 and shuttle buss came quick.,Jan 1| 2019,4,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436
Free Shuttle to JFK was great. In the morning| it was good to see the drivers making the extra effort to get us to JFK by adding more buses when demand is too high.,Jan 1| 2019,5,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436
This was a truly miserable experience. I was told by the front desk that I would be getting second rate treatment since I booked through a third party. Despite being a Hilton Gold member| I was given a room on the third floor. I notice there were ear plugs on the night stand. I though this was related to it being an airport location. Still strange because we were a long way from the runways. It turns out the ear plugs were there because the heating system turned on with a noise level near a jet engine blast. The only way to avoid this was to turn off the heater. It was a very uncomfortable and restless night. This hotel should be imploded. I learned my lesson.,Jan 1| 2019,1,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436

Looks nice| but oh| so many flaws. Guess again if you think parking in their lot is complimentary. It's valet only| at $25/night| and valet staff are total snots. Room service doesn't answer the phone| breakfast is $20/person| 20-somethings hold parties on the weekend and ruin the idea of a quiet drink in the bar (drunken rowdies sitting on the bar-top posing for Insta)| and worthless shuttle service. The heating & cooling fan in the room is so loud| it's like a jet taking off in the room. Not kidding. Their solution is to leave you ear plugs on the bedside stand. So 4 stars for appointment| 1 star for service| 1 star for amenities that should have been included in room charge (parking| breakfast) or functioning properly (HVAC).,Dec 3| 2018,2,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436

Decent| older hotel very close to JFK airport. But not too close that you hear the planes. Love having the airport shuttle. Not too far away from a subway (Jamaica Van Wyck station) but must uber/lyft to it as it's about 3-4 miles away. Hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. Hotel was clean| but can tell it needs a renovation soon. Beds are comfortable. Air conditioner is kinda loud| but works. Thankfully tho it didn't keep us up at night.,Oct 10| 2018,4,Hilton New York JFK Airport,144-02 135th Avenue| Jamaica| NY| 11436

My only concern is the sound of their air conditioning. It is loud! My husband suggested that it is as loud as the airplane jet in order to get you ready for a flight... Joking aside - isn’t it the point of the airport hotel to let people rest after exhausting travel?!
