I like the location of the hotel right by the bay.,Aug 19| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Upon arrival| the 2nd shift desk clerk was a jerk!He didn’t offer any bottled water. Didn’t tell us that we had to request housekeeping. Didn’t tell us anything! Only as we were leaving| we heard the desk clerk| (a different one)| explaining everything and had to ask her to repeat it for us.,Aug 18| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

The hotel was nice and all but parking was ridiculous. There was no parking after 9pm. I had to go to the front desk to ask where can I park cause there’s nothing open. Front desk told me another area I can park. Besides that..the hotel was perfect for our stay! It was quiet too!,Aug 17| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Room was great! Loved the view of our room! Will definitely be coming back here. If you’re looking to stay here make sure to book a bay view room. My wife & kids loved this hotel thanks again!,Aug 17| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Location right at the edge of bay WITH trails along the bay front.,Aug 16| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

Unfriendly staff. Lack of enough parking.,Aug 15| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Is not very clear the parking is not included,Aug 14| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Paid $36.00 parking but the regular parking lot was full and had to walk over to an unprotected "outside the roped area" where several homeless people were eying the vehicles not tomention the racoons (althugh cute) was all over the parking lot and around the overfilled trash can. Some racoons were jumping on the cars| too ! The hotel itself from the outsid and the lobby area was pretty clean but boy| the room smelled musty and very dirty| especially the bathroom where we made sure we didn't take our shoes off. Buffet was very poorly done with long long lines (over 30 people in line) and food was not up to par compared to all other Embassy suites we stayed at. Also| some people in line waiting for the food was not wearing there mask. Of all the embassy's we stayed (over 10 differnt ones- we will not stay at this one in the future.,Aug 12| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Excellent hotel in middle of busy SF. Great views. Nice trail to walk around and get your mind off of stress. Good food. Most of the people are mindful about cleanliness and masks and social distancing| little older furniture and glitchy TV but doesn’t matter in big picture.,Aug 12| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Amazing experience other than due to Covid the pool being closed,Aug 11| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Waterfront location like. Cafeteria style frozen food for breakfast. It use to be made to order. Noise from a/c unit and staff in early morning we were on 2nd floor facing street. Having to go get your own restock on coffee packets and not have housekeeping bring you. Parking watch out for another$36 anight. Wifi not free until you sign up for free membership rewards. Pool not available. What a downer. Use to love staying at embassy suites. Might as well have stayed at motel6 at least we knew what we'd be in for. Pandemic or no pandemic,Aug 7| 2021,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
I liked EVERYTHING.VERY FRIENDLY STAFFGOOD BREAKFAST THANK YOU!!!,Aug 7| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Pretty hotel. great view. Only draw back is Covid restrictions- no pool and stingy on providing extra towels.,Aug 6| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Disappointed that the pool was closed because this wasn’t mentioned on the website when booking. They were quick to replace our refrigerator when we realized it wasn’t working but disappointed that they don’t allow you to have extra pillows and the one each you do get is so flat I can’t honestly call it a pillow. There were 5 of us in a suite and we only had 2 sets of towels and when I called to get extra| no one answered the phone. Breakfast was ok but not as good as the full buffet that is normally served.This is normally our go-to hotel when visiting the SF area but this experience was disappointing.,Aug 3| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Next to the bay was unique. Shuttle service driver was very knowledgeable about the area.,Aug 2| 2021,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
It was a good stay| didn’t spend much time in the room| but when we need towels or other items  the housekeeping staff was very friendly and very helpful. We have stayed at this Embassy Suites about 5 times and we like the location.,Aug 2| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Our room smelled like cigarette smoke| and was warm all night despite having the a/c set low| my daughters legs and feet were black from crawling in the ground in room which is absolutely disgusting. Breakfast was horrible| and the pool was closed. The restaurant/bar was out of all beer on tap and had very few choices of bottled beer to choose from. Very disappointed in this trip. Everyone we encountered was very nice though. We have stayed here before and never had such an awful experience. The kids did however enjoy the koi fish.,Aug 1| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
I liked the breakfast that Embassy suites provides. What I did not like or what I did not notice is that when I arrived I was told that I would have to pay for parking and parking at the embassy suites in  milpitas  Didn't have a fee for parking. What I also thought was disturbing is that when I arrived at at 2:30 in the afternoon a room was not available or I should say the room they had placed me and was not available and it wasn't until another attendant said to put him in a different room that they finally did.. After driving in from Fresno my friend and I were tired and all we wanted to do was get into a room and relax.. But delayed in getting a room was not favorable.,Aug 1| 2021,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

Nice property| close to the waterfront. Spacious rooms - clean. Pool is unfortunately closed (until further notice) for not meeting city requirements. Breakfast options are limited| so is the restaurant (menu and opening hours).

The stay was just fine. What I’m upset about is the fact that it was not disclosed that the pool was closed and the reason I booked this hotel was because of the indoor pool| my kids were looking forward to the stay to enjoy and swim in the pool.

My stay overall was pleasant. I did have a bad aftertaste when I noticed a $72 charge in my c.c statement.  Come to find out it was for parking. It was not mentioned to me at the front desk.

Maybe it was in the fine print somewhere... so beware.,Jun 19| 2021,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

I like because Close to Airport And I didn’t like is there is no service| crappie brake fast and no house cleaning person| nothing working on the place | ask for cleaning room service | refrigerator was not working| air conditioning was not working. Never come back,Jun 15| 2021,1,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Over priced for bad customer service,Jun 15| 2021,1,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
We have a newborn and need a refrigerator to keep milk and other items he needs cold. When me and my wife got to the room the refrigerator was not working at all. I told the receptionist the problem and they had it fixed in less than 15 minutes. Amazing service and stay.,Jun 14| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
When we first checked in room 523 smelled of urine| we weren’t offered any assistance to move room up 3 floors with a toddler and four other children in tow. We weren’t even given enough water for our room. Our room was for six and we were only given 2 bottles of water. There were no extra pillows or blankets for the sofa bed. Breakfast  was horrible but the service from the cafeteria woman was the best service we got from anyone there at the embassy’s waterfront property.The location is so beautiful but it didn’t distract me from the callous and rude behavior of the front desk staff the manager did not offer any solutions for this horrible treatment of rectify it withThe staff. One of the staff members even called one of her fellow peers ‘stupid’ for giving me the wrong information. I can’t say I’ll ever come again to stay. The waterfront doesn’t need this eyesore named the embassy.,Jun 5| 2021,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
The hotel shows all amenities but has 0 amenities open. Very disappointed for the price I paid,Jun 4| 2021,1,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Refrigerator in room did not work,Jun 2| 2021,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Felt very safe (covid) on the property. Only one older gentleman was seen without a mask and clueless of social distancing in the food line. Maybe having masks available in an area that is congested would help. Otherwise all staff was friendly and helpful. Rooms were comfortable and the view of the bay was amazing. Would definitely stay there again.,Jun 2| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Nice setting and location| lovely atrium. Extra sitting area was useful. Balcony was NOT worth the upgrade| too small to even step out onto. Ocean view was nice but not great at low tide which was Extremely Low. Nice view of airport landings. Breakfast was decent| long lines. Only complaint was no hotel van service from airport operating currently due to Covid. Uber was almost $50 for 2 miles!,Jun 2| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

when i booked this hotel| they had a shuttle service to and from the airport. when we landed late at night| we found that there was NO shuttle| so we had to find a taxi. There was no option for food when we got to the hotel. The next morning we were looking for a good breakfast| but found that there was a line forty to fifty people in line. If i knew about the amenities that they stopped| i would have book somewhere else. I will not stay at this hotel again.,Jun 1| 2021,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

Upon check in| the place looked deserted. No one was at the front desk. After a few minutes a man came to assist us.  We told him we were celebrating our 30th Anniversary. We were suppose to stay two nights. He ask if we had a vehicle| we said yes. They charged 36. Extra a night to park your car. We went to the room the furniture was outdated dark and very uncomfortable. The T.V’s was from the 90’s. I looked out the window for the bay view and it was none. I called the front desk and ask if they could give us a bay view. He said that would be 40. Extra a night. We asked about the WiFi that was 10. Extra a night. We ask about the breakfast and reception hour. They said no reception hour. Breakfast is a box breakfast. This Embassy Suites needs to be down graded. It does not meet Embassy Suites standards. Plus their were raccoons running in the parking lot.,May 24| 2021,1,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

We stayed during covid| so we weren't able to enjoy the restaurant in the building| but it looked awesome. The court in this hotel is gorgeous.

There was a party at Room 318 on May 7th. It was horrible as I called reception starting 12:10am the another one at 1am since it didn’t stop. Staff poorly intervened during the first call.

Stay away from this hotel. Our stay was so bad. Their was no a/c and they gave us fan instead. We have to pay $36 for parking but parking is always full on site and they let us park on the street. I was disappointed with orbitz| i tried calling to make a complaint but no one is available to answer. I know we have a pandemic but i dont think what we experienced was right. Personally i feel we deserved a refund or atleast a discount. I'll be more careful booking with orbitz while we have a pandemic. I dont think they have enough human resources to help you out.

I have stayed at this hotel many times and I have always been received with great customer service except for this trip. Lucy at the front desk has horrible communication skills. The hotel should think twice before having this person at the front desk. She is rude!! Don’t think you want this as your first impression. The hotel was dirty. Never saw anyone vacuuming in hallways| which were very dirty. The wonderful breakfast spread that the hotel usually has| was much to be desired.  The quality that I am normally used to receiving from Embassy Suites was sadly missing.

The good. Cool location for families. This hotel is very pretty. It’s right by the water and the hotel itself looks like a steam punk building inside. Open metal and Glass decorated elevators| streams| fish and gardens in the middle. Our small and teenage children loved Walking through it. We saw raccoons in the parking lot... nice places to eat outside and walk around....the bad... don’t use too much toilet paper at all in the bathroom as the toilet will clog easily| so watch your kids with that one. The hotel did fix it as soon as we called them.  Also check the hotel space before you get cozy. We stayed in the living room when we arrived  and We discovered as we were going to bed| that probably the last guests pet peed on the rug near the bed because the floor smelled like pee. Our children were already falling asleep| so we let the hotel know in the morning. I don’t doubly they would have moved us had we requested it| but we were only passing through for the night. The manager on duty apologized and compensated us with a discounted room price .but we had to do a follow up with Hotels.com to get the compensation and I stayed on hold for 60 minutes to talk to someone... I let Hotels.com call me back on the next call| there was a lot of back and forth calling with the Hilton and Hotels.com to get our refund.all in all that was hastle after a long trip but| I would actually stay at this hotel again and just check EVERTHING in the room before settling in.,Apr 13| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Worst hotel stay ever! They advertise as "COVID compliant"  when we checked into our "sanitized" room I found pubic hair in the tub. Reported it to the front desk and I was told they did not have housekeeping on site and the only thing they could do is change my room. I changed rooms and the AC in the room was not working| we had to open the balcony door to keep the room fresh.  There is a sign in the room that states Housekeeping will only be done upon request. I called front desk at 9am and was told my request had to be in before 8:30am.  The next day I called at 7am and was told housekeeping would come by and only take out trash and take dirty towels. When I came back at 5pm it was not done. When I called front desk I was placed on hold for 20 minutes then they hung up on me. I called back and was told that because of "COVID" they do not do housekeeping during the stay.  I had to take my out trash out and the hey questioned me on the amount of towels I requested from the front desk.   Definitely do not recommend staying at this hotel.,Apr 12| 2021,1,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

I let Hotels.com call me back on the next call| there was a lot of back and forth calling with the Hilton and Hotels.com to get our refund.all in all that was hastle after a long trip but| I would actually stay at this hotel again and just check EVERTHING in the room before settling in.,Apr 13| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Worst hotel stay ever! They advertise as "COVID compliant"  when we checked into our "sanitized" room I found pubic hair in the tub. Reported it to the front desk and I was told they did not have housekeeping on site and the only thing they could do is change my room. I changed rooms and the AC in the room was not working| we had to open the balcony door to keep the room fresh.  There is a sign in the room that states Housekeeping will only be done upon request. I called front desk at 9am and was told my request had to be in before 8:30am.  The next day I called at 7am and was told housekeeping would come by and only take out trash and take dirty towels. When I came back at 5pm it was not done. When I called front desk I was placed on hold for 20 minutes then they hung up on me. I called back and was told that because of "COVID" they do not do housekeeping during the stay.  I had to take my out trash out and the hey questioned me on the amount of towels I requested from the front desk.   Definitely do not recommend staying at this hotel.,Apr 12| 2021,1,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
We stayed there because of the shuttle to airport and wasn’t given the service because of covid but weren’t told and still advertise it.The rooms need an urgent make over. The sofas are very old as well as the carpet,Apr 5| 2021,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Advertised on their website that they have airport shuttle| but they DO NOT. when this was brought to their attention| their response was you should have called. Maybe| but if it says on  different sites that you have free shuttle| I felt confident it didn’t require confirmation. So I guess call first. Also| pool and restaurant are not open!!,Apr 5| 2021,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

Good luck getting extra towels or extra blankets. The hotel is basically shut down minus the room you are staying at. Breakfast is not what it was like before| cold eggs| potatoes and suasages.

Our experience was not the best this time. We had stayed there before and the quality of the overall service and amenities offered were a lot better than this time. There was not enough parking no attendant to regular who was parked in there or not. They were people that staying in hotels they were parking there. When spoken to the front desk we were told to move cones and park in areas that were not safe. The conditions of the room was that it was not clean. The drapes had some kind of stain on them on the balcony it was dirty. We told the front desk and nothing was done about it. The property was disregarded the cleaning that was not there. The customer service was lacking. The whole place seems to run down and uncapped. They had one security young lady who was allowing people to come in with alcohol bottles in a lot of different parties were being held. Sanitizing stations we’re not filled. There was no water offered in the rooms even though water bottles are sealed. Seems to me like everything was an excuse because of Covid. In our opinion staff was doing the minimum for the overall customer experience. The parking fee is outrageous at $36 per night. As a guest this is entirely too much considering what is offered to us. Not everyone had a parking permit. And because of the shortage of parking spaces just let me know that not everyone was paying for parking which is unfair because only the register guest had to pay.We will definitely not be staying or spending 236 A NIGHT,Mar 26| 2021,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

Was very unsatisfied with the friendliness of the front desk staff. Called the front desk three times in same day to get housekeeping done| spoke to three different people first two said they would check on status of housekeeper. Third person to answer told me they do not provide housecleaning due to covid restrictions if staying more than one night. I asked why I wasn’t told the first two times I called and was rudely replied “well I’m telling you now we don’t provide housekeeping if staying more than one night.”The room heater/ac wouldn’t heat past 68. Room felt very cold. Both TVs in the rooms were very small compared to Embassy Suites in Milpitas so this was a huge bummer as I was unaware of different sizes for similar rooms. There were used towels left on the balcony when we arrived. Felt uncomfortable with cleanliness of room. Overall unsatisfied with the two night stay. I will say the staff offering morning breakfast was polite and patient. Appreciated their kindness and service.,Feb 16| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

The hotel is beautiful and right in front of the bay. The rooms are spacious and clean. The only complain I have was the suite was really warm. The temp of the suite was 78°F. When I called the front desk they said all rooms were in heat mode because they were expecting a cold night. However| I was not able to adjust the temperature of my suite which made it difficult to sleep.,Jan 12| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
I was there for a funeral which is never a good reason to travel. The first night I had a horrible time trying to find parking because their limited spaces were taken over by locals visiting the water front. 2nd night I didn’t fine parking at all and was force for park out side. They did wave the last night| but they charged me for the first night. The other issued I had was the rude front desk person when I complained about the problem and the huge party of 40 they allowed to check in without any covid restrictions| but my family couldn’t attend to my aunts funeral because of coved restrictions and guidelines.,Jan 11| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

Never again!,Jan 24| 2021,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
I had an absolutely horrible time from the time that I checked in to the time that I checked out the service was absolutely horrible and I will never stay at the Embassy suites Burlingame again. The front desk staff to the management staff was absolutely horrible,Jan 21| 2021,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

The hotel is beautiful and right in front of the bay. The rooms are spacious and clean. The only complain I have was the suite was really warm. The temp of the suite was 78°F. When I called the front desk they said all rooms were in heat mode because they were expecting a cold night. However| I was not able to adjust the temperature of my suite which made it difficult to sleep.,Jan 12| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
I was there for a funeral which is never a good reason to travel. The first night I had a horrible time trying to find parking because their limited spaces were taken over by locals visiting the water front. 2nd night I didn’t fine parking at all and was force for park out side. They did wave the last night| but they charged me for the first night. The other issued I had was the rude front desk person when I complained about the problem and the huge party of 40 they allowed to check in without any covid restrictions| but my family couldn’t attend to my aunts funeral because of coved restrictions and guidelines.,Jan 11| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

Right now the little shop isn’t open. If you need anything you will have to go somewhere else for supplies you forgot. The stay was stay| clean| enjoyable| and a great small getaway,Jan 28| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
I loved the vibe and the aesthetic of the interior of the hotel. The bay view was amazing too. Hotel rooms definitely need a remodel because they don't fit the aesthetic of the lobby and exterior. Parking should be free for guests| at least for one car.,Jan 26| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

Beds were small and uncomfortable| mostly annoyed by loud music and people| it was sooo loud that I’m sure the front had to have heard but yet I have to call at 1am to make it stop!!! Especially considering COVID-19!! Also annoyed at website book and paid online but when checking in found out no shuttle to airport after clearly stating there is shuttle online,Nov 30| 2020,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
No airport shuttle as advertized| breakfast was the same each morning| and the thermostate was controlled by the hotel. You could not make the room cooler.

That had not been cleaned at all| it still had food boxes left from the people before. Our final room was not cleaned very well either but we didnt want to move again. The beds were highly uncomfortable. The breakfast was terrible. $325 for 2 nights and it was definitely not worth that much.,Nov 22| 2020,1,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

This place was terrible. They charge me a $700 deposit and they don’t tell you anywhere on any app including hotel.com and their phone app they’re going to charge you $100 a day fee just to stay in the room and hold on your card which is crazy.Change the lightbulbs the first 10 minutes we were in that room| after a week stay the air conditioning didn’t work for five days. I asked them to can’t be an oceanfront room they refuse. They have a text deal when you have problems that you can text their number and they’ll answer your problems they ignored every single text I had. They were telling us we couldn’t get any clean linens and towels for seven days and they weren’t going to clean the room until I called corporate then I got the room cleaned every day. They don’t care about their customers it’s an old fashion worst embassy suite I’ve ever seen in my life. It’s so old they don’t even have plugs to charge your phones they are 10 miles away from anything and their shuttle wasn’t running so we had to walk a mile and a half to get to buses or spend a fortune on Uber every day. They don’t care about the people they only care about the dollar. The food was the same day after day.The people were very nice to serve the breakfast| but it gets all the same food every single day. This is $1 billion company and I would never stay there if they can’t be a room because they treated us like we didn’t exist. We asked for 2000 got one little cheap van with no legs.Do not go here,Oct 26| 2020,1,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

This day was lovely| I enjoyed myself even though there was smoke because we've been having fires in California so I really couldn't go outside but it was very spacious I should have told them that the air conditioner was leaking water a bit I forgot but everything else was fine The space was very big| the bathroom was lovely for what it was worth I swell the bathroom to meet their improvements but this place was more built for people who do business and work so it was a very entertaining m. Mike and council's work on their TV which is a plus they had a nice cafe but a block away the people were very nice and very helpful and all around it was a really nice place to be if you wanted to look at the view you could if you wanted to look at the ocean you could even from afar because I think every room had a balcony the inside of the core was beautiful like it was built into looking like a mall so it was lovely to be it. It was a quite relaxing trip and I really enjoyed it. They even had couches and work business-related tables and stuff they had a microwave which all rooms have a microwave a mini refrigerator so I definitely enjoyed staying there,Sep 15| 2020,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

I’m the policy it never stated That I had to pay $100 Deposit Fee per night up front I had 3 separate Bookings from Hotels.com. When I got there I got that surprise. Only thing they could do is give me a “free” parking that they charged. There was no toilet paper I had to go thru the front desk it would take up to an hr. I had also called ahead and they told me the pool was open when I got there it was Close. I asked for extra blankets to change mine and they said they only had sheets than later I see a person with Blankets. I was treated so poorly. I had a Big Group I would not recommend this hotel. It Honestly Ruined our Trip.,Sep 10| 2020,1,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Due to Covid-19| you expect delays.  But over an hour to check in because there was 1 person at the front desk. The room itself I felt was sufficiently clean.  Breakfast| another hour long line.  There needs to be changes made for the Pandemic but it's still new so I'm sure they're working on it.  Social distancing not really followed by others staying there.  But I guess they are avoiding confrontation.,Sep 10| 2020,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

Nice looking hotel and clean rooms.  Views of the bay are pretty.  Staff was overwhelmed and certainly let everyone know so.  Booked a suite for 2 adults and 3 kids and it was an absolute battle to get 5 total pillows for the room.  Other guests staying there were unruly| sounded like a daycare being run above our room.  Parking area didn’t prevent people that were not guests of the hotel from staying out.  Difficult to find a good safe parking spot at $35 a night.  Want to circle back around to the extremely rude concierge.  She argued with how many people I booked the room for in the fight for the 5th pillow.  When I went down later with proof of my reservation for 5| new concierge gave me 2 additional pillows and a towel no problem.,Sep 9| 2020,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

Mike and council's work on their TV which is a plus they had a nice cafe but a block away the people were very nice and very helpful and all around it was a really nice place to be if you wanted to look at the view you could if you wanted to look at the ocean you could even from afar because I think every room had a balcony the inside of the core was beautiful like it was built into looking like a mall so it was lovely to be it. It was a quite relaxing trip and I really enjoyed it. They even had couches and work business-related tables and stuff they had a microwave which all rooms have a microwave a mini refrigerator so I definitely enjoyed staying there,Sep 15| 2020,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

I’m the policy it never stated That I had to pay $100 Deposit Fee per night up front I had 3 separate Bookings from Hotels.com. When I got there I got that surprise. Only thing they could do is give me a “free” parking that they charged. There was no toilet paper I had to go thru the front desk it would take up to an hr. I had also called ahead and they told me the pool was open when I got there it was Close. I asked for extra blankets to change mine and they said they only had sheets than later I see a person with Blankets. I was treated so poorly. I had a Big Group I would not recommend this hotel. It Honestly Ruined our Trip.,Sep 10| 2020,1,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Due to Covid-19| you expect delays.  But over an hour to check in because there was 1 person at the front desk. The room itself I felt was sufficiently clean.  Breakfast| another hour long line.  There needs to be changes made for the Pandemic but it's still new so I'm sure they're working on it.  Social distancing not really followed by others staying there.  But I guess they are avoiding confrontation.,Sep 10| 2020,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

Nice looking hotel and clean rooms.  Views of the bay are pretty.  Staff was overwhelmed and certainly let everyone know so.  Booked a suite for 2 adults and 3 kids and it was an absolute battle to get 5 total pillows for the room.  Other guests staying there were unruly| sounded like a daycare being run above our room.  Parking area didn’t prevent people that were not guests of the hotel from staying out.  Difficult to find a good safe parking spot at $35 a night.  Want to circle back around to the extremely rude concierge.  She argued with how many people I booked the room for in the fight for the 5th pillow.  When I went down later with proof of my reservation for 5| new concierge gave me 2 additional pillows and a towel no problem.,Sep 9| 2020,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

I’ve stood here plenty of times great hotel! This time not so much only certain electrical outlets worked. The fridge went out we came back to hot birthday cake and veggies| we called to get another fridge the gentlemen working the front said there was nothing they could do but there’s ice machines all around and we could put our stuff on ice. My SO called front desk they moved us to a different room only to arrive in the room very hot the AC did not work the screen on the ac was blank very unfortunate experience as I really like this place. I’ll most likely stay here again I just thought they should know how things went and how the staff handled things very unprofessional.

Due to COVID things were not as good as they could be.  I requested our room be cleaned daily but that didn't happen.  They only cleaned our room once in our 3 day stay.  They did serve a breakfast consisting of scrambled eggs| sausages and breakfast potatoes.  Also coffee and juice and muffin or toast.  Had to eat in your room though.  Understandable with COVID.  The hotel is clean but could use some remodeling in the rooms.

Outside of the hotel is extremely pleasing on the eyes as long as you do not walk too far in either direction. For an airport hotel| it is extremely beautiful. The inside decor is breathtaking and wonderful. The front desk staff could not be friendlier and more helpful. The room itself was perfect for a business traveler such as myself.  The bathroom could have used a little updating but it was not a deal breaker. Unfortunately| there was a raging party at 1 am that after multiple phone calls to the front desk| did not die down.

Website does not communicate airport shuttle was suspended since March. Cab ride 30.00. Upon checking in no reception or cooked to order breakfast. No mention of this on website. If you cancel you forfeit your money. When I coveyed this to Marc after he texted me and asked how our stay was and I responded twice| no further response. His first response was due to covid19. My issue was lack of communication on website so that I could have made a better choice.

We had to switch rooms twice because they were unclean. All of their amenities offered on the web page were not available. They would not offer an upgrade or lower price for the false advertising. I always try to stay at Embassy for the value and atmosphere.  We made the decision to not to stay again. Bad management?,May 28| 2020,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Understanding of Covid pandemic that services were refused| but this hotel was horrible. Dirty dishes left in the hallway for days. Letter in room says they don’t service the room unless asked| if you ask they say they are not servicing the rooms.

I called and booked this room and they assured me that all amenities were going to be the same at this property. Got there and they weren’t ! Total rip off for the price! Breakfast was a banana stale muffin and a granola bar!   The entry way and elevator was filthy! Looked smelled like alcohol was spilled all over the floor. Elevator windows were filthy! This is a Hilton hotel?? Omg!? This place looked like skid row! Teens running around drinking drunk half dressed this is supposed to be a upper level hotel! NOT!

When we checked in| the room smelled of smoke. We went to the front desk and requested another room which we were given right away. The second room was ok| but was on the 9th floor. It’s warm on the 9th floor of the hotel| probably due to the atrium and glass ceiling. This hotel is in a really nice location| but it’s furnishings are getting old. It could use a little updating. The restaurant was very nice and the food was good and they serve a very nice breakfast in the atrium.,Feb 12| 2020,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

When we checked in| the room smelled of smoke. We went to the front desk and requested another room which we were given right away. The second room was ok| but was on the 9th floor. It’s warm on the 9th floor of the hotel| probably due to the atrium and glass ceiling. This hotel is in a really nice location| but it’s furnishings are getting old. It could use a little updating. The restaurant was very nice and the food was good and they serve a very nice breakfast in the atrium.,Feb 12| 2020,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

This place has really gone downhill!! First off they started charging $35 for parking a night? Why?  The first night the sofa couch mattress felt like a mattress with springs so uncomfortable!  The next day I attempted to get a hold of the mgr several times.  Never return my calls left on the phone or when given to him by the employees.  Got back to the hotel the supervisor comes out with a total attitude.  He switched our room to a double bed.  The air did not work and the window did not close which helped since it felt like a sauna because it was so hot!  Again the mattress on the couch was horrible my BF threw the couch pillows on top so he could sleep on top of that instead on the bed of springs!  Never coming back! I should of picked the Four Point Sheraton in South City which I had been doing,Jan 23| 2020,1,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

The view was great| staff was friendly. Rooms are large but the bathrooms  are small.  Noticed many people smoking off their balconies when we entered. Sure enough| our room smelled like smoke. It wasn’t horrible but you could tell it used to be a smoking room at some point. Bed was decent| plenty of parking.,Jan 21| 2020,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

A family of six| we were given a room that for not have heat and we were all extremely cold the first night until we switched rooms the next day (beware all corner rooms apparently do not have heat according to the staff).

The A/C didn’t work and they had to bring up a fan to cool down the room. The facility is nice but they are very understaffed. I felt bad for the employees who had to deal with all of the guests needs with such a limited staff. People from the front desk were running up supplies to the rooms because they just didn’t have enough housekeeping staff. All staff were very friendly and accommodating they just didn’t have enough people working so things just didn’t get done. There was still confetti all over the hotel on Jan 2nd which means the floors hasn’t been cleaned or vacuumed in two days.,Jan 5| 2020,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Well we ended up in the back of the building yet again| and the enerator kept me up in the morning I was also under some loud patrons as well as in the side of me| from jumping beds over me to blasting musuc on the side to the generator making so much noise I couldn't get the needed full sleep I sought for this relaxing family trip. It was also extremely loud inside of the pool the kids wouldn't stop screaming I eventually gave up because It gave me a headache I understand all kids are loud but when 20 kids scream i side an enclosed pool area its not pretty. The snacks were a bust it got me sick not sure if it was old ranch dressing| and there was no geradibe and sprite to make shirley temples as well as the new bartender had no idea what he was doing and made a disgusting drink for me so I tossed it. The breakfast didn't offer the pancakes only french toast and not everybody eats egg| as well as they never do turkey bacon only berf or pork sausage and bacon| there was no milk for the cereal| no bagels or toast for the philly cheese| it wasn't the nice breakfast we are used to when we visit. This doesn't mean we won't return it just wasn't the right time to be there I guess because thiet soda machine was broken no geradine for our drink no maitai or girly fruity drinks at the bar| a lack of supervision in the poolto keep it from getting chaotic to the noise level in our room from other patrons being too much for me to enjoy my stay.

Overall the Embassy is great; I stay here if possible whenever I'm in the Burlingame area.  The amenities are all awesome| service wonderful| rooms well kept| etc.  My only complaint is that there were NO usb outlets in the room.  Usually there's at least one outlet that is USB| either on the nightstand (usually part of the lamp) or at the desk area (since you're likely to have your computer here).  This room had none.  Not a single one.  Luckily the other hotel where the event I was attending was being held had free charging stations available.  Normally I have no complaints whatsoever| but a premium suite with an office area should| at this day and age| have an outlet ready to go for USB devices.,Dec 8| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

Great location but very annoyed to be charged $32 per night for parking and find out when you are leaving.  NO INDICATION OF THIS CHARGE| they asked if you had a car and gave me a pass to put on the car in a wide open parking area with NO COVERED CAR PARK or anything to indicate you were to be charged.,Dec 2| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

Checking out the lady didn’t even look up | asked for rm# handed me the bill and kept looking at the computer . I don’t do reviews | we all have good days bad days| and not everything is perfect .. but these guys | a whole another level of unprofessional “ I HAVE NO INTEREST OF HELPING YOU ! The night manager even told us if  we are not happy with the room we can go and find somewhere cheeper and maybe with a view ... again | maybe just a wrong day to be checking in with the wrong people | but i paid for my stay | i did not book for free so to take what ever is given to me !,Dec 2| 2019,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

Overall the Embassy is great; I stay here if possible whenever I'm in the Burlingame area.  The amenities are all awesome| service wonderful| rooms well kept| etc.  My only complaint is that there were NO usb outlets in the room.  Usually there's at least one outlet that is USB| either on the nightstand (usually part of the lamp) or at the desk area (since you're likely to have your computer here).  This room had none.  Not a single one.  Luckily the other hotel where the event I was attending was being held had free charging stations available.  Normally I have no complaints whatsoever| but a premium suite with an office area should| at this day and age| have an outlet ready to go for USB devices.,Dec 8| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

When I checked in I found the refrigerator was not cold. That was replaced promptly. Later I noticed that the HVAC was not heating the room. I turned up the thermostat to the max 80deg and found that it never responded and continued to blow cold air. I reported this to the front dest and they gave me 2 choices for a time for the staff to inspect. I left the room and when I returned later the room was still cold. I was very annoyed but since I had already reported the problem I dressed warm for the rest of my stay. During the day I turned off the HVAC as it was warmer with it off due to the sun radiating through the sliding glass door. The bath tub looked like it had been chipped and repaired several times and in fact while in use some of the repaired coating came off in chunks. Since I only used the shower this wasn't an issue other than visual for me| however I'm sure that some picky guest will hammer you on that. Checking Yelp reviews| it appears as though the HVAC system has multiple and ongoing issues that really should be resolved. I expect better from Hilton.,Nov 26| 2019,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

Overall| the staff was kind and respectful. However| on my last day there| the driver of the shuttle to the airport was uncaring and rude. My arm is currently in a sling and I was visibly struggling to get my luggage together upon his announcement. He kept looking at me| waiting while I was struggling. I finally asked for his assistance and he seemed annoyed and the only thing he said to me was “NO FOOD OR DRINK! YOU CANNOT COME ON SHUTTLE!” I said “okay| and finished everything for as quickly as possible and when I turned around| he was in the shuttle just waiting for me.,Nov 18| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

Great location right on the water. Beautiful views! I picked a bay front room and it was loud at times from planes landing and taking off. Check in and check out was quick and hassle free. Breakfast was delicious! Loved the made to order omelet and breakfast buffet. The room was cold and was told they had central heating. They offered a space heater but it never came.

When we checked in we were told  we had rooms next to each other. I confirmed one had disabled facilities and was told the one room was now not ready and to return after 20 minutes.We went to our room on the 8th floor with an excellent view but assured our dauughter that hers would be exactly the same next doorOn returning after 20 minutes we were allocated a room on the 4th floor the other end of the hotelBecause she had not read the reservation properly she built up our hopes of a perfect visit to yhis hotel,Oct 7| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

This was a last minute reservation 15hrs ahead of check in and to be frank I got an awesome deal for all the facilities they provided. Pet friendly and awesome setting| surroundings and neighbourhood. Only request I have to the hotel is keep up the good work but people coming in with pets will be happy to have their rooms on the main or the next one up for easy access to go outside and do their job. A good majority of the pets do not see lift on a day to day basis and they would be frightened to death with close surroundings.,Aug 13| 2019,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

I like that this hotel is actually on the bay. Great pathways to walk. However| the pathways at night are not well lit| so it’s not really safe to walk or stroll.,Aug 13| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

This was a last minute reservation 15hrs ahead of check in and to be frank I got an awesome deal for all the facilities they provided. Pet friendly and awesome setting| surroundings and neighbourhood. Only request I have to the hotel is keep up the good work but people coming in with pets will be happy to have their rooms on the main or the next one up for easy access to go outside and do their job. A good majority of the pets do not see lift on a day to day basis and they would be frightened to death with close surroundings.,Aug 13| 2019,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

I was not given option to choose a room. The room provided has balcony but it’s covered with tall trees. The smell of the room is terrible maybe because the carpet is wet from the previous guests who used the swimming pool. The bathroom tub is clogged and dirty. The coffee maker is broken and the replacement was not provided even after I requested.  Almost all staff don’t smile and looked overworked. The hotel has an event that sells shoes inside the hotel rooms in different floors. It looks like a market and privacy is compromised. I questioned my final bill because I was charged of WiFi which supposed to be free. No one helps with the luggage.

We enjoyed our stay here. Our room was really spacious and very clean. There location is perfect. We are only (very) disappointed about the self parking charge| which is $32/night.

We chose this hotel because there was an event at the hotel and wanted to enjoy without worrying about driving back home...and thought a 1-night "staycation" would be a nice break.  We were early for check-in and they had a room available. (Awesome! But that was it.) The suite had a funky odor throughout as if the mini-fridge had rotten food in it.  We called down for extra towels and pillows two separate instances. Both times nothing showed up for over 1.5 hours! At 1130pm| finally went to the front desk for a face-to-face...still took 30 mins to get towels and another 10 mins more for pillows.  The tv kept freezing every 10-15 mins.  No reason to call to report an issue with the tv/cable if they cannot even deliver towels in a reasonable amount of time.  Big suite & nice view if you like watching planes land at the airport. Small| cheap pillows & suite needs to be renovated (really)!  If you want decent customer service or a relaxing "getaway" for a night or more| this is probably NOT the best choice...especially since this area has lots of other choices!

The room was exquisite.  The service from the front desk was friendly but felt hurried.  The lady at the souvenir shop was EXTREMELY rude.  Please hire someone with a friendlier disposition.  It is a bit far from the action in San Francisco (around a $60 Uber ride) but it is so peaceful and if you like seeing plane land and take off| it is a dream come true.,Jul 8| 2019,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

It was NOT worth the amount of money spent and would not consider returning to this location again.,Jul 9| 2019,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

The room was exquisite.  The service from the front desk was friendly but felt hurried.  The lady at the souvenir shop was EXTREMELY rude.  Please hire someone with a friendlier disposition.  It is a bit far from the action in San Francisco (around a $60 Uber ride) but it is so peaceful and if you like seeing plane land and take off| it is a dream come true.,Jul 8| 2019,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

Great hotel| wonderful staff| with a great view. Only issue was that the stucco above one of the beds was chipping| not enough coffee| no stirrers| beds were small for 2 people| but besides that everything else was nice.,Jul 7| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

Price was awesome but service & room was not great. I received a crib for my infant only to come out broken| didn't bother to change. Lights did not work| no ventilation in queen bed room. Did not bring pillows as requested & also charged extra on who knows what at the end of our stay. Knowing it was part Hilton was disappointing because we have never experienced such lack on so many things felt like we were at a cheap  motel honestly.,Jul 1| 2019,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
The tv in a $500 a night suite didn’t work & couldn’t be fixed. The walls were banged up. A large group of teenagers were not well-behaved even though they they adult chaperones.

It was last minute and everywhere else was booked. First night we found a lot of hair in our bed sheets. Old worn out bed. Ironing board was broke. They didn’t bring another til the next day. Asked for a late checkout. Without any introduction someone called our room back and asked “Are you leaving?” With a attitude.

Really disappointed in our 'Bay View'. I guess if that means getting to look out a filthy window to a cigarette butt-covered rooftop and a sliver of the bay| then that was on point. Would have gone for a less-expensive option if I knew that's what I was paying for but we really wanted to take advantage of the location and view! Couldn't call down to the front desk to check why our TV kept going out as the phone in the living room didn't work. We used the other in the room and were told they weren't sure| try turning it off. Also disappointed no wifi unless you're a Hamptons Member| $250+/night for a room isn't enough for wifi AND a room.  Unfortunate about some of the hiccups because we had great service and food from Gabriel in the restaurant| enjoyed the cocktail hour and breakfast and really liked the surrounding area. Great walking paths| pretty area| quick to airport service.,Jun 27| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

We had a good stay The staff was amazing and helped us as much as they could. They were super friendly. A few issues we had were the first room The floor was wet when we got there at 1am and still wet when we got up. They did give us a new room which was supposed to be bay view but it was on the second floor and overlooked a roof with a ton of cigarette butts just outside our window. It was super gross. The tub didn’t drain either but they came and fixed it for us.  Otherwise the room was great we just kept the blinds closed. The breakfast was amazing. All on all it was a great stay.

The coffee machine did not work and needed to be replaced. My room window was stuck open| and required maintenance to come fix it.The pull out sofa bed was so bad that I woke up the next morning with a massive neck and back ache.The location is excellent. Wonderful views of the Bay and the San Francisco International Airport. The staff are amazing and their service is really good.This is NOT the Embassy Suite comfort that I'm used to.

We were downgraded from guaranteed bay view to “lagoon” view. The lagoon looked oddly like a parking lot. $40 was taken off of our stay but we wouldn’t have booked or been willing to pay that much if our hands weren’t tied (it was late and we were already there| we weren’t up for looking for somewhere else to stay.) Our room was run-down with a number of broken or not working items| including the shower. The fold out couch was horrible- without any hyperbole the worst I’ve ever felt. The “mattress” was comically thin. The pool was packed with kids jumping onto each other| various speakers blasting music| and people drinking beer in the hot tub. There were no towels or anyone enforcing any of the posted rules. I had to pull my kids out of the water out of safety concerns. We will not be returning. I’ve stayed at a number of wonderful| less expensive places in the area and will be giving them my business again.,Apr 23| 2019,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

The hotel is great and the staff very friendly. Loved the reception and the breakfast buffet. Tried the restaurant in the hotel and the fresh made food and view to the bay as your dining is fabolous. The room very cleaned and accomodating. Do wish we received some spanish channels options on the tv. The swimming pool was nice| however very full with the kids clubs on site. For families or adults| I would recommend to have the camps come within a set schedule rather than all at once with the rest of the hotel guest.,Apr 7| 2019,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

This is my second time staying here and the towel situation is not getting any better. We had four adults in our room along with two children and were only left three bath towels| when I requested an additional four towels I was only brought up three. Overall the stay was good the free breakfast was a delight| from the staff to the seating I enjoyed that perk.,Apr 8| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
I love this hotel. I love the buffet breakfast included.It’s very accommodating. Relaxing too. The rooms are clean and comfortable. I can’t wait to book again and thank you Expedia added my points.😀I definitely recommend it to everyone.,Apr 7| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
The hotel is great and the staff very friendly. Loved the reception and the breakfast buffet. Tried the restaurant in the hotel and the fresh made food and view to the bay as your dining is fabolous. The room very cleaned and accomodating. Do wish we received some spanish channels options on the tv. The swimming pool was nice| however very full with the kids clubs on site. For families or adults| I would recommend to have the camps come within a set schedule rather than all at once with the rest of the hotel guest.,Apr 7| 2019,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

Since when do hotel charge you to check in early??  I attempted to check in at 1 PM and was told| "your room is available".  Great news!!  This was followed by "but it will cost you $50 to check in now--check in time is 4PM.  What poor customer relations.  It would not cost the hotel anything to let me check in 3 hours early--but it certainly has cost them my respect by trying to charge me for this privilege.

I did the reservation with a king bed| the receptionist blame Expedia for offering a room that was not supposed to be offer and change us to a double queen bed room| $29.00 for parking? When I said whaaat??? Clerk answered “this is the bay area” so I told him well since you are changing us to a different room than the one we were promise| shouldn’t you wave the parking fees| just to keep us happy? His answer “I’m giving you a deal| the room I’m giving you now has bay view| and usually this room is more expensive| you should consider yourself lucky” “LUCKY” really?? We were not looking for a room with a view that at the end it was at the corner and the great view he mentioned was to the street and you had to go out of the room to the balcon to see the bay| they though they were doing me a favor| just because we were tired| we stayed otherwise we would cancel and go to a different more costumer oriented place| I dont recommend this place| at least until they fix their problem with the employees attitude.,Jan 7| 2019,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Very nice hotel with nice view. Complimentary breakfast was great with a great variety of hot and cold food. Made to cook omelettes were great. Evening happy hour is awesome. Great drinks| great bartenders| good healthy snacks to accompany. Nice heated pool for this winter weather which the kids really enjoyed. Air conditioner not really working| as it is already controlled for the whole hotel. Room did get a bit warm at times| only option was to open sliding door. A little hesitant to do so with small kids| and on the 9th floor. Mattress on sofa couch needs to get updated. Seemed old| uncomfortable| could feel the coils at time. Other than that| front staff was friendly and polite. I like that there was plenty of room to sit for breakfast and happy hour. Lobby is spacious and clean.,Jan 6| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

The rooms stay rather warm (we like it colder to sleep). If you like to sleep with a box fan on for the noise the bathroom exhaust fan works perfect. The pillows are kind of crappy (no firmness at all). The only major complaint we had was the amount of trash/room service dishes that litter the halls. The trash is set out from peoples rooms and it felt like we were constantly seeing it or staff would take forever to pick up the halls. Overall though it was a great hotel stay and we couldn’t complain about anything.,Jan 5| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

The staff lie to us and over charged us when we didn’t want the service that was the worse experience my family and I have ever had in a hotel never again will we stay there never the service was so bad that we are going to file a complaint on the hotel staff.,Jan 5| 2019,1,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

The location of this hotel and the convenience of it’s airport shuttle make it a perfect place to stay.  The free breakfast options are incredible....will even cook you a make-to-order omelet.  Of course the free happy hour is a plus!,Jan 7| 2019,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
I did the reservation with a king bed| the receptionist blame Expedia for offering a room that was not supposed to be offer and change us to a double queen bed room| $29.00 for parking? When I said whaaat??? Clerk answered “this is the bay area” so I told him well since you are changing us to a different room than the one we were promise| shouldn’t you wave the parking fees| just to keep us happy? His answer “I’m giving you a deal| the room I’m giving you now has bay view| and usually this room is more expensive| you should consider yourself lucky” “LUCKY” really?? We were not looking for a room with a view that at the end it was at the corner and the great view he mentioned was to the street and you had to go out of the room to the balcon to see the bay| they though they were doing me a favor| just because we were tired| we stayed otherwise we would cancel and go to a different more costumer oriented place| I dont recommend this place| at least until they fix their problem with the employees attitude.,Jan 7| 2019,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Very nice hotel with nice view. Complimentary breakfast was great with a great variety of hot and cold food. Made to cook omelettes were great. Evening happy hour is awesome. Great drinks| great bartenders| good healthy snacks to accompany. Nice heated pool for this winter weather which the kids really enjoyed. Air conditioner not really working| as it is already controlled for the whole hotel. Room did get a bit warm at times| only option was to open sliding door. A little hesitant to do so with small kids| and on the 9th floor. Mattress on sofa couch needs to get updated. Seemed old| uncomfortable| could feel the coils at time. Other than that| front staff was friendly and polite. I like that there was plenty of room to sit for breakfast and happy hour. Lobby is spacious and clean.,Jan 6| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

The rooms were much smaller than we thought based on the photos on the website.  There were some cracks and stains on the walls in our room and we had some issues with the heating. We were upset that there were no roll away beds as we were 5 people.  This should be on the website somewhere so it’s not a shock when you arrive.

We love the location and enjoy the view of the airport and the bay. The room was spacious and no adjoining door which was wonderful. The fact that there were so many children there was a problem as they liked to play on the walkways outside the rooms.

This is our second time staying here| 2 years apart. Has been good both times. I love the breakfast spread and the staff is very friendly. We arrives before 10am and they sent us straight up to a prepared room ($50 for early checkin-worth it with small jetlagged children). Comfy bed and a pull out couch| cribs available (just put a blanket in the bottom since a bit hard-all good then). We have an evening flight and they even pushed back our checkout time to accomodate our tired kiddos. I love the staff here as they always have a smile. Its a great place for kids too due to the fish ponds and swimming pool. Would gladly use this spot again when transiting in SFO.,Dec 18| 2018,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

Called the front desk all that I was told is it was being taken care of and that I could call tomorrow and speak to a manager! So basically so what if everyone else who paid a pretty penny for a beautiful room that you THOUGHT you were going to be able to get rest before an early morning flight...

While we loved the room configuration| we found that the room needed some maintenance.  The fire alarm had been removed from the sleeping area and the faucet in the bathroom wiggled enough that we were afraid it would fall off.

When our room was cleaned| we also did not receive clean bath towels.  It took 2 calls to get this resolved.  We gave the front desk a list of the issues and they gave us some Hilton Reward points.

We reserved a premium room for two nights at this location.  our room was not cleaned.  we came to our room at around 10 pm and notified the front desk and they were apologetic and they will make a note of the incident. We requested towels for our party of four | 2 adults & 2 kids.  Since no towels were delivered after 45 minutes after my initial call we called again.  Front desk said they will send the towels right away but the towels never arrived that night.  Next morning my wife asked one of the maids and we got our towels but nothing else.  At the time of departure front desk denied that they had any notes from previous night and cleaning service said we must have left the Do Not Disturb sign on the door which is an absolute lie.  We travel a lot all around the world and we know better.  Front desk was not apologetic and did not offer any compensation for their mistake.

The hotel is basically not bad in both location and cleanliness!  However| the staff is not so good in compare with other hotels at the same level as they seems to be not so friendly and polite!  Not sure whether it is too busy or what!   Also| the food being provided for breakfast is below standard as most of the food have been overcooked!   The staff at the Front Desk are the best in compare with other staff such as the house-keeping or waiter/waitress in the restaurant!   The Complimentary Evening Reception is a Good Point but have a little bit more varieties will be even better!,Oct 18| 2018,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

The air did not work when we got here.  The floor was wet in front of the fridge.  They put a $50 deposit on my card but never said anything about it.

The hotel was having some work done on the roof and the lift the workers were using was extremely loud and started at 7:30 am and went all morning. When checking out there was nobody here and had to wait about 7 minutes for someone to come and check me out.  When I asked the front desk what was going on with all of the noise they acted as if they didn't know what I was talking about.

The hotel is unique old hotel with character but well maintained. The location by the waterfront is superb..it's heaven for plane spotter like us.

My room and entire building's A/C was non funtional. Room was hot. Gave me fan for for $240 room rental. Unacceptable! Then front desk person denied the system was broken. He said the system was in the "neutral",Sep 21| 2018,1,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
The hotel is unique old hotel with character but well maintained. The location by the waterfront is superb..it's heaven for plane spotter like us.  The only thing the hotel should consider is change the TVs. They are old tvs probably 10 years old. We loved the breakfast and afternoon drink complimentary. We really enjoyed it.,Sep 18| 2018,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Nice location| great views and the rooms are huge! The staff was friendly and they even let us check in early. Breakfast is included and they had plenty of options. Wonderful experience!,Sep 18| 2018,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

Expensive for what you get| but that seems to be the norm around Sam Francisco. Front desk staff: some great| some mediocre and not particularly interested in being helpful. The air conditioning had two settings: freezing cold| and off. Wouldn't heat the room. Beds a bit old and not especially comfortable.,Sep 17| 2018,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Beds were uncomfortable|couldn’t adjust the temperature in the room|room service didn’t pick up the phone,Sep 10| 2018,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Checkin process could improve. Slow checkin and then they gave me wrong room type. I had to go stand in line a second time to get it right. Property is great,Sep 10| 2018,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
My husband and I enjoyed our one night stay in this hotel. The room is spacious and clean| although the decor is looking a bit tired. The comfortable bed alllowed us to have a good night's sleep| which was much needed after a 10 hours flight from the UK. Breakfast was good| I enjoyed the made to order vegetarian omelette| which was very fresh and tasty. The location of the hotel by the waterfront and next to a small lake is fabulous. On the morning before we checked out| we went for a long walk around the lake and by the waterfront| taking in the beautiful scenery. We would have loved to stay longer| would certainly return in the future and would definitely recommend this hotel.,Sep 10| 2018,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

I liked the service of the ladies behind the omellet counter.... I DID NOT like that Embassy does not let you have the option of putting on the heat unless it is below 55... which it did reach...  I had a cold and hated the fact that I had to call room service to get a small portable heater. So thee room was never warm when you first came in| you would have to wait till the little heater warmed up... i guess at least they offered a little heater.,Sep 8| 2018,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
Worst pillows ever had and really upset about have to pay extra $29 each night for parking on same hotel building without any previous notice until I check in and if I don’t like the situation to cancel my reservation have to pay cancel fee| also needs attention for more variation of food and more staff helping plus more table w chairs,Sep 8| 2018,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

We had an early Saturday morning flight and were disapplointed by the lack of food availability before 7:30am| even for an additional cost. They offer a free breakfast starting at 6am during the week| but only starting at 7:30 weekends. There is no AM room service| coffee stand| or convenience store availability before this time. Also| we wish the gym could have been available 24/7 so we could have exercised before our flight. It doesnt open until 6am. One of the elevators was broken| so it was a bit of a wait at times| especially since it was too small to fit multiple families. As a result| we had to wait for it to come up/go down a couple times (as a family of 5)| especially if people had luggage with them. The area by the pool was slippery. It is adjacent to the lobby| so someone threw down a pile of towels on the ground on the lobby side of the entrance to "wipe it up".  The room was nice| though.,Sep 2| 2018,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

Location was great. Our room was hotter than outside....air wouldn’t work. Went to front desk and was told “open the sliding door to cool it off”. So for 4 days and nights....we had our balcony door open....all night just so we didn’t sweat in our sleep. Being right beside the airport we got to listen to EVERY plane land and take all ALL night.

Nice property for an overnight stay before a flight out of SFO.

Loved the breakfast and free happy hour complimentaries. This hotel holds up the Hilton name and needs to live up to it. I stayed Thursday night-Sunday morning with another adult and three children. Although I complained on Friday night about the a/c not working in my room and the tub water not going down properly to the pleasant lady at the front counter it seemed like she made notes of it and that was going to be taken care of it. A few minutes later we received one fan. Sorry but one fan for five people wasn't going to cut it. We were too busy on this trip to stop at the counter to complain again but at the end of this trip I mentioned to the front clerk at check out how disappointed I was with the room. The clerk just said I'll make a note of it. Again I have a long ride home and didn't have time to argue or speak to a manager but I at least wanted some discount or at least an apology. I'm disappointed.,Aug 20| 2018,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
One of the nicest hotels I ever stayed in. Each room was a 2 room suite with two TVs. Free Quality breakfast in the hotel atrium they also offered a free afternoon snack and drink every afternoon. The Hotel sits right on San Francisco Bay overlooking the bay and airport in a distance. The Atrium is beautiful and the service was great.

Great hotel.  Just beware of the $30 a night parking. Seems like another way to bleed your customers out of another dollar. Make your parking affordable.,Aug 19| 2018,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

Visst| det är Covidtider men detta hotell hade gett upp och ställt in det mesta under förklaringen att det är pandemi. Shuttle till flygplatsen var inställd och vi hänvisades till Uber (som om det vore bättre och säkrare). När jag ifrågasatte det vid incheckningen och varför detta inte informerades på deras helsida så fick jag svaret att jag kunde byta hotell om det inte passade från en otrevlig medarbetare (vilket är svårt 20:00 när man har två barn med sig). Poolen var stängd (stod inte heller på hemsidan) och frukosten inte alls bra. Rent och rymligt rum dock för familjeresan. Nästa gång så väljer jag Doubletree eller Hyatt.,Apr 10| 2021,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

立地も空港のそばで、飛行機も見えるし、朝食もオムレツを作ってくれるし、部屋に電子レンジもついててよかった。ただ、ベッドの横の引き出しの中に、いつのものかわからないお菓子の食べカスが入っていたり、きれいにされているはずのビニールがかかったコップが、汚れていたりしていました。,Dec 3| 2018,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010

ベッド2台とソファーベッド1台の部屋に5泊しました。なるべく高層階、(出来れば海側)のリクエストをしたが、エントランス上の2階でした。変更は出来たが結構な料金upだったので諦めた。建物内中央には屋根のある吹き抜けの中庭があって広々としており、そこで朝食が取れる。部屋も広く、水廻りほか特に困ることはなかった。(照明は少し暗め)  空港とホテル間は近隣のホテルを巡回している無料のシャトルバスが20分おきくらいに出ている。(運行時間4時〜午前0時) 空港到着時にホテルに連絡すると乗り場を教えてくれる (英語)   また、ホテルと最寄りの駅までが遠く、歩くと20分くらいかかる。バーリンゲーム方面への無料のシャトルバスもあるがブロードウェイステーションは休日などは通過するので注意。一つ先のバーリンゲームステーションは必ず停まる。,Sep 27| 2018,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport Waterfront,150 Anza Blvd| Burlingame| CA| 94010
