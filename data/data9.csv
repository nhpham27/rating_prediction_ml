Very dirty| bathroom was smelly| shower was horrible| way to loud at night. No valley parking,Aug 17| 2021,1,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001
The hotel is clean and the front desk staff were pleasant. The employee at the rooftop bar was rather rude to us but another person noticed and tried to apologize on his behalf. Would not recommend it.  The air conditioner in the room could not keep up and would not cool less than 76 degrees. They could not give us ice and the room did not even come with cups or a fridge. Instead we had a vending machine in our room that was empty. We even asked for water and they basically told us to go down the street to get water from a local store. We understand some things are necessary to help stop the spread of COVID but not even being able to sell water bottles? The shower door in our small room opened in so you have to get sprayed in the face and soak the bathroom floor in order to turn it on.,Aug 17| 2021,3,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001
Location| friendliness of staff,Aug 16| 2021,5,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001
Great customer service from the morning to afternoon staffs but not so much from the night crew. Air quality of the room is so bad my eyes and throat started hurting every night. Really should consider using air purifier or clean the a/c.,Aug 16| 2021,3,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001
Overall it was nice stay. Personnel was friendly. Room was clean and comfortable. Good location if you planning to spend time in Chelsea or Fashion district.,Aug 15| 2021,5,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001

The AC in our room was not functioning or cooling. We called to see if it can be repaired. It didn’t really do anything. Next day I called again and they provided us a fan.,Aug 14| 2021,3,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001

Hotel is very unremarkable. Room is fine.  Bathroom is fine. Front desk staff a bit on the “sassy” side. Wouldn’t make a point to stay here again.

We had a generally pleasant 4-night stay at this conveniently located (just off 7th Ave. near the subway and a few blocks from Penn Station) hotel in my favorite town.  We were out most of the day and pleased to rest in a comfortable bed in a cool room. Due to pandemic regulations| there was no ice available and room cleaning was only every 3 days.  We put out our garbage outside the door which was collected daily.  The room was very compact (NY size) and the bathroom was serviceable| but needs more hooks to hang towels.  Note that there's also no fridge and not all the elevators were in service.  There's also construction going on| as the front of the hotel was protected by scaffolding.  Reception was friendly and any requests for towels| etc. were delivered promptly.  After checkout| it was so convenient to be able to leave our suitcases at the front desk for a bit.,Jul 7| 2021,4,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001

The most disappointing Hilton we have ever stayed at. They didn't clean the room the entire time we were there!! 4 days with no clean sheets or towels!! No ice machine! We had to walk a couple blocks for ice. The included breakfast was not available and they did not compensate for this. The room was much smaller than the pictures online. No microwave| no fridge and the in room bar was empty. They only good part of the room was the shower. Overall this was a terrible room and I would look elsewhere for a hotel.,Jun 29| 2021,1,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001

Our experience with this hotel was very very disappointing. Especially for a Hilton. The room was not cleaned one time during our 4 night stay. Not once! We even asked for it to be cleaned including fresh sheets but they never came. The air conditioning was not very good. The room was very small compared to the pictures online. No refrigerator| no ice machine| no microwave| the in room bar was empty and the parking was down the street. We had to walk a few blocks for a bag of ice! There is also a $50 per day charge that's extra. There was 3 of us in the room and we had to ask for clean towels everyday and every time they would bring only 2! It was overall a terrible disappointment. I would not recommend this Hilton at all.,Jun 28| 2021,1,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001

No microwave| no fridge and the in room bar was empty. They only good part of the room was the shower. Overall this was a terrible room and I would look elsewhere for a hotel.,Jun 29| 2021,1,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001

Our experience with this hotel was very very disappointing. Especially for a Hilton. The room was not cleaned one time during our 4 night stay. Not once! We even asked for it to be cleaned including fresh sheets but they never came. The air conditioning was not very good. The room was very small compared to the pictures online. No refrigerator| no ice machine| no microwave| the in room bar was empty and the parking was down the street. We had to walk a few blocks for a bag of ice! There is also a $50 per day charge that's extra. There was 3 of us in the room and we had to ask for clean towels everyday and every time they would bring only 2! It was overall a terrible disappointment. I would not recommend this Hilton at all.,Jun 28| 2021,1,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001
I wish the room was a little bit bigger and that the beds were bigger. NO ICE MACHINE was a drag. Nice restaurant and rooftop cafe within hotel| but they were really expensive. Overall though| it was a nice stay.,Jun 27| 2021,4,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001

First time to NY| hotel was nice and clean. I didn’t get a chance to hang out at the roof top bar| which I think should be open to folks staying at the hotel without reservations. I was told you had to make reservations. Only thing I would’ve added was a fridge and access to ice. I enjoyed the stay.

We were told the in house restaurant and bar were closed so we received our $50/day resort credits at a convenience store down the street.  The first day it was fun but no one wants to eat there for four days.  At least we never ran out of bottled water.  Also there was no housekeeping due to covid but they don’t tell you that until you arrive.  The staff was amazingly helpful but with the lack of housekeeping| the mess outside (construction)| the only one working elevator removed the glamour of my first trip to NYC.  It wasn’t horrible but I wish I had stayed somewhere else.,Jun 15| 2021,4,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001
One of the very slower elevators was out of service. They didn’t have air conditioning turned on for the hallways and with the heat| it was uncomfortable to wait for the elevators. I arranged to have room service come in to clean my room and that wasn’t done. I tried to get a cocktails on the rooftop bar and was turned away even though they were accepting walk ins and appeared to have plenty of room on a Tuesday night. The downstairs bar was never open.,Jun 15| 2021,3,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001
Hotel was under construction/ renovation. Fitness room was also closed for renovation. No microwave or fridge in the room. Only a small locked fridge to dispense their own merchandise. No drinking water available: only Hilton honor members could get 2 bottle water a day. I was at many Hilton hotels before and this was the worst. Front desk people were friendly and polite.,Jun 15| 2021,2,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001
This is a not a 4 star hotel. It was the perfect example of when hotel companies strip services. No ice machine. handicap stay away. You cannot make an ice pack.

Our experience was terrible| especially considering that it was our first time traveling after Covid. This is a Hilton? The front of the building is covered in unmarked scaffolding with the only barely noticeable| unlit Hilton signage set way back and printed on the temporary "plastic" entry doors that can only be seen when you walk by and look really hard. Our room was dark and depressing with very dark blue carpeting| dark brown (almost black) dinged up furniture| and a dark blue photo wall (of abstrated "trees"?) The carpeting was dusty| the TV remote was dead and when we took it down to the front desk (we also requested an extra pillow)| we never heard from anyone again| and never got back the remote - or the pillow. The bed felt really old and soft| the outlet next to the bed was dead and didn't charge my phone| and the room phone was dead (and filthy). Also| the fitness facility was still closed with no mention of that on Expedia or in the hotel notes| and there was dirty laundry - stained towels and sheets - left on the floor hallway outside our room for hours. Someone spilled candy in the hall that was crushed into the dirty carpet and stayed that way for two days. UGH| Hilton| never again. Our son just moved to the neighborhood and we plan to be there often but there are a lot of other options - we won't be back.,Jun 14| 2021,1,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001
No ice machine on premises. Elevator wasn’t reliable. Having to spend $200 on hotel or bodega credit and not being able to cash it or take it off bill.,Jun 14| 2021,3,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001

Overall the experience was good. Only feedback is would’ve been nice to have a fridge to put our drinks in. The fridge is designed so that it is strictly a mini bar. The gym is also small and dated.

The hotel was clean| modern and comfortable| away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square but only a 10-15 minute walk away.  A convenient subway station is only three blocks away.  Good selection of TV channels.  Pouty children in the adjoining room could be easily heard. Main complaint was with their so-called “room service”.  At check-in the receptionist said the restaurant was not operating but that we could order “24 hour room service”.  It turned out their “room service” was an 800 phone call to an outside operation that sent half warm food from who knows where by delivery boy.  Being Christmas evening when calling to order and discovering the true nature of this “service”| we had no Plan B.  Maybe this is a new fad employed nowadays by hotels?  Don’t know. But we felt the receptionist was purposely vague| if not outright misleading| in saying they had “room service”. Also we did not like the motion sensor light in the bathroom| but that was easily foiled by placing a towel over the sensor.  All in all| a quite suitable hotel.,Dec 28| 2019,5,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001

Bed was a little smaller than a queen but we managed ok. There was some minor issues with the safe not closing but again we just kept trying. Finally| they need to add a floor lamp or better ceiling lights in the entry to our room 1005. It was a little dark. The nice part about this room is that it was at the end of the hall (which is not very long) and opened up to the street. Nice natural light. It is on the noisy side due to a nightclub being down the road.,Sep 13| 2019,4,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001
The property was very clean and the check-in and out process was seamless.  However| the room was dark| even with all the lights turns on and it is definitely worn a bit.

The hotel was close to transportation. It had a rooftop bar that seemed to appeal to young people. Our first room was not clean at all. We were moved to another cleaner room but it had a queen bed. Our reservation was for a king size bed. The girl expained that this room was more expensive than the king on a lower floor but they would not charge us more. Head scratcher! There was no fridge| not even a mirror outside the bathroom. Did not live up to Hilton standards. I just feel that they took advantage of us. We did not get what we paid for.

This is unacceptable however the hotel manager was rude and  informed me they would not be compensating me any further|  I am an Hilton Honors member and I will NOT be staying at Hilton Hotels any longer!,Aug 8| 2019,1,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001

I was asking for a taxi| then they offer their own driver for $50 ( include tip) to LGA airport. I took the deal| when we arrived at the airport| the driver asked  $53. I gave him $50 because it was the deal with the front desk woman. I’m not sure even $50 deal was still good. It took just 15 minutes to get there.,Aug 5| 2019,3,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001

The location of this property is great. The beds were smaller than "queen size" as advertised. My room was located next to the supply closet and it was very noisy as the cleaning staff began their work and continued through the night. There were no places to hang wet towels in the bathroom or hand towels. The bag checking system was easy and helpful| as were the attendants.,Jul 3| 2019,3,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001
After a long day of walking around and going back up to the room the key did NOT work. Went back down and got new keys and back up to the room again and they didn’t work either. Had to go all the way back down to the front lobby. It took about 30 minutes of time wasted trying to get access into my room.

I did not like that check in was so delayed for such a time-pressured day. We came for pride and I had requested an early check in weeks prior and then the day of I called at 12 pm and was told a room would be ready by 1 pm just to find out that no room was ready and we waited 2 and a half hours for a room to open and went past the normal check-in time. We missed half the parade.,Jul 2| 2019,1,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001

Wish there was an ice machine as we couldn’t have any cold water/drinks. Also wish the fridge wasn’t completely pre occupied with drinks you had to pay for. We had brought drinks that needed to be in the fridge but had to just get over that. Besides that the front desk people were amazing in making our world pride trip a success and letting us know how to take the subway when all streets were blocked. It was a life saver.,Jul 1| 2019,4,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001

Hotel had a dirty sock that did not belong to us next to the bed. Otherwise room appeared clean. Bellhop was nice and helpful and so was the receptionist. At night we had friends over at the rooftop bar. Before they left we were having a conversation in the lobby for a while.  We were approached by a staff member who asked if we were guests in the hotel| to which I replied that myself and my husband were but not the other 3 people. He then demanded to see a room key which my husband was looking for. He then demanded more aggressively that we show him our key which I produced. We all understand that safety is key and that he was within his rights to ask to see it| however as a group of black people being approached by another black man that was sent by the white man over to us and being spoken to so inappropriately| we took great offense. This was around 1:15am on Sunday morning on 6/16/19.

My stayed was terrible| the hotel hallway smelled like weed| the people next to my room were smoking weed and the security had to come over a few times |it was a lot of noise and I couldn't sleep.

Room smaller than advertised.  Horrible experience coming home to an uncleaned room even after requesting service midday.  Property offered no compensation.   Definitely not up to Hilton standards by any means|  more like a bad Motel 6.

We stayed at the Hilton in the Fashion district on the President’s day weekend of 2019.The location was excellent because it was centrally located and close to the subway.  It’s a nice neighborhood between Chelsea and the Flatiron district. There are cool restaurants and bars for a dinner or nightcap. Parking on the street was available. The hotel is modern with a classy lobby. Our room was small by most suburban hotel standards but for the location and price| it was a value.,Feb 21| 2019,4,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001

We stayed at the Hilton during the polar vortex. Staff was wonderful and checkin was super fast. However| both me and my wife got bedbug bites all over our back! We had a short stay and on the morning of our flight back home we noticed we were itchy and my wifes back is covered in red bumps. Im grossed out. The hotel is in an excellent location. The room was small which is normal for nyc| but the thermostat was so dry i kept waking up to drink and hack a lung. It was the dryest hotel I've ever stayed at.. again it was the polar vortex so maybe not their fault but im wondering about their filter systems and such. The bed was comfortable but soo hot. I would unfortunately not stay here again :( we like the cambria and ace. Im sorry to write this but I wish i had read a review about the bedbugs prior to booking :(,Feb 2| 2019,2,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001

Location was ideal for my 2-day stay in NYC. Room was small but bed was very comfortable| bathroom was clean and relatively spacious| TV options (including HBO) were good.

Check-in at this hotel was terrible. The person at the front desk kept glaring at me and my friend through the whole check-in process. She made us feel like we were a waste of her time and energy. She kept rolling her eyes and sighing the whole time. On top of that| none of the additional charges (ie. the room security) were explained to me when I saw that my total went up. Luckily| I did find someone the next day that explained the rules concerning the charge.,Jan 9| 2019,3,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001
The view was the best part I found myself sleeping with the window shades open so I could see it all as I fell asleep. I was on the 20th floor definitely recommend!!

The room was very big unlike the ROW. WE WE went on rooftop for New Year’s Eve party. The party was good and played good music. Many people cane casual. I wore a gown. I was more dressed up. I think there should be address code in a 4 star hotel for NY eve.,Jan 2| 2019,5,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001
Honestly no comments it was ok nothing big about this parking fee way too high for the price you would expect breakfast or something. Snack overpriced smh,Jan 1| 2019,3,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001
I loved the neighborhood| Chelsea| and how easy it was to get everywhere on the subway. My favorite part was all the great places to eat around here.  Nice people too.,Jan 1| 2019,5,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001
good location and rooftop bar was cool but quiet. Staff gave no attention to anyone and rooms were small Typical for NYC. nothing made this a unique hotel.,Dec 30| 2018,3,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001
The rooms are cozy but well laid out with large flat screen TV| K-cup coffee and and outstanding shower with hot hot water. Nice view of empire state building and a great location near the action in mid town Manhattan but not in the middle of the action (i.e.| not too close to Times Square),Jan 4| 2019,5,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001

We were given a room on a side of the hotel facing a set of high walled buildings and outside fire exits  it was extremely dark| to the point where the room needed lights on at all times day and night. The room itself was very nice. The hotel had a much trailed rooftop bar. We tried to go up and were refused access on all three days and nights . very disappointing; I guess we weren't the correct sort of people to get to walk behind the rope and the 2 bouncers and the roped- off lift in our hotel lobby| the hotel we paid good money to stay in. Left a very bad taste in our mouths.,Jul 28| 2018,3,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001

Hotel recentemente rimodernato in una zona comoda tra Empire State Building e Flatiron| vicina anche al nuovo complesso di Hudson Yards (tutti raggiungibili a piedi) oltre che a Penn Station. Rooftop bar al 23 piano. Camere Ok per dimensione e pulizia; assolutamente non soddisfacenti i servizi di room service (molto limitato e non buono) e lavanderia (invece di lavare spruzzano un qualche appretto e stirano| male; igienicamente inaccettabile| mi sono tornati pantaloni e camicie usate nel caldo di agosto| dopo questo trattamento immaginate la puzza che avevano).,Sep 12| 2019,4,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001

Nous avions pris etage supérieur| nous étions ainsi au 18 eme étage sur 22| avec vue superbe sur l’empire State building. Insonorisation bien| literie bien aussi. Pour le roof top| il faut bien penser à prendre sa carte de chambre et carte d'identité pour y aller| l’accès se fait depuis le hall de l’hôtel à partir d’un ascenseur dédié. Nous avons testé le restaurant| très bon ! Et agréable de rester sur place après une longue journée.Personnel à l’écoute et sympathique.Hôtel très bien placé| à pied de l’empire state building pour faire la visite de nuit  ç’était Top!Très beau séjour.,Jul 11| 2019,5,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001

Das Hotel eignet sich gut für einen dienstlichen oder privaten Aufenthalt.Sehr zentral und eine Subway Station in der Nähe.Personal war freundlich und zuvorkommend.Sauberkeit ist ok| aber nicht perfekt.Der Standard entspricht dem US Hilton Standard| für mich absolut ausreichend.Für NY Verhältnisse große Zimmer| die Tür könnte besser gedämmt sein.Das Frühstück / Gym habe ich nicht genutzt.,Jul 6| 2019,5,Hilton New York Fashion District,152 W 26th Street| Manhattan| New York| NY| 10001
