Hotel was nice. Under our toilet seat was gross. Everything else seemed to be well put together. We texted valet as instructed and received a response right away for our car and after 20 minutes they had not gotten our car. It took them another 20 and they said we should just come tell them next time and wait out side. For $64 to park it’s no worth it but you don’t have many other options. Everyone in the hotel and valet seem to pay more attention to cell phones than guest with the exception of the lady working the breakfast bar. She was amazing and very nice.,Jun 28| 2021,3,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

It was definitely the WORST Hilton I have been to. I understand we are in a pandemic - but they should just shut this place down instead of completely ignoring the guests and saying no to even the smallest of requests - like borrowing a corkscrew from your closed bar so they would never miss it for a few minutes.  No parking service| no baggage handling| no food service - the bed was uncomfortable and the staff was non-existent - as was the parking. The only good thing was the location.,Dec 22| 2020,2,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036
Fantastic building in a great location.  The staff was warm and welcoming for sure!  The parking was only valet so we chose a self park option the first night and were charged for 2 days so the next night we did street parking Great restaurant in the hotel with nice staff made our burger and beer deal a treat!  Mazie restaurant around the corner has the BEST food !!,Dec 21| 2020,5,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

This was the worst hotel ever we were harrassed by staff and police were using our hotel like a police station not to mention that they kept walking past our hotel so we could be harassed and sprayed with pepper spray and have fireworks shot at us right across the street from Where we were staying,Dec 19| 2020,1,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

It’s a very nice hotel however our room had a plumbing problem. The toilet was running and leaking. The problem was fixed however it kept running on and off throughout the stay. Also| the water was a bit cold. The first 2 days it wouldn’t heat up. No fridge to store any cold items. The vending machines were empty. We understand the restrictions of Covid but It just seemed like the place was a bit deserted. The gift shop was closed but only opened on weekends| which seemed odd. The people at the reservation desks were very nice.,Dec 17| 2020,4,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036
The hotel is in an optimal location and surrounding tons of touristy sites and shops. The hotel itself was very basic to be called the Capital Hilton. Inside was very dated and not a lot of amenities. Also| due to the pandemic| some of the inside facilities were not operating. We were there for four nights and had to beg for a refrigerator| as I guess they had them all removed due to the pandemic| as well| which didn't make a lot of sense to me. Though the hotel was a ghost town| the front desk staff always seemed too busy or annoyed with assistance| with the exception of a very sweet and knowledgeable lady who checked us in and insisted on getting us a refrigerator.

They charge 50 for accidental per day| and 60 for parking per day| so add that to whatever the room cost!,Dec 28| 2020,1,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036
Check in agent was exceptionally kind and considerate.,Dec 23| 2020,5,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036
It was definitely the WORST Hilton I have been to. I understand we are in a pandemic - but they should just shut this place down instead of completely ignoring the guests and saying no to even the smallest of requests - like borrowing a corkscrew from your closed bar so they would never miss it for a few minutes.  No parking service| no baggage handling| no food service - the bed was uncomfortable and the staff was non-existent - as was the parking. The only good thing was the location.,Dec 22| 2020,2,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036
Fantastic building in a great location.  The staff was warm and welcoming for sure!  The parking was only valet so we chose a self park option the first night and were charged for 2 days so the next night we did street parking Great restaurant in the hotel with nice staff made our burger and beer deal a treat!  Mazie restaurant around the corner has the BEST food !!,Dec 21| 2020,5,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

This was the worst hotel ever we were harrassed by staff and police were using our hotel like a police station not to mention that they kept walking past our hotel so we could be harassed and sprayed with pepper spray and have fireworks shot at us right across the street from Where we were staying,Dec 19| 2020,1,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

It’s a very nice hotel however our room had a plumbing problem. The toilet was running and leaking. The problem was fixed however it kept running on and off throughout the stay. Also| the water was a bit cold. The first 2 days it wouldn’t heat up. No fridge to store any cold items. The vending machines were empty. We understand the restrictions of Covid but It just seemed like the place was a bit deserted. The gift shop was closed but only opened on weekends| which seemed odd. The people at the reservation desks were very nice.,Dec 17| 2020,4,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036
The hotel is in an optimal location and surrounding tons of touristy sites and shops. The hotel itself was very basic to be called the Capital Hilton. Inside was very dated and not a lot of amenities. Also| due to the pandemic| some of the inside facilities were not operating. We were there for four nights and had to beg for a refrigerator| as I guess they had them all removed due to the pandemic| as well| which didn't make a lot of sense to me. Though the hotel was a ghost town| the front desk staff always seemed too busy or annoyed with assistance| with the exception of a very sweet and knowledgeable lady who checked us in and insisted on getting us a refrigerator. She's the real MVP.,Nov 30| 2020,3,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

Parking situation was difficult. Only one staff member available on check in and he was less than helpful on offering advice on places that I could eat at or the best area to look to park as you have to street park. I’ve spent many trips on capital hill and I wouldn’t stay here again.,Oct 26| 2020,2,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

We were charged $50 per day incidental charge at check in.

It was a good location to public transport and the front desk and staff were very helpful.We stayed in a 2 queen bed room which had an illogical set up. There was a lot of space in the centre of the room| likely another bed's length. The beds faced a couch| and a large tv on to of a cabinet were both pushed to the side| so neither the beds or the couch faced the TV. The bed I slept in was very firm on one side and sunk down on the other side. Overall| I felt like I was staying in a very spacious room of leftover furniture| in a hotel that could have been any other one besides the Hilton.,Jan 6| 2020,3,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

Room was small and smelled stale. Walls were very thin| could easily hear what the people in the room next door were saying. Could also hear exactly what was going on in our bathroom-no privacy when you're trying to pee! Garbage cans had no bags| coffeemaker smelled very strongly of vinegar| bathroom sink/vanity had piece of the 'wood' finishing gone. Pay-per-view movies were $20. Hotel restaurant prices were astronomical. Disappointed; I expected more from Hilton.,Jan 6| 2020,2,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

The hotel relented after I caused a fuss and told them we didn’t need/want to make charges to our room.,Jan 8| 2020,3,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036
It was clean and had friendly staff. Bar and r staurant was good.,Jan 8| 2020,5,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036
It was a good location to public transport and the front desk and staff were very helpful.We stayed in a 2 queen bed room which had an illogical set up. There was a lot of space in the centre of the room| likely another bed's length. The beds faced a couch| and a large tv on to of a cabinet were both pushed to the side| so neither the beds or the couch faced the TV. The bed I slept in was very firm on one side and sunk down on the other side. Overall| I felt like I was staying in a very spacious room of leftover furniture| in a hotel that could have been any other one besides the Hilton.,Jan 6| 2020,3,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

Room was small and smelled stale. Walls were very thin| could easily hear what the people in the room next door were saying. Could also hear exactly what was going on in our bathroom-no privacy when you're trying to pee! Garbage cans had no bags| coffeemaker smelled very strongly of vinegar| bathroom sink/vanity had piece of the 'wood' finishing gone. Pay-per-view movies were $20. Hotel restaurant prices were astronomical. Disappointed; I expected more from Hilton.,Jan 6| 2020,2,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036
The size of the room was good for myself and my fiancé. It was wonderful and spotless.,Jan 5| 2020,5,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036
It has a privileged location| close to everything. The only thing I didn’t like was the mattress| extremely soft to my likes,Jan 4| 2020,4,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

It's a beautiful| historic hotel in downtown DC| easy to get to wherever you want to go| thanks not just to being downtown| but its proximity to three different Metro stops.  But what sticks out is how quickly the staff assisted me| from helping me with my bags to asking if I needed a taxi after I checked out.  The only time I ever had to ask for help was when I couldn't locate the remote in the room ... and even on that| they went above and beyond.  A replacement remote was quickly brought to my room and the staff member who brought it stayed until I tested it| to ensure it actually worked.,Dec 31| 2019,5,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

I liked the location of the property. I also enjoyed the staff. They were very professional.I did not like the fact that I paid for an upgraded room that we have to move from. The bathroom door did not have a handle on it and when you closed the bathroom door it was hanging. The tiles on the bathroom floor were loose. There was a very noticeable dip on the floor in front of the full length mirror.When I went to the front desk| I was told that the bathroom doors don't have handles but an engineer would come by to see what the issue is with the door hanging. Anthony| the engineer came to inspect everything and immediately called the front desk to have our room moved. Unfortunately it was a downgrade but safer that the room we were in. The room we were moved to was much smaller and the lock on the door did not work. The remote control was also missing out of the second room but Anthony to the rescue again with the remote. Had it not been for Anthony| I think our Christmas would have been horrible.,Dec 29| 2019,2,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

We a had a fabulous trip| our first to DC. I wanted to be close so splurged on this hotel Worth every penny. Great| safe beighborhood. We walked to the White House in 12 mins| restaurants in 3.  We took the subway everywhere else in 10-12.Service was fantastic. You know how a hotel really is when something goes wrong. We had a tub drain that stuck and my son could not shower until it drained from my bath.  Steve the maintenance man came fast and was polite and efficient. He fixed it FAST.  Best of all| they watched our luggage in a secure closet after checkout so we could thoroughly enjoy one more monument and museum the last day.  When I saw other tourists with luggage at the National Mall| I especially appreciated that amenity.,Oct 14| 2019,5,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

Upon arrival to The Capital Hilton they told me and my fiancé they were booked up... I thought this was funny because we already had a reservation with Expedia| after some time they found a room and put us in a downgraded room from what we reserved on Expedia.The room they put me and my fiancé was on a floor full of camp kids that were running around yelling past 2am.

We a had a fabulous trip| our first to DC. I wanted to be close so splurged on this hotel Worth every penny. Great| safe beighborhood. We walked to the White House in 12 mins| restaurants in 3.  We took the subway everywhere else in 10-12.Service was fantastic. You know how a hotel really is when something goes wrong. We had a tub drain that stuck and my son could not shower until it drained from my bath.  Steve the maintenance man came fast and was polite and efficient. He fixed it FAST.  Best of all| they watched our luggage in a secure closet after checkout so we could thoroughly enjoy one more monument and museum the last day.  When I saw other tourists with luggage at the National Mall| I especially appreciated that amenity.,Oct 14| 2019,5,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

Upon arrival to The Capital Hilton they told me and my fiancé they were booked up... I thought this was funny because we already had a reservation with Expedia| after some time they found a room and put us in a downgraded room from what we reserved on Expedia.The room they put me and my fiancé was on a floor full of camp kids that were running around yelling past 2am.

Traveled with family. Our room had a lot of street noise. Room service was not great. Greeting from the staff in driveway was amazing. I forgot his name.,Jul 4| 2019,3,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

The property is centrally located in D.C.| just blocks from the White House with a lot of cool restaurants in the area. The lobby is spacious and welcoming. The carpet looks like it's twenty-five years out of date and does not otherwise match the decor of the hotel. They should consider upgrading their flooring.,Jul 3| 2019,4,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

The staff were excellent. Very nice| kind and so friendly and helpful. The room was ok but nothing special. The room had an odor of stale cigarette smoke. Most of the light fixtures were dusty. Light bulbs missing on lamps. The carpet was vacuumed daily but felt soiled when walking barefoot. The mattress/ pillows were actually great. The entrance( entry floor) to the bathroom had a raised area that looked like granite or marble| and unless you knew to raise up your foot| you stump your toe/ feet when entering. The bathroom / mirror area was very small. The bathroom sink faucet was leaking so water was everywhere. The toilet was placed so close to the wall it was a struggle to access the toilet paper dispenser on the wall next to the toilet|unless you were a child. The exhaust fan in the bathroom was extremely loud. The stopper/ drain in the bathtub was pulled out about 6 inches with hair and other mess attached to it. Gross. There was no walk-in shower but the shower head was excellent and gave great water pressure. The bathtub was a standard bathtub| nothing special. We only had room service for a late dinner 10:45pm| once so I can’t honestly rate the food. What I had was ok and not a great menu| in my opinion. The gift shop has a great variety of items and very expensive. The best part of the hotel was the excellent staff. Just not enough other positives to make me stay there again| which I will not.,Jun 22| 2019,3,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

I asked for a full total bill when I left including  parking and other inclusions and I did not get it. They told me that my booking people| that would be Travelocity| would be sending me that bill.

Excellent location and service. Close to White House and Metro. Complimentary continental breakfast was great also full breakfast for small charge was fantastic! Hotel shop was great and convenient.  Concierge was extremely helpful and friendly. Only downfall was the view of roof and satelite but weren't looking out that often.  The bed was amazingly comfortable. Maid service was fast| friendly and efficient. Thank you for a great trip to D.C.,Apr 22| 2019,5,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036
Efficient valet parking however| had to wait 25 minutes for valet to get car at 5am even after calling down.  $62 very expensive!,Apr 22| 2019,4,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

the hotel and service was great| however the room we got had a malfunctioning shower head| which almost resulted in potential injury to my daughters head. The shower head mounting bracket did not stay on and precariously was situated in its cradle.This was a heavy quality brushed nickel kohler shower head which fell and almost cause injury to my daughter. The swivel would not stay in place and the weight of the shower head causes it to continually fall down| which made showering difficult . I am certain this was an isolated incident| and I trust that after addressing the problem they have since fixed the shower head. Otherwise the room was agreeable and the service helpful .,Apr 15| 2019,4,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

The location and overall hotel was excellent- very happy with our choice.  Only thing negative I can say was that they have a Hilton staff member there constantly trying to sell you trips and on other Hilton services. Very pushy and over the top.

Service has gone down considerably. When I called room service I was put on hold for 5 minutes. I was out of my room from 9am until 3pm. When I returned my room had not been cleaned. I called housekeeping to report this. 10 minutes went by until someone came to take care of the situation. She made the bed as a 6 year old would have done. That is all she did in my room| make the bed| but nothing else. Lightbulbs in the bathroom were not working. I reported it but nothing was done. I was extremely disappointed with my experience.

The room was noted to be hypoallergenic but the soap was definitely not as I broke out in hives. room service leaves a lot to be desired especially in the price category! Front desk staff is rude.

The room was noted to be hypoallergenic but the soap was definitely not as I broke out in hives. room service leaves a lot to be desired especially in the price category! Front desk staff is rude. I arrived and asked a simple question of where I would’ve hand my bag off to for storage in the wrap try to check me out and charge me a fee after I told her I was not interested in checking in. I honestly will not recommend this hotel,Dec 17| 2018,1,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

This hotel is in a great location and has a long history. Staff for the most part were very helpful and friendly. However| when we checked in we were asked if we wanted to pay for an upgrade which was unusual for us. Next| when we inquired about wi-fi we were forced into joining the hilton honors program in order to get free wi-fi. (Our reservation said free wi-fi). Thereafter| we had to constantly log in again as we kept losing wi-fi. The room was stuffy| outdated and you had to be a contortionist to reach the wands for the curtains. The pillows were small and inadequate. Appropriately| they did not allow smoking within a certain distance of the entrance. At that distance (which was on the most popular route to points of interest) there were cigarette butts everywhere| which of course attracted the homeless. I never saw anyone clean them up. We were supposed to get newspapers with the room. We checked in on Friday and Saturday morning I asked about the newspaper and was told they do not provide a newspaper on the weekend. There was a nice looking souvenir shop but I never saw a single person in it. I tried to purchase a newspaper in the shop but they had outdated papers or Sunday's paper on Saturday. On Monday| the day we were checking out I located the paper they provided: USA Today. Hello| Capital Hilton| this is Washington DC| our nation's capital. How about one of our nation's capital's newspapers. They need to renovate| upgrade and retrain.,Oct 23| 2018,3,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

First off| we were really glad that we stayed here. The hotel is in a great location for seeing DC. We'd walk from our room to the National Mall in 10-15 minutes| or get onto a Metro in like 3 mins. The staff was all very friendly and helpful with whatever questions we had. The building itself is nice but is definitely starting to get old. The rooms are comfortable and get the job done.,Oct 22| 2018,4,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

It was early check in. First| we have been told there are no rooms available at all| and the only suits is the option for extra $200 additional cost. We refused that offer and then got our room. It was a lie about not having any rooms. Second| our room was dirty. I saw chips on the floor and hairs in the bathroom. One of the towels had foundation spots on it.

We stayed at the hotel only for one night for a family wedding.  I am very happy with the staff- everyone was very nice and eager to assist.  However| we did not receive the welcome kit our hosts left for us.  Also there is no free parking at the hotel| everything is valet and can add up.  The bar is very expensive - one Petrone on the rocks cost me $17.95 before the tip.  The bed itself was very soft| I was fine with it but my wife hated it.  Shower and water pressure was better than expected. The room was small and decor was somewhat beat up and outdated.  View is non-existent. All in all| although the stay is doable for a short term visit like ours| be prepared to pay a lot for parking and any drinks you get at the bar.  Gift shop is good and reasonably priced.,Oct 17| 2018,3,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

The best thing about this hotel was that it was so close to the National Mall! Each day| my husband and I walked the 20-30 minutes to the monuments and museums. There were good restaurant options nearby and overall we were happy with the cleanliness of the room. They only issue we had was that when we walked by the concierge| we got the Hilton Honors pitch even when we politely declined and tried to walk away; I understand that that's their job though and the gentleman pitching was super nice.,Sep 23| 2018,4,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036
$60 for valet parking is insanely excessive.. no one should be forced to pay $60 for valet. I would have loved to park my own car and saved money. My only option was to park 3 blocks away and hope I found a meter for free. If you’re not going to allow self parking| LOWER YOUR VALET PRICING!! will not be visiting this hotel or any other Hilton again for that reason.,Sep 23| 2018,3,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

The staff was mediocre at check in and check out. The hotel and room itself was a little old but clean and had everything we needed. I was disappointed to see that I was charged $60 for valet parking even though I did not park at the hotel. No staff informed us about this charge| or even asked if we were parking at the premise--we were simply charged for it. It felt that it was a somewhat deceitful practice from the hotel and if I didn't check the charges| I wouldn't have been able to rectify it. I've reached out numerous times to get an answer as to why this happened| but was not given the courtesy of a response or apology. There's a lot of hotels available at the area. I will not be staying here again and would avoid Hilton if I can in the future.,Aug 31| 2018,3,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

(주차비를 물어보고 비싸서 그냥 다른 사설에 주차하겠다고 하니 직원이 안내해줌. 다른분들도 주차가 필요하면 인근 사설 주차장에 spothero등으로 이용하시는거 추천합니다.)호텔 근처에 조식을 먹을만한 식당들이 몇 군데 있어서 굳이 호텔 조식 옵션으로 하지 않으셔도 될 듯 합니다. 1박 후 다시 1박을 해서 방을 2개 썼는데 둘 다 방 크기도 괜찮았고| 방 위치가 대로변이 아니어서 잘 때 시끄럽거나 하지 않았습니다. 1층에 CVS는 공사중이어서 이용하지 못했지만| 완공되면 편리하게 이용 가능하실 것 같아요. 참... 숙박객들 나갈 때 들고 나가시라고 호텔 입구에서 얼음물에 담군 생수를 서비스로 주는거 같더군요. 좋은 인상 받았습니다.,Sep 2| 2019,4,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

初めてのDCステイでしたが、とても快適に過ごせました。過度なサービスもなく、応対も丁寧でした。部屋の広さは日本の狭いホテルに比べたら十分です。また、総じて静かでしたが、1日だけ、廊下で大声で騒いでいるグループがいて、常識を疑いました。  ホワイトハウスからとても近く、メトロを使う程ではありません。むしろ、自転車やスクーターが便利です。ただし、周辺には飲食店は少ないので、少し歩く覚悟が必要です。メトロの駅は3つありますので行き先に応じて選んで下さい。部屋にはスリッパ、冷蔵庫はありません。コーヒーマシンはありますが、専用のパックのため、お湯を沸かしてお茶を飲むことはできません。アメリカの大都市の一般的ホテルの値段を考えると妥当な価格だと思います。日本人スタッフはいませんが、標準的な英語レベルがあれば何の問題もありません。,Aug 28| 2019,4,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

初めてのDCステイでしたが、とても快適に過ごせました。過度なサービスもなく、応対も丁寧でした。部屋の広さは日本の狭いホテルに比べたら十分です。また、総じて静かでしたが、1日だけ、廊下で大声で騒いでいるグループがいて、常識を疑いました。  ホワイトハウスからとても近く、メトロを使う程ではありません。むしろ、自転車やスクーターが便利です。ただし、周辺には飲食店は少ないので、少し歩く覚悟が必要です。メトロの駅は3つありますので行き先に応じて選んで下さい。部屋にはスリッパ、冷蔵庫はありません。コーヒーマシンはありますが、専用のパックのため、お湯を沸かしてお茶を飲むことはできません。アメリカの大都市の一般的ホテルの値段を考えると妥当な価格だと思います。日本人スタッフはいませんが、標準的な英語レベルがあれば何の問題もありません。,Aug 28| 2019,4,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

Executive roomを予約したが、部屋に一人がけの小さなイスが1つ。カフェテーブルの小さいのがあっただけ。部屋は無駄に広かった。Executiveのclubラウンジもないとのこと。今まで各地のヒルトンホテルを利用してきたが最低の部類に入る。7月に利用したパリのヒルトンホテルは部屋はそれほど広くないが、Club ラウンジの充実ぶりは素晴らしかったので、ヒルトンホテルでも格差があることがわかった。この選択は失敗でした。,Apr 9| 2019,1,The Capital Hilton,1001 16th St NW| Washington| DC| 20036

Service war furchtbar. Es fand abends eine große hoteleigene Party statt| bei der es so laut war| dass die Gläser im Zimmer vibriert haben.
