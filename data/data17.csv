The hotel is nice| not large and has three elevators.  We never had to wait at any point during the day.  Plus you had to use your room key to enable the elevator.  We paid extra for the breakfast| they have a menu or buffet.  The food was good| the servers were very nice.  There are couple of places in the areas to grab coffee| sandwich or pastry if you don't want to sit down and eat.  The hotel is close to Madison Square gardens| not a lot of restaurants to eat at in the area.,Feb 3| 2020,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018

I felt the room was too small| and the closet was very difficult and small. The room probably would have fine for one. I’m 74 and was very uncomfortable with tub shower. However| room with two beds doesn’t have a walk-in shower. I had requested a walk-in when reservation was made but was not told that you don’t have that combination.

A good| comfortable hotel with excellent service.  We were seen to immediately on arrival with a friendly welcome.  As we had arrived in the morning straight from a cruise the room wasn't ready but our luggage was taken straight to a secure room to await our return from a stroll around the area (well situated for Times Square itself & walkable to most local sights).  The lobby area was quite small but with comfortable chairs & chilled water available.  A small in hotel shop had most things you could require.  The attached Irish pub/restaurant 'Doylers' gave us just what we wanted on a cold October evening (Fish & chips & Shepard's pie!)  The room was a reasonable size| air conditioned & with a comfortable king sized bed.  Complimentary wi-fi was available throughout the hotel.

Love the location and the price. Staff was incredible at the front desk. Cons: Bed was HORRIFIC! It felt like I was sleeping on plywood boards. Had to ask for more pillows to use as a mattress pad.When we got to the room| the door wasn’t latching properly| even with the deadbolt. Maintenance was great| and reassured us it was fine. However| they shouldn’t be checking guests into a room unless the entry way is 100% secure.Would I stay at Hilton again? YesThis location?

Had to ask for more pillows to use as a mattress pad.When we got to the room| the door wasn’t latching properly| even with the deadbolt. Maintenance was great| and reassured us it was fine. However| they shouldn’t be checking guests into a room unless the entry way is 100% secure.Would I stay at Hilton again? YesThis location? If better mattresses were installed.,Sep 11| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018
This hotel was great| close to many attractions and to many bars/restaurants/bakery etc. Nothing to complain about.. I would definitely suggest it to everyone!,Sep 10| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018

They put us in a handicap room #805 which was fine but it was right next to a utility closet so we heard doors opening and closing all the time. Plus the other room doors were super close so there was constant noise.,Aug 26| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018
A TV pilot is being filmed in my house| so my girlfriend and I decided to get away to the city for a couple of nights. We were drawn to this particular hotel because of its convenient location in mid-town| the positive reviews from other guests| and the very affordable nightly rate. Check-in went smoothly| and we were given a room on the 20th floor. The room was clean| with big windows affording a nice view. I was surprised at the size of the room; much bigger than at| say| a Holiday Inn Express. The bed was comfortable| and the shower was big. Service was great for everything from housekeeping to sending out mail. 3 PM check-in and 12 noon check-out times are highly convenient. Nothing super fancy| but certainly a clean| comfortable place to stay.,Aug 24| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018
Room was spacious and comfortable. Polite staff. Window opened which is a huge plus. And finally a gym with working equipment - hooray! Only complaints: heavy air freshener smell in the room; and only one fan speed (noisy.) Blue Maiz good Mexican takeout and Pret a Manger nearby. Would definitely stay here again.,Aug 24| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018

Three nights in NYC. Check in was easy| particularly since I arrived at 10:30am| a room was ready for me| and there was no surcharge for early check-in| as some hotels do.  The staff is terrific; someone greets you every time you come in or leave.  Great housekeeping| quiet floors| a brightly lit bathroom and fast-arriving elevators.  A bit more expensive than my last stay at this property|| but hey| when you walk out the door you're in New York City.,Aug 13| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018

This hotel is not friendly for family vacation. We asked for a double bed room| there was none available. We could not leave either as it was pre-paid with Hotel for 6 nights. We ended up booking two rooms. During the last day| I asked again| and was told they had one available. They would hold it for us. So I returned one of the rooms| all packed up| waiting for the news that the room became available until 11:30 am. Still no news. I called the front desk again and was told it was not available anymore. They could have told us earlier. You can see the service here. The blind in the room broke. I asked them to fix it| they did| and it broke again. Make you wonder about other things. Definitely avoiding this place in the future| and having 2nd thoughts on Hilton Garden Inn which we're a Hhonor member of. I don't normally leave reviews| but feel like I need to for future travelers. Location is convenient.  That's the only thing.,Jul 24| 2019,1,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018

Check-in experience was excellent with very attentive front desk staff helping me with one hour early check-in.  Room was small and coffee maker| ironing board| folding suitcase holder| etc| are all hidden in small closet which I had to take out/set up by myself.  It was only one night stay just by myself| so size of the room was not really an issue and room has safe| refrigerator| microwave| and the hotel has a restaurant where I ordered food for delivery to the room which was convenient especially when I did not want to go out to eat.  Room was quiet and elevator works with room key which adds extra safety.  The only thing is price...

Charge for parking was extra and customer has to pay separately to garage. There should be a contract with parking garage and it should be included in the price.

Charge for parking was extra and customer has to pay separately to garage. There should be a contract with parking garage and it should be included in the price. It is a hassle if customer has to find parking garages late in evening & also to pay them. Breakfast was extra charge too & quite expensive!,Mar 26| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018

Very unhappy with both hotels.com and Hilton. There was some issue with the reservation and Hilton claims they did not receive the payment from hotels.com| without any notice Hilton charged my credit card to pay for the room... I spent 2 hours of my holidays trying to get it sorted via chat to finally get reimbursed in voucher money... What a mess| first time I use hotels and probably one of the last...,Feb 14| 2019,1,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018

Spotless modern hotel with very helpful friendly staff.Reception team is quite large and we spoke to six or seven different staff over our week there and everyone was excellent. Advice| directions and arranging a car to the airport all done superbly. The driver they use called Lewis is fantastic and Devon who manages all luggage and transport arrangements goes above and beyond. The hotel is a five minute walk to Times Square but is in a very quiet part of west 37th street. All taxes fees etc were included in the quoted price so no surprises at check out.Room has a small fridge| pod coffee machine and a microwave.,Feb 14| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018

The bed was super comfy| the fitness center well-stocked and clean| the check-in and check-out painless and since I had to leave very late on my check-out day I was even able to check my luggage all day.

This was a great hotel. Very clean and friendly staff. The only issue that I had was that when I booked the hotel it wasn’t clear that they had many properties in Manhattan. The one that I thought I booked wasn’t the one that I actually stayed in.

Great location in a quiet street with convenient access to dining and subway. Relatively new well kept rooms with microwave and fridge and a Keurig coffee maker. In-room safe was a bit small for fitting a 14'' laptop. Had to request the reception to hold it while we were out. Decent wi-fi with the policy allowing for 2 device connectivity limit which is flexible. We were in town to witness the 2019 ball drop at Times square and the with the rain deluge over the 7 hour queue wait| it was a godsend to take a break at the room.,Jan 3| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018

i enjoyed staying at this hotel. it was really clean| the room had a good amount of space for 2 people| and the location was good for being in times square. the only thing is parking. which is always so hard but it took forever to find a spot for a good price. wish they could offer a garage. other than that 10/10,Jan 1| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018

Great hotel and nice attached Irish Pub,Jan 4| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018
This was a great hotel. Very clean and friendly staff. The only issue that I had was that when I booked the hotel it wasn’t clear that they had many properties in Manhattan. The one that I thought I booked wasn’t the one that I actually stayed in. It was further away from Times Square than I thought.,Jan 4| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018

It was a great trip. The hotel and staff were absolutely wonderful.  The room was small & it had no closet (just a little hutch) but it worked out just fine.  We couldn’t have been more happy with our hotel.,Dec 24| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018
Parking overnight is $55 and the property is a bit off the beaten path for a tourist in NYC. The room was clean and even had a little microwave which is a nice accommodation for a small space... but the view from our window was another building and for the price you can get a hotel closer to Time Square with an amazing view. All in all likely will not stay here again based on personal preference| but would stay in a Hilton brand hotel in a better location.,Dec 24| 2018,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018

The view from our room was the worst view ever. We were looking at factories. Horrible!!  When asked for a different room they said there were no rooms left   also $4 for a bottle of water in the room is extortion!!  We just spent a lot on a room and you can't even give a free bottle of water!!!,Dec 1| 2018,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018

Uncomfortable bed with a hump in the middle. Service staff was excellent. Very clean. Price was a little bit high.,Dec 1| 2018,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018
Very clean hotel. Staff was excellent and helpful. My only complaint is the water bottles provided in the room not being free to all guests.,Dec 1| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018
The view from our room was the worst view ever. We were looking at factories. Horrible!!  When asked for a different room they said there were no rooms left   also $4 for a bottle of water in the room is extortion!!  We just spent a lot on a room and you can't even give a free bottle of water!!!,Dec 1| 2018,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018
So very clean and quiet. They offer a small market down in the lobby and there is an Irish bar in the lobby. Great stay !,Nov 30| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018

The location is fantastic| very central to all the big attractions. The price is also very good so this hotel is a great value. It’s clean and staff is professional. The room is a bit smaller but that is expected in central manhattan at that price point. Very clean| even got ya checked in early. Appreciate when staff goes above and beyond.,Nov 19| 2018,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018

Sam the hotel clerk who checked me in was the most engaging professional hotel clerk I've ever met in my 22 years of business travels,Nov 15| 2018,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018
I arrived early| albeit by only an hour| and hoped to check in at the hotel.  Alas| I was denied by the busy front desk| and asked to return at a later time.  While I had business meetings the remainder of the day| I arrived once again at 5:30PM.  While I booked a Deluxe King Room| I was directed to a Standard Accessible Room due to no availability.  It was unfortunate this occurred| HOWEVER I am going to allow the hotel a second chance to win my business travel| staying there again in two weeks.

While the room itself was snug; however| that's not unusual for a hotel room in NYC. I didn't mind since it was just me| and how the space was organized was efficient and effective.

What a kind and amazing staff! Arrived early 11am hoping to just drop off bags before an early show but was very surprised when they offered an early check in to us.  The room was spotless and smelled amazing(the very first comment my daughter made when we opened the door to our room).  Slept like a baby on the comfy bed.  It was so quiet that you would have never known you were on a busy NYC street.  Cannot wait to come back and stay here again!!,Oct 23| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018
Thumbs Up! Only downside was cleaning staff tried to come clean our room at 4:30pm when we were resting after a day of site seeing. Maybe an oversight?,Oct 23| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018
The hotel is in a very convenient area in the garment district. We used to live in the area so we knew it was a good one for our trip needs. It is close to all of the touristy lights of Times Square and the events of Madison Square Garden but tucked away on a relatively quiet (by NYC standards) street. It was so quiet all night. I heard more noise when we stayed with family in Westchester. We got a great night’s sleep. From check in to check out all of the staff we encountered were helpful and friendly. We will definitely be back. Thank you for making out quick getaway a great one!,Oct 23| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018

This location was perfect because we just the a few blocks from Times Square but also not stuck in all that traffic. Anything you needed was within walking distance or a quick uber ride! The staff was very warm and welcomed us a soon as we checked in| they explained all the details of our stay as well. The lobby was very clean and so were the rooms. It was great being able to have a mini fridge as well as a microwave which came in handy with to-go we had left over!

This location was perfect because we just the a few blocks from Times Square but also not stuck in all that traffic. Anything you needed was within walking distance or a quick uber ride! The staff was very warm and welcomed us a soon as we checked in| they explained all the details of our stay as well. The lobby was very clean and so were the rooms. It was great being able to have a mini fridge as well as a microwave which came in handy with to-go we had left over! Overall a great place with spacious rooms.,Sep 22| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018
Within walking distance to time square| Madison garden| top of the rock observatory| manhattan mall etc. The staff were very helpful and the room was prestine!,Sep 22| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018

It is an update hotel with a nice| open lobby. The staff was very friendly. The rooms were big (for NYC) and clean. The neighborhood felt safe but wasn't great in terms of restaurants. However| it was close to a few spots and conveniently located to get to other parts of the city. The best part of the hotel is that they have a sound wall for rooms on the 1-4th floor. It blocks out basically all street noise. I stayed on the 5th floor but still couldn't hear any street noise. I have stayed in many| many NYC hotels and can always hear street noise. i will definitely stay at this hotel again.,Sep 11| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018
The hotel is walkable to all of midtown. The room is well furnished with quality furniture that is not worn or damaged. The bed was very comfortable. The room has a refrigerator| microwave and safe| all in excellent condition. This is brobably the nicest decent priced hotel I've stayed at in NYC.Please note that rooms that don't have a street view face an old commercial building and an air shaft. If views are not important to you this shouldn't be a problem. The Rome facing the street don't have much of a view either. I will definitely stay here again.,Sep 11| 2018,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018

Hyvä hinta-laatusuhde! Huone tilava| siisti ja hyväkuntoinen| kylpyhuone mukaan lukien. Huoneessa hyvä sänky| tallelokero| jonne mahtui läppäri| silitysvälineet| jääkaappi.

Hyvä sijainti| Times Sqarelle kävelymatka ja muutaman korttelin päässä myös Penn Stationin metroasema| jonne pääsee lentokentältä suht vaivatta. Ainoa miinus oli se| että huoneen sähkölukosta oli loppunut yhtenä iltana akku enkä saanut ovea auki| mutta tämäkin asia järjestyi välittömästi| kun kerroin että minulla on kiire.

床單發現少許血跡，應該是之前客人留低的，因為夜深，翌日外出前才將要求更換牀單的紙牌按指示置於枕頭上面，當晩返回房間的時候非常失望，發現指牌已被沒收，床單卻沒有更換。另外，check-in 的時候要求一樽瓶裝水，給front desk回敬一句，酒店瓶裝水要4美元一支，我應該在外邊自行購買。收取幾百美元一晚的房租，酒店居然跟客人計較幾毛錢的一支水。,Jun 29| 2019,3,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018

Het hotel ligt in een redelijk rustige straat en aan de voorkant van onze kamer was ook nog een tussenruimte waardoor je geen last van het verkeer had. Het inchecken ging snel en bijzonder vriendelijk (man met grijze baard| weet helaas zijn naam niet meer). Hij legde alles goed uit| deed alle moeite om ons verblijf aangenaam te maken. Bijzonder was de prachtige kerstversiering in de hal| super!De kamer is niet super groot maar voldoende ruimte voor 2 personen en bagage. Bedden goed| badkamer goed. Geen douchekap. Ook goede wifi. Het eten in de Irish pub is heel goed| ontbijt hebben wij niet genomen. De locatie is prima| heel centraal. Aan de ene kant loop je een paar blokken en ben je op Times Square en ga je de andere kant heen dan kom je bij de grote winkels zoals Macy''s. Ook naar de rondvaartboten is het goed aan te lopen| ongeveer 15 minuten. Alles bij elkaar| goede locatie| vriendelijke receptie medewerkers| centraal gelegen en rustige kamers.,Feb 11| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018

ペン駅や地下鉄など交通アクセスもよく、ブロードウェイなど中心地も徒歩圏内で立地は良い。余計なサービスがない分むしろ気が楽だった。日本のビジネスホテルのような感じ。７泊して１回だけゴミが捨てられていないことがあったが、部屋自体は十分な広さで、シャワーなども快適。電子レンジ、冷蔵庫、コーヒーマシーン有り。WiFi無料。近くにセブンイレブン有。フロント対応も親切で、帰りの空港までの車の手配も完璧。次もここでいいなあと思う。,Oct 1| 2018,4,Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,326 W 37th St| New York| NY| 10018
