Staff was friendly| but the cleaning could improve. Some area were not even clean and didn’t replace paper cups that we used for coffe,Aug 17| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005
Hotel served its purpose for one night stay. Room was clean and comfortable| but our neighbors were loud. There is no valet or parking garage| but the is fee to park in a open parking lot at hotel. The only thing complimentary is coffee and the store wasn't stocked. Definitely recommend bring water and snacks.,Aug 15| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005
Property is clean. Next to freeway but quiet. Far from other hotels.. Front desk did not explain in detail that rooms would only be cleaned with 24 hour request in advance. Parking is $15 but wasn’t hard to find (should just include it in the price). Pool was closed but also not notified until arrival (okay for me but families with kids seemed disappointed). Staff is efficient but not outgoing or very friendly.,Aug 14| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005
Says free breakfast there wasn't any breakfast says indoor pool pool was out of service they should mention that before people book rooms,Aug 10| 2021,1,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005
The pool was out of service| we planned on relaxing the day we checked in| we drove 3 hours from 100  degree weather and could not enjoy our first night as planned| the manager comped us for parking and that was nice but we were looking forward to the indoor pool.,Aug 9| 2021,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005

Spacious room and in great condition. The problem is getting to hotel from SFO airport which is 10min away at any time of the day| their shuttle service to/ from airport is very limited- within 3 hour-gap early in the morning and 3 hour-gap at night. Plus hotel is very far from public transportation. Ultimately I will never stay at this hotel again because I spent more on Uber and Lyft rides.I recommend another Double Tree| not this at North location.,Aug 6| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005
I was disappointed because one of the bedsheet and pillow sheet had little blood stain on it. Bathroom had mold. If we were staying more than a night I would’ve left and go to a different hotel,Aug 5| 2021,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005
I guess for the money it was ok but will pay more and stay elsewhere next time.,Aug 5| 2021,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005
Always stay here on our trips to San Francisco. Always very clean and quiet and not to far of a drive to the city. Highly recommend,Aug 4| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005

You can never go wrong with a Double Tree from my experience. THe rooms are always clean| the beds comfy| and the staff cool.

When we were about to check in| they couldn’t find our room that we booked through Expedia. And when we showed them our confirmation email| they said they never got anything from Expedia. So we never got the room that we initially booked and they had to put us in a handicapped room. The room was okay| the bathroom smelled and the lightbulbs were out on one of the lamps| and lastly the fridge didn’t function properly.,Jul 1| 2021,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005
It had easy access to the highway.  The hot tub is included as an amenity but was closed for unspecified reasons.  The reviews said parking was free which was a huge enticement but when we checked in we were told it's $15/day ($85) that was not told in advance when factoring finances.,Jun 29| 2021,1,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005

Everything you would find at motel six. Ugly art| ugly furniture| rude staff. Even there coffee sucks. Many customers not wearing mask!. I paid for the Hilton and they delivered motel six. By the way if you decide to stay there be prepared to be charged extra! I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. And the location is terrible. There is not one convenient location for food or anything. Even the parking is terrible. They charge 15 dollars to park and the take no responsibility. I have traveled the world! This place is absolutely below any property of the Hilton I have ever stayed. I regret staying here and I will tell ever person I know.

The staff was very friendly when I arrived. There was a blue tag on the door to my room stating it had been cleaned. But when I went into my room it did not appear to have been "covid cleaned". There was residue all over the bathroom door| the shower looked like it hadn't been cleaned| there was left over trail mix on the floor next to the bed and the comforter had something black stuck to it but was covered by two thin sheets on top and bottom. No where on the site said there would be a $15 parking fee. You had to reserve a spot for the gym or pool which is understandable during covid. Overall was very disappointed in how market their cleanliness when a 5 year would have done a better job. The front desk staff was friendly though.

The staff lady was not patient or welcoming. She seemed disappointed that we did not book with Hilton directly. We had paid breakfast included with our stay and she replied that the restaurant had been closed for sometime and did not offered the box lunches that were specified in the reservation. Once we insisted she gave us the box lunches. The hotel room was old and with a noisy air conditioner.,Mar 20| 2021,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005

My toilet did not flush properly| would have to flush teice. The toilet water would run all night and I would have to lift the tanks to stop it from running. When we arrived the toilet had hair on it. The tub did not drain while water was running and I would stand in a pool of water while showering.The location of the hotel was beautiful. It was in the bay.,Mar 29| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005

The hotel was o.k. Kind of hard to find. No microwave in the rooms. You would think since the pandemic it would have one. They had one in the lobby for everyone to use.

They advertise a restaurant and bar near the lobby but it was closed down. Along with all of their amenities.

I was informed that there is restaurant but it was closed 9 months ago so I have to drive to pick up for Dinner at New Year’s Eve.

First going to start with the positive of this hotel. Great room| comfortable bed| extra clean room specially during COVID.The 1 star comes from the rude female receptionist| unfriendly and unwelcoming. Never thought somebody like that would qualify to work at a Hilton. Another reason is because we paid for a bay view and we were given a room on the 5th floor out of 8th with tree views not the bay which is what we paid for. In addition| the hotel requires you to pay $15 for parking when they have plenty of space to park.Also.... no airport shuttle.,Dec 28| 2020,1,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005

We booked this hotel so we could stay near the San Francisco airport since our flight to Cancun was early in the morning. The staff at that hotel are not friendly at all. They do not make you feel welcome. We were tired and we went to bed I was laying down on the bed and my youngest son screamed and said there was a bug crawling on my bed. I immediately got up and it was a bug crawling on my sheet. I took a picture of the bug and I went on google and the bug was in fact a bed bug! I was so disgusted because me and my family have never experienced anything like this and we never expected this from this hotel. I immediately got up and talked to the hotel staff about it and the guy that was there looked at me as if it was nothing bad. He don’t even apologize about it. He was just staring at me so I told that I was not going to have my family stay in that room. So he then switched our room and we had to move all of our belongings to another room late at night. We will never go back to that hotel.

I finally had to go down to the front desk at 11pm and wait while someone found the items. The location is near the freeway| but there is no place to eat nearby. The hotel was clean.,Sep 23| 2020,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005

Nothing| my room that i had booked through expedia was not given to me.  The hotel stated that booking through expedia or 3rd party you wont get the room you booked.

Hotel is nice| decent enough area although going to anything on the other side of the freeway is a little inconvenient but not unmanageable. When we first checked in we were given a room on the second floor| smelled musty| toilet water low| dead bugs in the bath tub and no covid measures stated... went downstairs and explained it to the concierge. He apologized and gave us a different room on the 3rd floor. Much nicer| smelled clean| had a clean seal sticker on door when we entered and a stack of wet wipes for hands by the tv. Very happen and felt safe in the 3rd floor room so no direct complaints as the original issue was easily resolved.,Sep 7| 2020,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005

We had a group of workers stay here for a duration of two months and they charge 15 a night per vehicle to park.  One of our trucks were broken into while parked inside their lot| I called them and they said they do not provide secured parking or a security walk around.

Booked a room with a bay view and was disappointed. The rooms are dark and the view is minimal. Walls are super thin.  First we had an issue with hearing the elevators. After arguing with the staff to be moved to another room| during which we were told the hotel was full only to find out later than multiple floors were currently unfilled| we were offered a lesser accommodation without a view or  refund. After further negotiation|  we were given a equal accommodation| but we could hear the couple in the room next to us talking and having sex all night because the walls are so thin. We were then woken up at 6:00 am by the sound of trucks backing up at the construction site next door. When checking out early the manager attempted to get us to stay by offering us an entire for to ourselves with anything we needed.

At check-in we were not greeted with a friendly staff|  didn't engage in conversation.  All she talked about with the guest before me was about Covid-19 and how she felt about it| nothing about the hotel at all. The hallway in the guestrooms smelled like skunk. The sheets and comforters were old| replacement needed. There were no iron| microwave or blowdryer. We left a message at the front desk but never returned our call. Saw a few housekeepers and they were so aloof. We asked for coffee cups at the front desk and the agent gave us unwrapped cups and didn't give us lids 😕 the following day| we asked for cups again| this time the male front desk agent was nicer| he let us get the cups ourselves. We checked out at 4am| the agent was busy putting some bottled waters in brown bag (we didn't get that welcome bag) and when I told her that I was checking out| she said ok we'll just email you the receipt| like I was a bother for interrupting what she was doing.

I understand that we are in this new corvid-19 situation but 1. I booked a king suite for my family and I ...but when checking in the front desk person told me they were out of the suite rooms.  She blamed it on 3rd party booking but I checked with Double Trees website and it still had those rooms available.2.  While I was checking in a security guard came to the front desk| chatted with the front desk clerk.  The clerk asked the security guard to wear his mask and the guard  proceeded to use profanity about not wearing a mask???!!!  Right in front me!3.

The parking lot was full of garbage| cans of beer! it literally felt I was at a tailgate party!I will not be staying at this Hilton Hotel again!,May 2| 2020,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005
With Covid-19| one would think the hotel rooms would be cleaned/sanitized properly. My husband and I| wiped everything down with Lysol| as we usually do wherever we stay| and found the towel filthy brown from dust and what not. Took the towel to front desk and let my concern be known.As a result| we will no longer stay at this hotel.,Apr 19| 2020,1,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005

The check-in was HORRIBLE!! The lady named Stella treated us super bad and didn’t give us the attention we needed after traveling 12 hours by car. She needs to know how to treat the guests better| it was definitely a really bad experience for me and my family. That’s sad because a famous hotel like the Hilton company| I believe they should select better their employees.,Mar 9| 2020,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005

A pet peeve of mine is when a hotel| out in the middle of nowhere| has the audacity to charge for parking. You have a huge parking lot| there are NO other options around| and to charge $15 is PURE GREED. I made sure to tell them that Hotels.com lists this property as free parking- so they had no foot to stand on and I was able to stop the charge before it was even applied. There should be a law against this at ANY hotel.Room was fine- very close to airport| but I will NEVER stay here again on principle alone.,Feb 25| 2020,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005

The room only had a below window HVAC unit. We needed the heat. It was noise and had to cycle about every 20 minutes...all night long. The wife liked the white noise| not me.

We had a great one night stay! Room was very clean| bed was comfortable| staff was friendly. The restaurant had delicious food (especially the cali-quinoa salad!). We used the gym for the first time ever at a hotel. It was small but had everything we needed. The pool was out of order but not a big deal. The only thing I hope they add in the future is a fan in the bathroom! It was always very warm in there| especially after showering. The hotel is very close to the highway which was super convenient.

Not happy about anything regarding my stay.I drove all the way from Canada| for 15-16 hours straight on the road. I booked the hotel 2-3 hours before i got there. There were 3-4 adults| I ordered a room with 2 queen beds. I get there and they give me my room| I go upstairs and guess what| only 1 bed and the best part is the front staff didn't even tell me| so thanks for that!I go downstairs and tell them I had two queen beds and they said "oh sorry we sold out and don't have that room available. I am very disappointed| I was extremely tired from driving for all those hours and I would have loved to sleep on my own bed except I had to sleep on a single bed that they drag in from who knows where.This was my first and definitely last time that I will be going to a Hilton owned hotel.

When we walked in the man in the front desk was very kind and polite. However once we got into our room we noticed how dusty the furniture was. The table/ cabinet next to the bed was sooooo dusty you could see it. Next at night when I was about ready to get to bed I noticed a stain on our comforter. The towels didnt smell clean but a stuffy weird smell. And at night the women who was at the front desk very rude treated us as if we werent guest. When checking out they told us breakdfast was only served until 10 but online said 11 not sure if they just didnt want to take us because it was 10:30.,Sep 19| 2019,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005

I was a very nice place to stay. No ocean views but a nice quiet place to relax and SF is only a few miles away.  Plus Free Parking!,Sep 16| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005

We had a clean room. One of the beds was uncomfortable. Staff was very friendly. Tub did not drain really good. We would definitely stay here again. Cookies were amazing as usual!,Sep 20| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005
When we walked in the man in the front desk was very kind and polite. However once we got into our room we noticed how dusty the furniture was. The table/ cabinet next to the bed was sooooo dusty you could see it. Next at night when I was about ready to get to bed I noticed a stain on our comforter. The towels didnt smell clean but a stuffy weird smell. And at night the women who was at the front desk very rude treated us as if we werent guest. When checking out they told us breakdfast was only served until 10 but online said 11 not sure if they just didnt want to take us because it was 10:30.,Sep 19| 2019,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005

Really frustrating. I called ahead to include parking| got a reservation agent who said they had added it and I wouldn’t be charged. Then when I came with a 3 year old to check in they told me they wouldn’t honor that and charged me for the 3 days I left my car. They did say I could cancel without penalty| which was a bit ridiculous given the 3 year old and late time of night. Couldn’t believe the poor customer service. I wont choose to stay at this brand hotel again. They acknowledged three people had said the same thing but wouldn’t honor what I had been told on the phone.,Sep 8| 2019,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005
The picture and the property were two different things !

The overall stay was good.  My only complaint is that the coffee bar (free coffee) was only open until 8. I don't remember seeing anything that stated the coffee bar's hours. Thankfully the cleaning staff gave me another cup and creamer for the coffee in my room.,Jul 6| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005
The hotel was great and the room was spacious. Access to highway was great. Other than the hotel restaurant you need to travel a bit for restaurant options. Brisbane had some great options though if you are OK with driving 10 minutes or so.,Jul 5| 2019,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005
It is a decent hotel| and I have stayed here twice now... No complaints as such| but maybe the staff could be friendlier!,Jul 4| 2019,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005

Room was nice big and clean. Loved that they offered free water and coffee and day long. Although the buffet was a little pricey it was worth it with the  variety food.

The DoubleTree by Hilton was the worst customer service ever. We found bedbugs an actual bedbug and my wife was left with bites and the front desk couldn't do anything because the manager was not in. Then they had the technician change his story and say that the bug he confirmed was a bedbug| was a woodchip. Very poorly managed and sneaky! I had to throw away all my belongings and they could not even give me half off my stay. They are liars I have pictures of everything so think twice before staying here.,Jun 23| 2019,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005
The property was confusing to get to at night from the freeway. Parking was not available at the site and had to park at the overflow parking. Rooms were very dark and lighting was not enough during the night. Overall experience was not at Doubletree quality.,Jun 23| 2019,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005

Great hotel but an odd area. Gas stations| restaurants| etc are all a few mile drive. It looks closer on the map| but because of the roads and exits| its at least 10-15min to get to gas station! And considering that there is very limited parking at the hotel (it took me about 10-15min to get a spot and also saw others complaining the next night) - it is difficult to leave since you may give up your parking space. The room and staff were great though. If you are visiting a business in that area or not driving/renting a car - its a great property.,Jun 20| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005

Terrible service| dirty hotel| deteriorating conditions.  They boast of their easy and convenient airport shuttle| which was anything but.  It took the shuttle over 40 minutes to pick  us up.  Once the driver arrived| he lied and said the back door to the van was broken and that we would have to lug our own luggage up the three stairs and figure out where to accommodate them within a narrow space.  Please note| every other shuttle service had a driver that was helping passengers accommodate their luggage| especially larger suitcases.  Once we arrived at the first hotel drop off| we switched drivers and the very nice female over immediately opened up the doors to the back of the van and miraculously was helping passengers store luggage.  I reported this to the hotel upon my arrival| no one cared.  The elevator doors and property in general is run down and dirty| my room smelled of mildew and the shower was not clean.  All my issues were reported and not a apology| extra cookie| NOTHING because they don’t seem to give a darn about their customer.

Room service was extremely rude. They didn’t answer all night into the morning and I eventually had to call the front desk. Front desk said she would have them call me and they never did. I ordered two drinks and never got them and the food from breakfast arrived cold. When I finally got ahold of them| they were very nonchalant and aggressive. “What else you want?”. I was hung up on twice instead of saying goodbye when I was done talking.,Feb 18| 2019,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005

Room service was extremely rude. They didn’t answer all night into the morning and I eventually had to call the front desk. Front desk said she would have them call me and they never did. I ordered two drinks and never got them and the food from breakfast arrived cold. When I finally got ahold of them| they were very nonchalant and aggressive. “What else you want?”. I was hung up on twice instead of saying goodbye when I was done talking.,Feb 18| 2019,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005

I had reserved 1 king bed suite| checked in at 9:30PM& got our keys to the room and got 2 double beds. Called front desk and got the right room| it was 10PM by then| I could’ve been resting after a long drive. Next night| I was woken up at 2AM from a phonecall from the front desk| when I answered it| it was just the dial tone. 3-5 minutes later there was a knock at my door. Looked at the peephole and no one was there. Turns out| nextdoor was complaining about the tv volume which was at a 10. I have sleeping issues and in order to sleep| I need noise in the background. Mind you| this was our last night at the hotel. Lost my good nights rest because walls are too thin| not my fault. At 1AM| I could hear children screaming and yelling.

There is a nice walking path along the water very close.,Nov 20| 2018,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005

The hotel was quite small and pretty good location| right next to 101 N freeway. The staff were friendly. However| the bedrooms where not clean as I expected. The blankets had stains all over about 5 spots| and they were pretty visible. They beds and pillows had little bit stinky smell to it. The desks and drawers had little bit of dust on them. The carpet barely vacuumed| we would go back to our room to only the bathroom cleaned little bit and our beds made. The carpet wouldn’t be vacuumed nor the desks were cleaned from the dust. The buildings and room were pretty nice looking. But one thing that turned it off for me for sure is the uncleaned and u sanitary beds.,Aug 19| 2018,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005

Even though it's very close to the freeway| it was quite . The staff was very friendly and helpful. Nice bar and restaurant .,Aug 18| 2018,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005

Overall is good. The place is quiet. I don't see many people in this area. Parking is $15. However| the parking lot is not covered or patrolled. I am not a big fan of this.

Hotellin oma parkkipaikka oli täynnä. Varaparkki oli viereisessä korttelissa. Huoneessa ei ollut lisävuodetta| vaikka varauksessa oli 1 aikuinen ja 16- ja 9-vuotiaat lapset. Lisävuode tuli kyllä ripeästi| kun asiasta ilmoitti respaan. Sisäänkirjauksessa varatut huoneet ilmeisesti vaihtuivat keskenään. Huomasimme sen| kun WiFi-kirjautuminen toimi ristikkäisillä tunnuksilla. Toisen huoneen vessa vuoti läpi. Tämäkin korjaantui nopeasti ilmoituksen jälkeen. Iso plussa oli| että respassa oltiin avuliaita. Virkailija soitti mm. puhelintilauksen pizzeriaan| josta toimitettiin tilaus hotellin aulaan. Toinen plussa oli| että lasten buffet-aamiaisesta ei veloitettu.,Jul 10| 2019,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Francisco Airport North,5000 Sierra Point Pkwy| Brisbane| CA| 94005
