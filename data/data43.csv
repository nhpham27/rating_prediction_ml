This hotel was amazing. Right on Chinatown and cross the street from the metro station so easy to go around. The rooms are a little small but staff were so nice and the rooms were clean. They also have a rooftop| restaurant and a bar that plays live music sometimes. One of the best hotel I been and will stay there again.,Aug 16| 2021,5,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001

location was perfect| just a few blocks from the national mall and surrounded by great restaurants (farmers and distillers and jaleo were favorites of my partner and i). room was quite small but worked fine for what i needed and the price couldn‚Äôt be beat for the quality. staff was perfect and went above and beyond.,Aug 14| 2021,5,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001

I only needed a one night stay and researched online. I chose Motto because of the price and location. I read reviews and people had complained about the lack of parking. Since I came up on the train it wasn‚Äôt an issue. I also read reviews about lack of cleanliness but I found the room and hotel to be very clean; no dust in the corners| no soap scum. It was tiny but I expected that. I didn‚Äôt need a room to hang out in  because I had things to do in DC. It was a place to sleep and take a shower and it met my needs. I had dinner in the restaurant on the lobby level and it was great. The rooftop bar had stunning views and was a lot of fun. The staff from the front desk to the bartenders were lovely and most friendly. Key cards were needed to gain access to the elevators so I felt safe. Not a good view from my room but it didn‚Äôt matter to me. I would definitely stay here again but the little bunk bed room would not be a place to hang out unless you want to stay in bed and watch tv| in which case would be very comfortable. I slept well and heard nothing from any other room or in he hall as I was on the end Totally met my needs.,Aug 1| 2021,5,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001

The rooms are small but also cute and comfortable. The hotel is in a great location| the subway is across the street| there is a Walgreens around the corner and good restaurants in the area. The restaurant inside the hotel is pretty good too. Also they have a small coffee shop that is open in the mornings. I stayed for 4 days with my 10 yr old daughter and we have no complaints. The only downside was that there are homeless people on that street| But it still felt safe. I always notice police officers in the area. My daughter and I loved our stay.,Jul 28| 2021,4,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001
We really enjoyed our stay at Motto in DC. It was close enough to the things we wanted to do that we could walk| and right next to a metro station. On the down side| parking for 3 days in the recommended facility across the street cost $75 extra dollars.,Jul 26| 2021,5,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001

The room was super small| but that is the brand. So just make sure you know that this is the type of room you're booking. The are is great- across from Metro-- but also the area is super loud; they give you ear plugs in your room.

The only thing that could be better is if breakfast would be included.,Jun 30| 2021,5,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001
We loved the small efficient rooms well-located near transportation and convenient dining. Staff was first-rate. Place was very clean and friendly. Will stay again.,Jun 30| 2021,5,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001
Brooke & Ysabel made us feel so welcomed as we checked in and in fact| greeted us with a smile as we come in and out of the building.  They looked after our luggage after check out to have a few more last minute stroll in the area on our last day. The hotel itself has a modern| new and clean ambiance.  We were able to enjoy the great coffee and great service at the Crimson Cafe and also enjoyed the view till sunset at the Penthouse.  We highly recommend Motto and will come back to this same location| which was close to the Metro Station as well.  Our stay was very memorable because we made a good choice for our hotel.  Thanks to all the amazing staff esp at the front desk!,Jun 29| 2021,5,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001

Service could not be more amazing. Rooms were small| but well designed and efficient. Everything felt new and clean. Rachel at the front desk was awesome.  Conveniently across the street from the Gallery Place/China Town metro. Two stops from Union Station| if you take the Amtrak in. A conveyor belt sushi place is across the street. Most of DC| now that the police have been defunded| is pretty sketchy these days| but this area especially so. You have to use your room key to even get into the lobby - but we appreciated this safety feature when we found we had to scoot back in because a ranting and shouting character was coming down the street. Again| this is pretty much what you're finding throughout the city and not just in this area| so not a mark against Motto. Crimson Whiskey Bar is in the basement| and we ate in rather than venture out at night. China Town of today is very different from a decade ago. Some good Chinese restaurants| but only found a single Chinese retail store where there used to be dozens - along with grocery stores| meat markets and Chinese medicinal stores. Very sad to see the evolution.  Don't stay here for a China Town experience| that no longer exists| however| it's proximity to other attractions is great.

I loved my stay at the Motto by Hilton. For any young women who would like a clean and secure place to stay in the DC area| I would highly recommend the Motto. You need a key card to enter the hotel and the card will only allow you to go to your own floor. I felt super safe! The staff is very patient| helpful| and kind. The rooms are small (thus the lower price tag) but they are very clean and up to date. The fitness room is also very nice: Variety of cardio machines| cables|  couple benches| and dumbbells.

I loved my stay at the Motto by Hilton. For any young women who would like a clean and secure place to stay in the DC area| I would highly recommend the Motto. You need a key card to enter the hotel and the card will only allow you to go to your own floor. I felt super safe! The staff is very patient| helpful| and kind. The rooms are small (thus the lower price tag) but they are very clean and up to date. The fitness room is also very nice: Variety of cardio machines| cables|  couple benches| and dumbbells. If I come back| I would definitely stay again!,May 10| 2021,5,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001

Very cozy place to stay the rooms were pretty small| but it was nice and cozy. The rooms were very clean and the bed was super comfy.

John at the front desk was awesome. Would def recommend if you are looking for a quick stay. Rooms are smaller than usual but clean and efficient.

I love this hotel and used to stay here when it was POD.  My only complaints are that there should be a clearly communicated plan for regular trash pickup since room cleaning is by request only.

I spent one night after my shift at the Hospital. Everything was awesome. I asked for a quiet room to have a good night of sleep and they offered me a perfect one! The staff is friendly and helpful. Everything was really clean. The location is amazing specially considering the price for the room. Room is very comfortable and exactly as described. It‚Äôs a micro hotel| therefore it is expected that the rooms are very small.

Hotel is in a great location of Chinatown to access all the great things that DC has to offer. Rooms are pod style so VERY SMALL.

Once in the room - I felt okay! But outside the property it‚Äôs scary - thugs| drug dealers| and homeless hanging out everywhere! If I was in DC for a longer stay I would‚Äôve gone elsewhere regardless of price! But I was only in DC overnight - flying back out after a morning meeting! Just a really bad part of town!,Oct 1| 2020,3,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001
Hotel was clean and room was comfortable but too small and too tight of a space. This was our first| and probably last| endeavor in a "pod" hotel. Did not like proximity to bathroom| no coffee maker in room and the noise on the street in Chinatown makes this a not so attractive location in DC.

Once in the room - I felt okay! But outside the property it‚Äôs scary - thugs| drug dealers| and homeless hanging out everywhere! If I was in DC for a longer stay I would‚Äôve gone elsewhere regardless of price! But I was only in DC overnight - flying back out after a morning meeting! Just a really bad part of town!,Oct 1| 2020,3,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001
Hotel was clean and room was comfortable but too small and too tight of a space. This was our first| and probably last| endeavor in a "pod" hotel. Did not like proximity to bathroom| no coffee maker in room and the noise on the street in Chinatown makes this a not so attractive location in DC. Will look in another part of town with a "regular" amenities hotel.,Sep 29| 2020,3,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001

Convenient hotel with nice bars and close to all the action in DC.,Feb 10| 2020,5,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001
Customer service and room was straight forward and very pleasing. Hotel is located in a good area - we were able to walk everywhere and rent bikes/scooters if needed. The diner/bar attached was open to the public so its atmosphere felt more inviting than most exclusive hotel bars. In all| it was nice to come back to a clean| comfortable| modern room after exploring the town all day.,Feb 10| 2020,5,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001

Pod provides everything you need in a hotel| and lowers the price by opting out on the things that you don't. The rooms are smaller| the toiletries are dispensable| and there is generally less space| BUT| I found that I didn't miss the things I see in traditional hotels. The designers of the hotel were clever in their choice of how to make the room smaller| but not cramped. Additionally| Pod had the best customer service in recent memory. The staff was extremely helpful and kind| even calling the room after we checked in to make sure we settled in alright. Located in Chinatown with the a metro station in sight of the front door of the hotel| Pod close to anything in the DC area. The location  is also prime since Chinatown doesn't "turn off" around 6 pm as many parts of DC do; the nightlife and many restaurants around the hotel make for an excellent stay.I will definitely consider Pod again| especially for shorter stays. If you're curious| I would try it out to see if you like it!,Jan 2| 2020,5,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001

The only negative  thing I would say is| I wouldnt recommend it to non couples as the lack of space course calls for a certain level of comfort.

My mother and I stayed in the bunk beds. The room was noisy but they tried to help with a noise machine and ear plugs. Clean| convenient location.

I enjoyed my stay. The hotel is new and in good condition| a green building. The staff was friendly and helpful. The roof bar was crowded with young locals| making it less than receptive for a solo business traveler| but it was Friday night.The rooms are VERY small. I would not have been pleased to have to be there as a couple. There was no place to leave the my luggage but in the middle of the floor next to the bed| a tripping hazard. There was no coffee offered in or with the room. The room was not sound-proof; noise from the hall and other room is an issue they acknowledged with a pair of earplugs on the night stand.I liked the location| right in the center of things| with cafes and stores nearby.

A nice little hotel in Chinatown. The sign for it is fairly high up so it‚Äôs easy to miss if you‚Äôre walking on the same side of the street as the hotel. The bunk beds in the room were a great use of space but still large enough to accommodate a normal sized adult. The noise from the construction work going on in or around the hotel wasn‚Äôt ideal but I assume that‚Äôs temporary. My only real complaint was the pillows which were thin and didn‚Äôt provide enough neck support for a side sleeper like myself. Overall I would consider the POD for a future stay in DC.,Oct 12| 2019,4,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001

It‚Äôs just what you need. Clean room and bath| excellent location| great price. Metro is adjacent to the front door.

This is a well placed hotel and the staff is really nice. However the room was very small| it had little storage space| and most of all| the toiled was basically next to the bed| and not properly isolated or ventilated. I traveled by myself| but it would have been difficult to share the room with someone else| there is little privacy in the restroom if there's more than one person in the room.,Sep 6| 2019,3,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001
The hotel was nice and the staff was very good. My only complaint is that the rooms were extremely noisy in regards to letting in street noise. The hotel had ear plugs waiting for us in the room and while it‚Äôs a nice gesture we would prefer to have a quiet room and not have to wear earplugs to try to get a restful nights sleep.,Sep 2| 2019,3,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001
This is a nice| clean modern hotel in the ‚ÄúEuropean‚Äù vein (shower only| no mini fridge| just the basics). It is in an excellent location right across the street from the metro with some of the friendliest staff ever. I highly recommend it. The main downside is that it is so close to the arena that the cheering crowd and drum line was very loud...but| the room came with ear plugs and a white noise machine| so they‚Äôre trying.,Sep 2| 2019,4,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001

Great location and price.  Just enough room and features in the room.  Loved the options for blue tooth speakers and HDMI connection to TV.  Doug and others at front desk were wonderful.  On the downside| the USB ports didn't work in my room.  I'd also like to be able to get hot water to make tea.

Loved our stay here! Staff was more than wonderful and extremely friendly. The location was great| easy enough to walk to and from food and attractions| and even EASIER to scoot/bike. The rooms lived up to their name as far as size| a little cramped for two| but considering we spent most of our time out and about it fit our needs perfectly! Not to mention| it was stunning. We enjoyed the rooftop bar attached and got EXCELLENT service from the bartender who ended up giving us tons of great local favorites to check out. By far the most noteable part of the trip was the ability to stow our suitcases after check out. Not many hotels would offer this and it gave us the opportunity to explore the city for a few extra hours before our evening flight! Couldn‚Äôt reccomend it enough.,Jul 14| 2019,5,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001

We loved our stay at the POD! My friend and I were in town for a concert. The hotel is directly across from the Metro and right down the street from the Capital One Arena. The staff was extremely helpful and respectful| even refusing to share the elevator with us| even though we insisted| because it was our vacation and they felt we should be left alone. We ate and had drinks at all three restaurants/bars| with each being great in their own way. The room was exactly what we needed. Everything was exceptionally clean and well thought out| including the noise machine and earplugs (which we didn't need- it was super quiet). We absolutely loved it and can't wait to stay at the POD again!,Jul 13| 2019,5,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001

Cool| modern hotel. Friendly staff. Great location| especially for the Convention Center and Chinatown area. Only downside is that the rooms are quite small.

The hotel is in a fantastic location and right across the street from the metro. It has a wonderful whisky bar and a rooftop bar (with a view) that you must check out. The room| however| is extremely small. It's so small that there isn't anywhere to comfortably put your suitcase and still have room to walk around. The rooms are really cute though| if you're ok with a dormitory/artsy room. So| overall| it was a really good stay. The location and the amenities are worth the trade-off if you can pack really lightly and if you're ok with a firm bed.,May 29| 2019,4,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001

The room| however| is extremely small. It's so small that there isn't anywhere to comfortably put your suitcase and still have room to walk around. The rooms are really cute though| if you're ok with a dormitory/artsy room. So| overall| it was a really good stay. The location and the amenities are worth the trade-off if you can pack really lightly and if you're ok with a firm bed.,May 29| 2019,4,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001

The rooms are TINY| but well kept.  I was fine with it and the location| but my wife not so much.  The staff were some of the best I've met anywhere and I travel for a living.  The location was so good we never took the metro to the local attractions and splurged on Lyfts for the rest.  DCA is <15 min away by taxi and the mall is ~10 walking.  I'd definitely stay again| my wife may convince me otherwise.,May 22| 2019,4,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001
The Good:Hotel was very clean and loved the modern ambiance. Most of the staff were friendly. Enjoyed the fitness room. Location was great| in the heart of Chinatown with lots of places to eat within walking distance. And right across the street from the Metro station. The hotel shares its property with a cafe| restaurant| and 3 very cool bars (whiskey bar is awesome!)The Bad:Rooms were tinier than tiny (POD)| but that's what we signed up for| right? Literally just enough space to walk around the bed. No place to put a large luggage bag so I laid it on the desk which was smaller than my bag. Water pressure in the showers could be better| and the liquid pumps they use for shower shampoo/conditioner/soup were very weak with just a drop coming out with each pump. No ice machines?!? If you want a bucket of ice| you have to go to the cafe in the lobby floor. Good luck with them having a bucket for you....they were out so I had to carry 3 plastic cups of ice back to my room. And the employees at the cafe don't work for the hotel so they act irritated that they have to do something free for you as a hotel guest. Lastly| most of the staff is friendly| with the exception of the older white guy working alone late/overnight....won't go into details. All in all a positive experience| but all the little things mentioned do add up. I was there during a busy DC week so this hotel had the best deal in my price range. Not sure if I'd stay here again if prices elsewhere were better.,May 21| 2019,4,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001

I met my college aged daughter in DC for a few days during her spring break. We wanted some place modern and stylish and centrally located which wouldn't break the budget. POD checked all three boxes! We enjoyed walking everywhere after having great cappuccinos downstairs in the lobby cafe. The proximity to the Smithsonian Portrait Gallery was just a couple of blocks| and the surrounding Chinatown had great meal options.

Great place if you're staying in DC for a quick trip! We had a full pod| and it was tight quarters but definitely do-able if you're not going to be in your room| much. There is no microwave or mini fridge in-room| which I didn't think to check before coming. So I couldn't save any leftovers from the delicious restaurants in Chinatown!,May 20| 2019,4,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001

What I didn't like:  motel-quality towels| poor lighting at the sink| and no soap/lotion.  shampoo/body wash/conditioner came out in small dollops and were attached to the wall.

POD is ok but don't stay there if you want to sleep.The rooms are tiny and so noisy that they need a white noise machine and ear plugs in each room just to keep patrons from jumping out the window.It's loud out there - cars screeching| people screaming| etc.  Admittedly - the White noise machine WORKS WELL and I used it ever night.I could still hear the occasional doors slamming in the hallway.Rooms are postage stamps.  But the beds are comfortable and the big screen TV is nice.  Also| I never heard my neighbours at all (unless they were coming in or out)...Service is AMAZING.  One of the best I can remember in a hotel. And this is their saving grace.  Nice breakfast place in the lobby and SUPER cool Whisky bar in the basement.  Fantastic area - walk to everything including the convention center.No shortage of weirdos around.,May 10| 2019,3,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001

At first I was a little shocked at the size of the room| but quickly adapted. Pods has everything you need when you visit a busy city and you are around and about. The price I paid through Expedia was great| but other paid extremely alot for the space and facing a wall through you window.,Apr 20| 2019,5,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001

Stayed for a couples vacation in DC. The hotel was surrounded by great restaurants and a solid mix of transportation options. I only wish I reserved a queen instead a full.

These rooms are far smaller than a regular hotel (super 8| Marriott) ‚Äî but  I don‚Äôt plan to stay in my room a lot. It has everything you need Dash a bed| a bathroom| a TV| a mirror| a closet| a tiny desk. No extra chairs| no dresser| No fridge| no coffee maker. It‚Äôs just a basic room| but it‚Äôs spotless. The location is half a block from the metro. It‚Äôs less expensive| and therefore it‚Äôs a perfect option. Will stay again.,Feb 22| 2019,5,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001

When we checked in the hotel was out of the type of room we researched but upgraded us and gave us free breakfast tokens at no additional cost! The hotel was quiet and clean. We will be visiting again!,Feb 23| 2019,5,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001

These rooms are far smaller than a regular hotel (super 8| Marriott) ‚Äî but  I don‚Äôt plan to stay in my room a lot. It has everything you need Dash a bed| a bathroom| a TV| a mirror| a closet| a tiny desk. No extra chairs| no dresser| No fridge| no coffee maker. It‚Äôs just a basic room| but it‚Äôs spotless. The location is half a block from the metro. It‚Äôs less expensive| and therefore it‚Äôs a perfect option. Will stay again.,Feb 22| 2019,5,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001
Great Hotel! They are small rooms but we were not in the room long and at a great price it made since to stay here. Close to about everything and across the street from the metro station. Great people who work the front desk and felt welcomed every time we entered the door.,Feb 22| 2019,5,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001

POD| DC is close to great eating and shops. I knew space would be on the smaller side| but it was quite tight; not much place to put luggage/clothing.

Modern property| efficient| didn‚Äôt feel too cramped for one person for an extended trip (7 nights). Missed having a refrigerator but not a big deal. I agree with other reviewers that the street noise is loud| even with the window closed| my room on the 6th floor faced the street. Sirens| drunk people yelling| crazy people yelling| buses| trucks. I was on a conference call and people could hear the background noise. The yelling was worst from midnight to 2 am and was not fun. They provide an adjustable white noise machine in the room next to the bed but I found it to be too loud. Not a lot of large flat surfaces and the one table was tiny but did fit my laptop and power outlets were right there. There were other clever ways of providing flat space that surprisingly fit all my stuff: window sill| top of the heater| ledge under the TV| and a 3-tier small built-in shelf thing. Very good WiFi. Apart from the noise| excellent location centrally located in Chinatown with many Chinese and non-Chinese restaurant choices nearby| Walgreens and CVS. Across the street from the subway station| which is served by the red line that provides direct access to Union Station (good for coming from BWI) and the yellow line that goes direct to DCA airport. And it‚Äôs one stop to the Convention Center which was a bonus.,Jan 19| 2019,5,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001
The Pod is a nice| affordable place or a quick| in-and-out business trip. The neighborhood gets a bit funky during the day and crowded at night.  The rooms are very small but nice enough.

Modern property| efficient| didn‚Äôt feel too cramped for one person for an extended trip (7 nights). Missed having a refrigerator but not a big deal. I agree with other reviewers that the street noise is loud| even with the window closed| my room on the 6th floor faced the street. Sirens| drunk people yelling| crazy people yelling| buses| trucks. I was on a conference call and people could hear the background noise. The yelling was worst from midnight to 2 am and was not fun. They provide an adjustable white noise machine in the room next to the bed but I found it to be too loud. Not a lot of large flat surfaces and the one table was tiny but did fit my laptop and power outlets were right there. There were other clever ways of providing flat space that surprisingly fit all my stuff: window sill| top of the heater| ledge under the TV| and a 3-tier small built-in shelf thing. Very good WiFi. Apart from the noise| excellent location centrally located in Chinatown with many Chinese and non-Chinese restaurant choices nearby| Walgreens and CVS. Across the street from the subway station| which is served by the red line that provides direct access to Union Station (good for coming from BWI) and the yellow line that goes direct to DCA airport. And it‚Äôs one stop to the Convention Center which was a bonus.,Jan 19| 2019,5,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001
The Pod is a nice| affordable place or a quick| in-and-out business trip. The neighborhood gets a bit funky during the day and crowded at night.  The rooms are very small but nice enough.

Checking was a breeze| unit was clean so that was good. However the room is small. So small that you have about 1 ft around the bed to walk. If there are 2 people| you can not pass by and someone would need to get on the bed while the other walks by. I don‚Äôt mind small but this is just too tight. The worst thing about the place is that starting about 8 in the morning housekeeping starts knocking on the door repeatedly about every half hour. I am guessing they want to see what time you are leaving but you can imagine how annoying it is to have someone waking you up just as you get back to sleep-for no reason!

Otherwise it was clean| staff was very friendly and helpful| and the location was great. We walked to several establishments nearby and there was a nice rooftop bar at the hotel.

We stayed here since we were watching a concert at the capital one arena. The location is perfect in Chinatown literally a block down from the capital one arena.

I rented two rooms at the POD hotel due to its proximity to the Capital One arena| and for the pretty cheap prices I'd gotten for it in comparison to other hotels nearby. Honestly| I wasn't expecting much but I was very pleased with the ease accessibility| quality of the rooms| sparkling cleanliness| and how very pleasant the staff were. Bonus: there's an awesome restaurant| coffee shop| and bar right in the lobby which feel far less generic and higher quality than most hotel offerings. If you're a light sleeper| bring earplugs - the sirens from the nearby fire station will wake you.

I rented two rooms at the POD hotel due to its proximity to the Capital One arena| and for the pretty cheap prices I'd gotten for it in comparison to other hotels nearby. Honestly| I wasn't expecting much but I was very pleased with the ease accessibility| quality of the rooms| sparkling cleanliness| and how very pleasant the staff were. Bonus: there's an awesome restaurant| coffee shop| and bar right in the lobby which feel far less generic and higher quality than most hotel offerings. If you're a light sleeper| bring earplugs - the sirens from the nearby fire station will wake you. I'll definitely be recommending this place to others| and will revisit it myself.,Nov 29| 2018,5,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001

Great hotel for seeing DC. Rooms are light| clean and well-equipped.If you're a light sleeper| ask for a quieter room on the upper floors. Rooms on the 4th and 5th floors are able to hear the street noise| but it's only a problem if you're a light sleeper and not used to living in cities. The hotel provides earplugs and a white-noise machine to help you sleep too.Wifi was great| no problems with streaming. Staff really friendly and welcoming. Really like the media hub in the rooms too - makes it super easy to connect your own HDMI device (e.g chromecast) to the TV.All in all| a great stay for a short city break!,Nov 21| 2018,4,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001

I love that #podlife! I always stayed at the Pod39 in NYC| so I was delighted to find out there was a DC version opening and it did not disappoint! It checks all the boxes for easy| chic and affordable business travel. Rooms are clean| chic| thoughtfully appointed and efficient. Great rooftop bar for the fairer seasons| a good year-round whiskey bar basement with plenty of space| and wonderful all-day diner for breakfasts| dinners and more. I usually take my first and last meetings of the day in the coffee shop and diner or bar| and it's nice because I can drop off my work bag easily while I'm at it.

Love the extra blanket- super soft blue velvety goodness| and the shampoo + conditioner results in a great hair day (or maybe it's that DC water| who knows ;) ).

POD is one of the best places to stay when visiting Downtown DC. Steps away from the Chinatown Metro Station| and Cap One arena. From here you can walk or Uber anywhere. We trekked all the way to Adams Morgan on our last visit...of course we hit every dive bar on the way.  The rooms are small (European style)| with basic amenities and the bed is comfortable. Who stays in their room while in DC? The Rooftop bar is great when the temp is right| and the bar in the basement can;t be beat at night. Love this place| and will definitely stay again.,Oct 17| 2018,5,Motto by Hilton Washington DC City Center,627 H Street NW| Washington| DC| 20001
GREAT location-- basically under the arch of Chinatown and across the street from the Chinatown Metro stop (direct yellow-line access to Reagan airport| but can also get on other lines there). Room was small (as was "desk") but functional and clean. Wifi worked. Staff were very friendly.

What a great concept! This hotel is so CLEAN! No icky carpets or old drapes and comforters- everything is modern and new| and no creepy| questionable fabrics in sight. The staff members are lovely| friendly| and helpful. And the location is amazing- I was able to walk to all my meetings and lots of tourist destinations. It's also right across the street from the metro| next to a huge| new drug-store| and surrounded by restaurants. Win-win-win!

This hotel is almost new as it opened juat a year ago| it is well located in downtown DC although the area around it s a bit rough. Great roof top bar and wiskey bar!

I love this place. It was so cute and the room had everything I needed. It just goes to show that sometimes big rooms can be overrated. Only thing we were missing was an iron and the amazing people at the front desk brought that up for us FAST. Usually I have to wait so long for something that I eithered called multipled times or forgot I asked for it. Nice and imitate. Which is my thing.

The diner food is good| not great| but we did eat at the Crimson diner two times because it was extremely convenient.  Did not get a chance to try the Whiskey Bar| but a local on the street said it was good.  It would be nice if the rooms had microwaves and an iron| other than that no complaints.
