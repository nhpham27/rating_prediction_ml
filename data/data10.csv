Will come back again if life ever allows me to. Thank you to the staffing! Only complaint was that I had to leave to go back home… lol,Aug 20| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
The location was convenient and close to many attractions within walking distance. However| there were cockroaches in the room. We reported the issue| and no resolution. Additionally| elevator service was prolonged. We were waiting almost 20 mins for an elevator| and walking downstair with luggage from the 38th floor was not an option.,Aug 16| 2021,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
The location was perfect,Aug 16| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
Great Hotel| near to Battery park| Walstreet| 9/11 Memorial(One world Trade center). Front desk staff at the hotel is very professional.,Aug 7| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
Rooms and halls are too small. Front desk person not friendly.,Aug 3| 2021,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
Took forever to check in| they seemed to have lost our reservation| the next day our room keys were disconnected and no longer worked to open our rooms| and it always took forever for the elevator to come (3 elevators for 40  floors is insufficient),Aug 3| 2021,2,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

Elevators were very slow| no valet parking| lobby on 2nd floor| room was very very small| construction all around hotel| the only good thing was the staff were nice,Jul 31| 2021,2,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
Liked location but they lied about the price of room.,Jul 31| 2021,1,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
Not new but decent place to stay at the location if the prices are on discount. The elevators are always busy but acceptable generally for tourists. Room is nice and clean. Staffs are kind of friendly. Amenities are excellent!,Jul 30| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
I didn't like the elevator situation.  Very crowded and hard to get on.  The fees for parking were outrageous.,Jul 29| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
Everything with the hotel was fine and is beautiful| just the parking lot is not good.,Jul 26| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
Using COVID as an excuse to not do housekeeping is fabricated. Finally got housekeeping on Day 4 after requesting for three days in a row. More likely the property is struggling with staff shortages but tell me that at check in then I j set stand the problem,Jul 21| 2021,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
If you want a hotel because location this is good because is close to vessel| little island| statue liberty and color museum. If the hotel is for relax…. Noooo is terrible| dirty| staff can’t constantly clean your room because| not enough towels just 2 and we are 5| you call to guest service and you request something and you need to call again and again,Jul 20| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

The staff was friendly and attentive to the needs.,Jul 19| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
Was decent| very close to the subway and battery park| elevator wait was long at times| but was moderately priced so you get what you pay for,Jul 19| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

Decent hotel| good prices for area.Poor elevator wait times for size of building.,Jul 8| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
This hotel was so small| it was obviously squeezed between two buildings. The rooms are absolutely tiny and the bathrooms are worse. The toilet paper was touching the toilet because there was no room!,Jul 6| 2021,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
Room cleaning is only on request. You must inform well in advance. No trash receptacles on floors. Only 3 small elevators for 44  floors. Be prepared for spending total of 30 minutes at elevators each day| if you go up an down more than a couple of times. Rent was okay| I was paying for the location.... the hotel by itself is not so much worth the rent.,Jul 6| 2021,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
The hotel was nice and close to things but they have issues with their elevators. We were on floor 26 and most of the time we took the stairs which was not convenient especially with luggage. The staff was nice.,Jul 6| 2021,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

Getting to hotel was a nightmare since the street was closed. I had to call hotel and the worker wasn’t knowledgeable at all about where I was located to help me. I was actually just around the block too| which makes me think she was just rude. When I arrived| she was not friendly| when I left there were additional| unfriendly to say the least workers. The shower edges need to be cleaned and recaulked. The beds didn’t really fit the double bedroom| very squishy. I’ve stayed in better hotels in New York| so I was very disappointed from the arrival to departure. And it was very expensive.,Jun 26| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
Hotel is tough to find. I lived in the Financial District| and I still found it difficult to locate. It was also pretty noisy. It seems like it would quiet because it's basically in an alley| but the restaurant/bar across the street means it's far from peaceful on a Saturday night. We also had to deal with drunk people coming off of the elevator around 2 am| and they were quite belligerent.,Jun 26| 2021,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

they always charge me a damage fee($350) even though I never damage hotel rooms. they hold the money for THREE TO FIVE days after the hotel stay| even though I have stayed there 5 times and have no record of destroying hotel property.,Jun 22| 2021,2,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
Because of COVID they didn’t clean the room which was fine but always having to ask for things and go from a high floor down to the lobby was a pain I wish they would make it easier to get supplies and not feel so bad. Also it’s the only Doubletree I’ve been to that doesn’t have cookies! Otherwise the hotel was great!,Jun 22| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

It advertised Breakfast but there was not even COFFEE.... For a High rise Hotel with 44  Floors having 2 of 3 Elevators down is Unsafe and Definitely a health Risk...I wanted to call the Health inspector or Fire Marshal to report but reconsidered because of the Hotel staff's Composure and poise in handling the influx of frustration ...

I stayed here for 12 days. As a long staying guest I was expecting great service| (which I guess as a guest I should expect regardless) however| it has been my worst stay at a hotel to date. First of all| the staff here at the reception is the poorest| most unhelpful| RUDEST staff I’ve ever seen in the hospitality industry. The staff was not helpful in anyway and would reply rudely and abruptly to any request or question. Since we were staying at the hotel for longer| we could get our room cleaned throughout the stay| we asked 5 times until someone cleaned the room and trust me when i say “clean”| it was just taking out the trash. There were also no soap| or toilet paper in the bathroom that I had to get down and get because there was no staff to bring anything to the room.Anyway| I can stand pretty much anything except for the rude staff here: they really left the most bitter taste in my mouth. I wish I hadn’t stayed here.,May 28| 2021,1,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
The staff was rude. The room wasn’t clean. Lights didn’t work in the room. The coffee maker had mildew and old water in it. Horrible for a Hilton property.,May 27| 2021,2,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

I wish I hadn’t stayed here.,May 28| 2021,1,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
The staff was rude. The room wasn’t clean. Lights didn’t work in the room. The coffee maker had mildew and old water in it. Horrible for a Hilton property.,May 27| 2021,2,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
The lack of elevators made traveling to/from the upper levels complicated. There was always a line.Also i tried to get room service and they never answered.,May 27| 2021,2,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

Crowded with party people. Loud at night. Scary fights late at night in the corridors.

Ask for a city view. Put us on the 40th floor. When we fo to check we cant catch an elevator down. So we had to walk with luggage down 40 flights of stairs.

Hotel room was pretty small but it did have a fridge which is always nice. They didn’t provide us with a trash can in the room or in the bathroom which was very odd and they didn’t do maid service due to COVID so we had various garbage around the room with no where to put it. The snacks in the small market were also insanely expensive. But the room itself was fine| small| but that is to be expected when staying in NYC. Overall is was far from the best place I’ve ever stayed but not the worst either.,Apr 26| 2021,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
Like most places in New York City the room was a little small but very comfortable for my wife and I. The staff was very nice and pleasant to deal with.

There was one morning where a dog that was left inside someone's room barked constantly until people complained and hotel employees had to come and check it out.

As frequent New York visitors| we have stayed in many hotels. This has by far been the worst. From the stains on our bedsheets to the paper thin walls and disruptive neighbors| we tried to be in the hotel as little as possible. The hotel itself feels old and outdated. The elevators take forever and are ancient. Every time we requested something from room service we were directed to a different extension and then redirected in circles until we gave up and found solutions ourselves. The other guests were incredibly disruptive and rude. Do not recommend and will not be returning. Does not enhance your New York experience| just causes stress.,Mar 15| 2021,1,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

As frequent New York visitors| we have stayed in many hotels. This has by far been the worst. From the stains on our bedsheets to the paper thin walls and disruptive neighbors| we tried to be in the hotel as little as possible. The hotel itself feels old and outdated. The elevators take forever and are ancient. Every time we requested something from room service we were directed to a different extension and then redirected in circles until we gave up and found solutions ourselves. The other guests were incredibly disruptive and rude. Do not recommend and will not be returning. Does not enhance your New York experience| just causes stress.,Mar 15| 2021,1,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

This is an extremely reasonably priced hotel for NYC. The staff is always very friendly and the room clean. Best is that it is so close to the subway.

I didn’t like how small the room was. Very cramp like. I could hear people in their room from my room. The halls felt like I was in the projects or a motel that was fitted as a shelter.  I had to go to several different floors for ice because there wasn’t any on the floor I was staying on.  There was no staff member at the desk where you go to buy water| so there was I guess a security guard trying to assist until someone showed up. The room was clean| though. The view from the room wasn’t so great.  Couldn’t connect to the WiFi.  I think it’s pricey for the stay there. I wouldn’t go back,Feb 15| 2021,2,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

We had several issues.Early check in wasn’t available when we arrived.They wouldn’t store our suitcase at 1st but the a sales manager got involved and placed it in his office while we spent the day in the city.When we returned around 3:45pm our room still wasn’t ready - at 4pm we were given keys to a room but when we arrived the keys didn’t work. I left my family in the hallway outside the room and went back down to have the keys remade. The 2nd set of keys didn’t work either. At this point my wife called down and about 12-15 minutes later someone came up to get us and move us to another room this one had a broken toilet. My wife took the kids down to the lobby to use the restroom while we waited for an engineer to fix the toilet. Once it was fixed we didn’t have any other issues with our stay.Grab and go breakfast was good.Beds were comfortable.Room was clean.,Oct 11| 2020,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

Terrible customer service relation and racist. Absence of social distance in the elevator. Elevator is about 3ftx3ft yet 5 people in inside at a time. No signage of social distance posted anywhere in the hotel. The worse| no parking space. You will pay extra $50 pee night for parking. No breakdast offerd with reservation. Very narrow hallway. The worst and most terrible hotel stay ever.,Sep 8| 2020,1,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
The first disappointment was when I booked the hotel there was an option to pay for the room alone| or book the option that includes a buffet breakfast. Traveling with 4 kids| I selected the rate that includes a buffet breakfast. I get to the hotel| and the women said there is no breakfast. Their only offering was a muffin| cup of fruit| and a juice. No sorry or anything. The second thing you notice is there is really no lobby. They are checking guest in through a booth| and you're pretty much waiting outside. There was alot of construction going on as well. Thirdly| the toilet stopped working in our room| and the front desk clerk moved us to another room. However| when we walked into the new room it was already occupied by other guest. Now me and our kids are downstairs in the outside lobby in our pajamas waiting for another room. The clerk at first couldn't find a room with two beds as they were supposedly all booked. So I'm like a hotel with 40 plus rooms. You don't have 1 room available with two beds to fit me and my kids. I was utterly disgusted with the hotel and staff. The staff acted so non-nonchalant as if they really don't care what you have to say| or what your concerns are. Long story| short| I would never stay at this hotel ever again! I visit NY alot| but this place would never be option any longer.,Sep 8| 2020,1,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

Room was great| staff was very nice and helpful. The hotel seems like it’s under construction. The whole front lobby was more of a construction site. A/C wasn’t working in the room and other guests aren’t respectful of social distancing.

Terrible customer service relation and racist. Absence of social distance in the elevator. Elevator is about 3ftx3ft yet 5 people in inside at a time. No signage of social distance posted anywhere in the hotel. The worse| no parking space. You will pay extra $50 pee night for parking. No breakdast offerd with reservation. Very narrow hallway. The worst and most terrible hotel stay ever.,Sep 8| 2020,1,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
The first disappointment was when I booked the hotel there was an option to pay for the room alone| or book the option that includes a buffet breakfast. Traveling with 4 kids| I selected the rate that includes a buffet breakfast. I get to the hotel| and the women said there is no breakfast. Their only offering was a muffin| cup of fruit| and a juice. No sorry or anything. The second thing you notice is there is really no lobby. They are checking guest in through a booth| and you're pretty much waiting outside. There was alot of construction going on as well. Thirdly| the toilet stopped working in our room| and the front desk clerk moved us to another room. However| when we walked into the new room it was already occupied by other guest. Now me and our kids are downstairs in the outside lobby in our pajamas waiting for another room.

Beside the construction thats still going on in the building. I had to change rooms because the first room was dirty| the glass door for the shower was broke off and there was glass shards on the floor and there was light bulbs left sitting on the side of the sink. The second room i was given was clean but didnt have any of the toiletries and the phone in the room didnt work i had to go all the way down stairs to tell them and i was on the 38th floor,Aug 30| 2020,2,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
The property is still under renovation and construction....plus no tv guide nor a bottle water in the room...very disappointed,Aug 29| 2020,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
The toilet did not flush| missing toiletries| building undergoing construction/renovation  which should have been mentioned during booking. An overall bad experience that has soured me on Doubletree and will no longer recieve my business.,Aug 29| 2020,2,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
Bed sheets were dirty| no sheet under comforter that is used for every guest| fridge was broken in one of the rooms we had. The other fridge only fit 3 bottles ( normal size).  Most times no towels or wash cloths. Front desk lady’s always have a attitude. The building should be shut down right now honestly| they’re redoing everything and it looks bad. I went on a Monday paid for city view and supposedly “they were booked up in my room type in the best city view floors” when I went there| there were a handful of guests. Every other door was still taped shut. ALSO PARKING is $40 small car & it’s$45 each time you go to park! You can’t just go get your car go get something to eat and park again! You’ll have to pay!! & street parking is beyond ridiculous to find| my family and I almost checked out right away because it was so difficult!  Would not recommend.,Aug 28| 2020,2,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
I loved the water front view| the room was very clean| and also the perfect size for two people. (One king size bedroom) Just a heads up there is construction going on in the main lobby/elevators so the “front desk” does seem a little sketch. Also something I wish I knew before going| 3rd party parking! $40.00 a night! Plan accordingly.,Aug 27| 2020,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
Even though it seems the hotel was under some type of renovation or construction in the check in area| the lady at the front desk was very helpful & informative. Also my room was very clean & comfortable I had a great view of the twin tower.,Aug 23| 2020,5,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
I reserved this room for my sister because she had been driving 36 hours. I paid with my card. Everything was confirmed. When she got there she was told that she needed a card with $50 to get the room. That was not stated in any terms when booking. She was not able to get the room so she had to sleep in her car. Very upset. Would like my refund since my sister was never able to stay there per an employee at that location.,Aug 22| 2020,1,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

This hotel is a very comfortable place to stay. The mattress| floor| bedding| walls| bathroom are very clean. I stood on the 38 floor in a king size bed and the view looking out into the water was beautiful! The N| W| R| 4| and 5 trains are up the block and right around the corner. The only thing I would change is they used a sheet for the based of the bed instead a fitted sheet. House keeping need to be better at putting a fitted sheet on the bed.

Beds comfy| location to food excellent| many choices to chill and have a drink. Subway very close. Room was cozy. Bathroom a little small-shower hot. Could have been cleaned better small mold in shower. Bed super comfy. Tv Great quality and lots of channels. Other reviews had slow elevator we did not encounter that problem. Staff was super friendly.,Feb 4| 2020,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
Everything was good but it was cold in the building. We adjusted the heat in the room and that worked fine but the halls and elevators were cold,Feb 13| 2020,5,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
The property was nice but small and felt a bit dated.  The staff was wonderful and helpful.  The only issue we had was that the elevators were very slow and with the height of that building| it was inconvenient.,Feb 12| 2020,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

Came home with bites on arms and legs - think there’s bugs here,Jan 4| 2020,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
There was a hole in the wall. Cracks in the bathroom sink. Dust everywhere. Random paint splotches on the furniture. No conditioner in the bathroom. The bed was not the size we paid for. Nice reception lady.,Jan 3| 2020,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
The property’s elevators were horrible due in part to the flow of traffic. There are only 3 elevators to accommodate 44 floors of people. If everyone is checking in and checking out at the same time you’re going to experience a significant bottleneck. Maybe think about managing the elevators better.,Jan 2| 2020,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
The property is in a good location. The staff are friendly courteous. And check in was a breeze. Over all a great experience so far. The rooms are very small but modern and updated. The only downside was due to the small size of the room there were no work desk to setup and work from my laptop,Jan 2| 2020,5,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
Horrible! Had a death in my family| made a hotel reservation and had to cancel. The hotel was booked| and even with my reason they would not give me my money back. But even better... they told me if i cancelled I would be charged for ANOTHER night. Great service!,Dec 31| 2019,1,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
Great staff always warm and embracing. The washroom conditions in my suite were atrocious. The toilet dripped all night long. After showering| I felt like I was standing in a mud puddle because the drainage was blocked. Same situation with the sink. I suppose the friendly service of their staff makes up for the poor facility.,Dec 30| 2019,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
Hotel is in the perfect location for subway access| statue| Brooklyn Bridge| Wall Street and World Trade. The room is perfect. Beds are comfortable. Only down side was the elevators.

This was a great hotel for our weekend visit to NYC. It was a bit away from what we wanted to do but the close train stations made traveling a lot easier. It was also in a quieter area which was nice. The room was very clean and every staff member that we interacted with was very kind and helpful. The bed that we got was incredibly comfortable and made it difficult to want to get up in the morning. Overall| we would stay here again! It was priced fairly compared to other hotels near it. The only things that were less than satisfactory were how slow and small the elevators were and there was no microwave or mini fridge. I know the rooms were small but they definitely could've fit them. With over 40 floors| the 3 elevators took forever when you called them. It was very awkward when it stopped on other floors to pick other people up but there wasn't enough room for them to get on. They could only fit about 5 people comfortably without any luggage or bags.,Dec 10| 2019,5,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
I booked this hotel for an employee for business travel. Upon a late arrival at 10pm at the hotel| he was informed that the hotel had actually overbooked rooms and did not have accommodations for him. Instead| he was sent to another hotel of poorer quality. We did not pay a cheap price tag for this room. I've tried getting in touch with both the hotel and hotels.com about the trouble but have yet to hear an answer-back. I did not even know that such service was even possible from a Hilton hotel. Be aware when booking here| at least through hotels.com. I'm always confident booking through the service for the "Guaranteed Room" promise...but this was far from the case.,Dec 9| 2019,1,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

Our stay was awful - the thermostat was broken and kept changing the heat| the bed was so small and old we kept rolling into the middle and we were put in a disabled room where the shower head sprayed everywhere and was broken. Would never stay here again.,Dec 5| 2019,1,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
Everything was great,Dec 2| 2019,5,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
Price paid should include breakfast.Not enough lifts for a hotel of this size.  Long waits for lift.,Dec 2| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
I was quite happy with the hotel itself but it was the first time I was staying at a noisy hotel. I could clearly hear what people saying in the next room and there was an ice machine close to my room which kept dropping ice every once in a while so when I came back after a long day| exhausted| I couldn’t really sleep well.,Dec 2| 2019,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
Very nice! In the past I’ve only stayed in Midtown| but I’d definitely choose this hotel again. It’s a 20 min train ride from Times Square but it was nice to get away from the chaos. Very accommodating- arranged adjoining rooms for me and a family member| gave great recommendations on nearby restaurants. I found others’ comments about slow elevators to be false. We never had a problem.,Nov 29| 2019,5,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

I love the hotel| the rooms the lobby the staff were amazing. My only Negative is the elevators were a bit slow at times and overworked for the size of the hotel. It was obvious that they weren’t all running at the same time. I would’ve preferred some fresh fruit to be available in your little lobby store and the gluten free cookies.

Hotel was relatively clean| aside from the room service tray with leftover food that was left sitting in the hallway for days. Rooms are EXTREMELY small| much smaller than other nyc hotels I’ve stayed in. Elevator situation is just unacceptable. We had to walk down the stairs and carry our luggage down with us. There was a bridal party staying in the 32nd floor that had to walk down and up the stairs. I won’t be staying here again.,Oct 14| 2019,2,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
Only stayed for one night so I didn't see much else of the property other than the lobby and my room. One thing to note and this goes to Doubletree as a whole.... please bake chocolate chip cookies with no nuts. There are entirely too many people with nut allergies now for Doubletree to bake cookies with nuts. The gluten free cookies are ok| but they're not the warm classic cookies Doubletree is known for.,Oct 13| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
It's much than what we thought. Room and bathroom are small but manageable. Clerk from the counter was very nice and helpful. Reception locates at 2nd floor.

Elevators are kind of busy but waiting time is not too bad. This is really location walking distance to many hot spots.,Oct 13| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

The room was very clean and comfortable. Bed was comfortable and bedding was very nice. The bathroom was very nice and clean as well. The only problem we encountered was the delay on the elevator. They had 3 elevators but only two of them were really working.  The staff also used the same elevators so it took longer to get to our room and down to the street.  We stay on foor 18 and unfortunately the person I traveled with has a walking disability so taking the stairs was not an option for us.  Other than that the hotel is a great location easy access to the metro and other shops.  Great walking distance to see the fireworks (our visit was during the 4th of July). The hotel is also environmentally friendly by saving energy.  Lights| ac ect only work when key hard is inserted. They also participate in water conservation efforts by giving guest the option to reuse their towels and not replacing the linen daily. Great experience and would definitely recommend to others.,Sep 23| 2019,5,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

It is well located for sightseeing. The lifts can take along time to come because the staff use them to go between floors instead of using the stairs. The hotel take a $350 deposit on check in and it does not get returned until 3-5 working days after check out. When you think there are 44 floors and 10 rooms per floor the hotel is making a great deal of money from this practice.,Sep 10| 2019,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

We came here for a two night stay during Labor Day weekend. Everything was great for our stay. The room (1 King Bed - City View) was not big| but it was bigger than what I expected considering the amount of rooms and size of the hotel. This was my first time staying in Lower Manhattan and I really enjoyed it. It's very quiet at night. My main concern about this hotel was the elevator situation after reading all of the negative reviews about it. Elevator problems ended up being a non-issue for us. There are only three elevators| which I can understand is a problem to some people. Our room was on the 37th floor (hotel has 44 total floors) and the longest we waited for an elevator during our entire stay was about 4 minutes. Other than that| we essentially were in an elevator less than a minute after pressing the button. They also move extremely fast from floor to floor| which was a surprise to me because I read reviews about them being slow. It was a holiday weekend so I figured it would take a while to get in the elevators| but again it was not a problem for us. Either we got lucky or we're very easy to please. The stay overall was great and the hotel was quiet. One thing to note: from our city view room on floor 37| we had a view directly at the World Trade Center| but it was a bit obstructed by other buildings. So don't expect the best view.,Sep 4| 2019,5,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

I understand the compact nature of the hotel and recognize that with a smaller footprint per unit the style of the accommodations would have to be different from what yo normally get in a Double Tree. However that doesn't excuse:1. Little room to put out amenities in the washroom.2. The shelf that is provided is small and not set perpendicular to the wall - as a result objects slide (fall off the shelf)3. An air - conditioner system that believes 71 degrees is a setting to reflect polar room temperatures and that setting it a 72 degrees is a signal to initiate heating the room4. A shower door that leaks like sieve - step out of the shower into a mini pool - this was reported to staff and essential no remedy provided.5. Finally - the water was turned off at mid-night on the first night - no warning - and when the desk was called - no explanation other that work was in progress. Given that the water was off - occupants should have been told to run the water the next morning to ensure any settling or dislodging of material in the system was removed.Negatives aside - the hotel is well situated from a tourist perspective.

The hotel was clean and the beds were comfortable. The access to WiFi was a plus and also to the computers downstairs since I needed to print a few things. One other plus was the food offered on the menu for breakfast was really good. The downside was definitely the hallways which were small and the elevators.

The wait for the elevator was at all hours of the day and night so that was a HUGE inconvenience.

It may seem unfair to compare this hotel to others in the doubletree brand but I am. I’ve stayed at several doubletrees and this was by far the worst. I picked my stay based on my experiences at the other brand hotels. The service was terrible. The in-room orders for breakfast (by hanging the order in your door) were cancelled but no one explained that to us until we called about the missing breakfast. Late night staff was rude and unhelpful to inquiries about available supplies in the pantry area. And the elevator service is by far the worst I’ve ever experienced. Waited nearly 20 minutes for an elevator that wasn’t packed or “out of service” because staff was using it. Best part of the stay was the location.,Jul 2| 2019,2,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
The only thing I did not like was the fact that each floor only had one double room and it is located directly across from the elevator.  Otherwise| it was a clean| comfortable property with a friendly| helpful staff.,Jul 1| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

Nice place| nice employees but the bathroom left a lot to be desired. Not enough room to change your mind! No room to store personal items while taking a shower! :),Jul 2| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
It may seem unfair to compare this hotel to others in the doubletree brand but I am. I’ve stayed at several doubletrees and this was by far the worst. I picked my stay based on my experiences at the other brand hotels. The service was terrible. The in-room orders for breakfast (by hanging the order in your door) were cancelled but no one explained that to us until we called about the missing breakfast. Late night staff was rude and unhelpful to inquiries about available supplies in the pantry area. And the elevator service is by far the worst I’ve ever experienced. Waited nearly 20 minutes for an elevator that wasn’t packed or “out of service” because staff was using it. Best part of the stay was the location.,Jul 2| 2019,2,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
The only thing I did not like was the fact that each floor only had one double room and it is located directly across from the elevator.  Otherwise| it was a clean| comfortable property with a friendly| helpful staff.,Jul 1| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

Very professional service| accomodating. Bed was comfortable| room was okay| could have been cleaner and roomier and it didn’t have a fridge or microwave.

Difficult to access on a day when there were road closures due to a local festival.  We had to park far away.  Only 2 elevators for 40 client floors led to long elevator waits.  Breakfast not included.  Room was very nice.  Bathroom tiny but functional.  It was fine but I probably would not stay again.  I know if a nearby hotel that is cheaper and includes breakfast.

Rude check in never again so upsetting and frustrating,Apr 14| 2019,1,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
As this is a New York Property| you need to expect the rooms will be small. They are however very clean and comfortable with great bedding and bathroom facilities. The hotel is in a great location with so much to do around the area and close to the subway.We unfortunately had some very negative concerns. Check in. We arrived early and understood that we wouldn't be able to check in until the correct time| but we thought we could at least ask. We were greeted by a very terse check-in attendant named Venetta who was extremely rude to us. Practically yelling to us "That check in is not until 2pm." We kindly asked if there was a  possibility to see if she could check.  Again we were yelled at again by her "Can't you see that Im very stressed out here! You need to wait and see when the manager arrives!" We asked if she could give us an indication as to when the manager might arrive. "I don't know!" She yelled| "Maybe in an hour - maybe in two hours?"  We sadly backed away and took our bags to the bell desk to be looked after while we went and found some breakfast. After this| we went back to see if this manager had turned up. He was there and we asked if we could check in early and he made everything look so easy. He found us all rooms that were available and checked us in early. We had other issues with the hot water - there's not enough space in this section so I will write about it in the next.,Apr 11| 2019,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

Lack of elevators| waiting time to get up 35 floors was excessive. Couldn’t get into our room. Had to wait for electrician to open our room and then wait while he had to go get new batteries for lock. Wait for new key cards. Bathroom hadn’t been cleaned. Dry urine on toilet seat.

Rude check in never again so upsetting and frustrating,Apr 14| 2019,1,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
As this is a New York Property| you need to expect the rooms will be small. They are however very clean and comfortable with great bedding and bathroom facilities. The hotel is in a great location with so much to do around the area and close to the subway.We unfortunately had some very negative concerns. Check in. We arrived early and understood that we wouldn't be able to check in until the correct time| but we thought we could at least ask. We were greeted by a very terse check-in attendant named Venetta who was extremely rude to us. Practically yelling to us "That check in is not until 2pm." We kindly asked if there was a  possibility to see if she could check.  Again we were yelled at again by her "Can't you see that Im very stressed out here! You need to wait and see when the manager arrives!" We asked if she could give us an indication as to when the manager might arrive. "I don't know!" She yelled| "Maybe in an hour - maybe in two hours?"  We sadly backed away and took our bags to the bell desk to be looked after while we went and found some breakfast. After this| we went back to see if this manager had turned up. He was there and we asked if we could check in early and he made everything look so easy. He found us all rooms that were available and checked us in early. We had other issues with the hot water - there's not enough space in this section so I will write about it in the next.,Apr 11| 2019,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

my first stay here and I was only here overnight.  I would only suggest that it is more clearly labeled that you have to go to the 2nd floor for the front desk.  It was nice a gentleman was there letting folks know but if he wasn't there I would have been lost.  In fact as I was leaving I noticed folks standing there wondering what to do.

Great location! Arrived in JFK in the early morning| and then took the subway to the hotel. Once I got off the subway| we were literally right by the Charging Bull| and about a 3 minute walk to the hotel. Once we got into the hotel| we were greeted immediately and offered to store our luggage. We were then told to proceed to the 2nd floor so that we could let the front desk know about our arrival| since it was too early to check in. Front desk was polite and quick. We were told that I would receive a text from the hotel when the room is ready| and we might not have to wait for the 3pm check in. I got a text from the hotel around 1pm| which was great because we were so tired!

I only stayed one night| but the room was well appointed and the bed was comfortable. My only complaint is that the elevators were small and extremely slow| so it they always over-crowded.,Dec 20| 2018,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

The elevators were the worst part about the property. Also| I find it very frustrating that they sell to you in the lobby.,Dec 18| 2018,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
The hotel itself was very clean and a great location. Rooms were small but that was to be expected in NYC. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Downside: the room was so hot no matter what temperature we set the thermostat at and there was no exhaust system in the bathroom.

The hotel was everything you would expect from a Double Tree. The staff is what made our experience great. We did not realize that the lobby was on the second floor. We were helped multiple times by different employees. The fitness room was great and had everything we needed. The only thing this hotel lacks is more elevators. Ask to be placed in a lower level because elevators take a while to come down from the higher levels. Again| every staff member we met from the staff behind the lobby desk| the maintenance people| and the luggage person on the first floor were all lovely.,Nov 26| 2018,5,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

Dreadful hotel.  Rooms are small and bathroom is extremely small. NO storage in the bathroom and NO counter space.  The WiFi was terrible.  I was on the phone at least 4 times for a minimum of 25 minutes each time getting the connection reset.  I will NEVER stay at this hotel again!,Oct 1| 2018,1,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
Will never stay here again.  Entrance is hidden; walked past it 3 times!  Very unattractive entrance on ground floor.  3 elevators for a 40 story building.  Wait| wait| wait.  Small room with 2 double beds.  Bathroom clean but tiny.  No place to hang anything - no hooks except one on back of door.  No shelves in bathroom to place anything.  We were given two plastic cups in the main room.  That was it.  Toilet paper roll was so close to the toilet that it required some gymnastics to take tissue from the roll.  The shampoo container was the smallest I've ever seen in a hotel.  And| only one of them provided...for 3 people.  I am surprised that Hilton would put its name on this place.

Horrible! First of all| 40+ story hotel| 1/3 elevator was out of service (which was also the case when i stayed there 2 years ago)| though this time i was there for 3 nights and didn’t see 1 technician at all throughout my stay. Also| considering the fact most guests were using stairs when staying on a reasonable floor| they thought it was a good idea to paint the ramps at that same time. Then| plumbing was a real issue| as whenever someone on my floor (24th| which wasn’t a problem for my other family members staying on 6th and 7th) there was a terrible loud squealing sound. I slept with earplugs| but when i took my shower in morning| neighbour (who i assumed just checked in) came banging on my door complaing for noise as if it was my fault.To finish| on our last night| fire alarm went off at 2:25am| evacuating only people on 12-14th floor. Again| my family were staying on 6-7th so got woken up for nothing and just decided to leave because they were fed up.To top this off| i was the only guest in my room. I left my room and when i came back a while later| i couldn’t get into my room. The old school lock had mysteriously locked the door so I had to call front desk. The “ingeneer” said: “oh sh*t| thats going to take a while” and hung up.Keep it up Dounletree... (Place was sold recently| was way better before),Sep 19| 2018,1,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
Staff are awesome. It's the design that is bad. This property is in need of a renovation. The elevators just do not work. We had to walk up 17 stories on more than one occasion.

Where to start? The elevator thats constantly out of service which means it takes ypu 20 minutes to get downstairs from your room. The false alarm fire alarm at 230am| then 20 minutes before receiving instructions to come downstairs for no good reason. Maybe if this was a real emergency we would have been in real trouble with the knowledge to handle such a situation properly.  Then of course having to wait a half hour for the elevator to get back up to my room with my 2-year old daughter which i had to wake up for no reason. Good luck getting her back to sleep at 3am.Explain to me how a hotel chain such as Hilton not have a crib on sit? Seriously showed up to the room in a pack n play for new borns.All in all one of the worst experiences ive ever had at a hotel.  Thank goodness it was only for 2 nights. Cant express how disapppinted i am in my experience. Knowing all of this| no one offered any kind of compensation for all the inconveniences.

Good luck getting her back to sleep at 3am.Explain to me how a hotel chain such as Hilton not have a crib on sit? Seriously showed up to the room in a pack n play for new borns.All in all one of the worst experiences ive ever had at a hotel.  Thank goodness it was only for 2 nights. Cant express how disapppinted i am in my experience. Knowing all of this| no one offered any kind of compensation for all the inconveniences. Cant recommend this hotel to anyone and i dont think i would ever stay at a hilton again.,Sep 17| 2018,1,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

the elevators were being repaired and I waited over 40 minutes in the hallway| which was not air conditioned repeatedly for 4 days.  It was a horrible experience.,Sep 8| 2018,1,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
They should’ve said in the description that there were repairs going on. The elevators took so long. Also| the rooms and hallways are small| cramped| you can clearly see they’re maximizing every inch of space. Two double-bed room should come with a mini-fridge| mine did not.,Sep 7| 2018,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
Unprofessional staff at checking.Unacceptable elevator wait. 1/3 elevator down.Very noisy room. Noisy a/c and noisy water pipes.,Sep 7| 2018,2,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
On the first night of my stay| there was a building-wide water outage. Maintenance worked quickly and was able to get the water turned back on. The rest of my stay| one of the elevators was broken meaning there were only two available for 44 floors of guests. Luckily I was on the eighth floor| so i frequently just used the stairs| but this was a huge inconvenience after a long day when all you want to do is get back to your room quickly.,Sep 6| 2018,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
Wifi was non functional (one bar); the phones in the rooms did not work; the television barely worked (picture was fuzzy); it took my parents hours to check in because a pipe burst on their floor; one of the elevators was broken so only one elevator was servicing 45 floors; overall very disappointing. I’ve stayed in better 1 star hotels in developing countries. Would not stay here again.,Sep 5| 2018,2,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
Only issue we had was due to an out of service elevator. It caused quite a few delays but the staff was kind and informative regarding the matter.,Sep 5| 2018,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

Excelente estancia| cerca de todo!,May 19| 2019,5,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
かなり早いチェックインになったが快く受け入れてくれた。部屋もかなり広い。周辺エリアは観光エリアなので飲食店も多く、安全だと思う。ただ狭い路地みたいな所もあるのでそこには行かない方がいい。ただ一点気になった点があるチェックインの時ドアノブの下のネジが外れていて勢いよく閉めると閉まるがゆっくり閉めようとすると閉まらないと指摘したが閉まるから問題ないと言われた。それ以外は問題ない。,May 6| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

Gute Lage mit Zugang zu allen Subway Verbindungen.Negativ ist die unmittelbar gegenüberliegende Bar mit sehr lauter  Musik bis tief in die Nacht. Zimmer wurden bei sechstägigem Aufenthalt zweimal nicht bzw. nur auf wiederholte Reklamation gereinigt.,Apr 23| 2019,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

교통편이 아주 편리하고 아침식사는 매우 소박하고 맛이 좋음. 샤워시설이 다소 불편함이 있음,Jan 9| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
Reception-väen ja ovimiesten palvelu oli loistavaa. Hotelli oli yleisesti hyvässä ja siistissä kunnossa. Siivouksessa hieman parannettavaa| mm. huolellisuudessa (meillä oli likaiset lakanat). Siivooja tuli myös hätistelemään meitä check-out päivänä ennen varsinaista check-out aikaa. Hyvät kulkuyhteydet joka suuntaan| kolme eri metrolinjaa kävelyetäisyydellä. Alueella myös paljon ruokapaikkoja ja kahviloita. Lähellä puisto| josta näkee vapaudenpatsaalle.,Jan 8| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004

Clean and good quality hotel| spacious rooms in NY scale. Sightseeing locations require a subway which is close by. The hotel has a good wifi and the gym is decent for a hotel gym (barbells but no bench press or bar). The rooms were much nicer than I have seen in any midtown hotel which cost more. I would definitely come again to this hotel.,Dec 5| 2018,5,DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,8 Stone St| New York| NY| 10004
