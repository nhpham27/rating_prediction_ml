Just horrible.  The smoke alarm had been removed| the mattress was horrible (we both woke up with sore backs)| the safe did not work| both the restaurant and bar were closed| no coffee maker| and overall the space was dingy dirty.  This hotel needs a complete overhaul.  After one night we checked out early and moved to the AC Hotel nearly that was sooooo much better!,Aug 19| 2021,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
My only complaint was that the internet connection came and went fairly often. When I arrived I spent over an hour trying the get it to work over the phone with tech support. They were understanding. It still came and went though over time over my stay. Frustrating,Aug 19| 2021,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Very nice place to stay in the heart of Times Square.Hotel was nice| and the city views were fantastic| but carpeting in room was soiled and in need of replacement and the hallways need to be updated. That said| I would still come back here because it was a good value.,Aug 19| 2021,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
no fridge,Aug 19| 2021,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Being surprised with the 23rd floor and such an amazing view on my first solo trip was heaven! The staff was kind| they gave me resources to find my phone when I lost it in the city| and were very friendly! The entire place was gorgeous and even more so in person!,Aug 19| 2021,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Good value,Aug 18| 2021,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
It’s a dirty place. Furniture is broken inside of the room. Windows are dirty. Area around the hotel is in terrible condition now| it was even gun shooting at night.. not safe| dirty... staff trying their best I guess...,Aug 18| 2021,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
The facility needs a renovation. Everything is scratched and dented. Bedspread was ripped. Great location| but needs some TLC,Aug 18| 2021,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Location was awesome|  front desk people were nice. No ammenities offered. We tried to switch our room higher for a better view we got a worse view and the room was way hotter. Even the 18th floor the air condition did not work well at all. The room she put us in was not a good view at all either so we may as well have just stayed lower where the room was a little cooler. P.s. the elevators high up are terrible.,Aug 18| 2021,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Nice staff| very helpful. The Lobby is beautiful| however the hotel is a little outdated. Maybe a little face lift would make it an extraordinary place.,Aug 17| 2021,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
It was okah,Aug 17| 2021,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
The hotel room was very outdated and things in the room didn’t work properly. The drain in the shower didn’t drain and the drawers for the dresser were messed up. Room wasn’t very clean,Aug 17| 2021,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
The hotel was nice but next time I visit It’ll be at a different one.,Aug 17| 2021,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Wish they had a mini fridge and ice| other than that it was perfect.,Aug 16| 2021,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
I was very disappointed that the room was not up to date like the photos online when I booked. Also there was stains on the furniture and carpet. The bathroom and handles needed to be cleaned better before arrival. Overall I expected a better view of the hotel room,Aug 16| 2021,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Very close to Times Square. Our room was clean| no issues. The hotel overall is outdated and even if it's a non smoking facility there is a strong smell🚭,Aug 16| 2021,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Very poor customer service from the front desk stuff. They didn’t even greet us. Shower wouldn’t drain well| first day they didn’t clean the room until the evening when I called for clean  towels. horrible view| the worst there was no coffee pot with tea bags  in the room as most of the hotels have| I get chronic migraines and I must drink caffeine at the same time every day. No microwave either. Horrible!! I was very disappointed!!!  When we were checking out I was in front of the line waiting to be called  until I realized I had to walk towards him or he wouldn’t call me| then he barely talk to me| didn’t tell me how I owed or anything  I felt uncomfortable and not welcome. Awkward!!,Aug 12| 2021,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
It was great to be there| very good location near to many service| area very safe| we feel very comfortable in this property,Aug 11| 2021,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Great location.  The beds were "okay".  Double beds| but this is the case in most hotels.  I wish they were Queen beds.,Aug 11| 2021,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Gross. Lobby is super Nice… then We head to our floor which looked like we were in a totally different hotel. Our room smelled like cigarettes| the wall paper was peeling off in some spots the outlets had no covers on them a layer of dust all over everything curtains and comforter had stains on them and the shower/tub was disgusting. Literally wore shoes In the shower…,Aug 11| 2021,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Did not like the $50 early check in fee even tho she stated our room was ready.  That totally sucks. The room was dirty with black hair everywhere| counters| toilet| shower| walls| base of toilet was disgusting| bathroom ceiling looked like snot all over it. Really disappointed. Stained hallway carpet broken ice machine,Aug 11| 2021,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Let me first say that this review is the truth.  Rooms are not good| very dated and carpets dirty with stains.  Pictures have been removed from walls and not replaced so you can see the former outline.  Our room had a condom (in the wrapper) left on the floor.  There was hair left in the bathroom.  We told the front desk and they moved us to a different room.  Same dated room without the condom or the hair.   We were on the fair elevator (farthest from the entrance to the elevators) and as we were going up it felt like the brake slipped and it went down 2-4 floors.  We actually thought we were going down.  The elevator did grab and kept going up.  The woman that was in the elevator with us will probably review this too.  We told the front desk and they said they would look into this.  Not a good experience,Aug 11| 2021,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Great location ! However| the AC wouldn’t work. We asked several times and they said an “engineer” fixed it. It stayed muggy at 82 degrees. I eventually asked for a fan in the evening time because it wouldn’t cool down past 77. (And it is July and humid) The outside door men were extremely friendly and helpful. The only reason I wouldn’t use this hotel again is the of time wasted on my short stay trying to get cooler air. I feel the front desk should have cared more.,Aug 1| 2021,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Excellent service. The property could use a refresh of paint and general touch ups. However| Property is clean and in an excellent location. I would stay again.,Aug 1| 2021,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
The hotel is always clean and it has a good small.all.the time. Theur stuff is always there to help| room was clean and comfortable. The hotel is right next to times squares.,Aug 1| 2021,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Great location ! However| the AC wouldn’t work. We asked several times and they said an “engineer” fixed it. It stayed muggy at 82 degrees. I eventually asked for a fan in the evening time because it wouldn’t cool down past 77. (And it is July and humid) The outside door men were extremely friendly and helpful. The only reason I wouldn’t use this hotel again is the of time wasted on my short stay trying to get cooler air. I feel the front desk should have cared more.,Aug 1| 2021,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
I love the location| staff and service,Aug 1| 2021,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
The location was ideal| smack in the middle of Time Square,Jul 31| 2021,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
The Hotel did not depict what the picture advertised.  My city view was the back of buildings. The air was poor not properly blowing cool. Our room smelled like smoke. I was very disappointed.,Jul 26| 2021,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Perfect and pleasure,Jul 26| 2021,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
The property needs updating| rooms were dirty| toilet leaking and paint peeling| stain on carpet| glitter on bed spread| went to talk to the Manager and it still took 3 calls afterwards to get clean blankets. Not a good experience,Jul 26| 2021,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Honestly this was probably the most disgusting hotel I’ve ever stayed. We learned that during the pandemic this hotel that was previously associated with the Double tree Hilton (and notified of the disassociation a month before the trip) that our hotel housed a large population of the homeless. While I feel for people in these dire situations| The rooms conditions and cleanliness was absolutely unacceptable and disgusting. I do not recommend this property and I would not stay ever again.,Jul 26| 2021,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
The hotel has a great location|  it's walking distance from many attractions.  When we initially booked the hotel it was a Doubletree/Hilton so we thought it would have the same or similar accommodations as Doubletree even with the name change| but unfortunately they were the same.,Jul 25| 2021,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
room,Jul 25| 2021,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Our rooms were gross and stunk like cigarettes| there was mold in the shower and around the toilet. Our sheets were ripped| carpet was stained and walls were dirty. We only stayed because we were unable to get our money back and couldn’t find anywhere else day of. The only saving Grace was Sasha at the front desk| the housekeeping staff and the most wonderful bellhop who I am sure was the boss… he had just come back from the pandemic| I wish I knew his name because he was wonderful. I do understand things are rough especially on the hospitality industry due to the pandemic which is why I didn’t go full “Karen” but c’mon your hotel is dirty| time to step it up a little,Jul 25| 2021,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
The towels smelt terrible and didn't seem clean. There was no toilet paper in the whole hotel so I had to go buy my own| not something I was expecting to do while on vacation. The shower didn’t drain and I asked room service to take care of it. They didn’t! There was trash in the drawers when we first got there so the room was not properly cleaned.,Jul 25| 2021,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Property was great and very convenient to Times Square| other sights| hop on buses and other transportation.

The location was fantastic. The staff was friendly. The hotel needs some major updating. We tried three different rooms before we were happy with our room. The first one smelled like smoke and was dirty| with the bathroom ceiling caving in from water damage. The second room had mold all over the bathroom and awful stains on the carpet. It had not been cleaned very well either. The third room had an amazing view| but had someone's old food in the fridge and the lights didn't work half the time. It looked like the carpet behind the bed hadn't been cleaned in years. This property needs some major updating. We actually almost cancelled and moved to a different hotel the minute we walked in. The phones don't connect to any hotel services either. They just ring to nowhere. They gym was nice. No guest laundry facilities. Honestly| look elsewhere. You will be disappointed.

The room they had us check into had not been cleaned by housekeeping. Dirty towels were still on the floor and beds.

I enjoyed my stay here. Check-in was relatively easy. The staff was very nice and accommodating. And the hotel is in a great location. We were able to walk to most of the places we wanted to visit.,Jul 12| 2021,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
The room they had us check into had not been cleaned by housekeeping. Dirty towels were still on the floor and beds. They immediately gave us another room which we found dirty wrappers on the edges under the bed (was afraid to look further) and a zip lock bag of what possibly could have been old peanut butter in the corner of the room by the bed.,Jul 12| 2021,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Great location| below average property. They do r hold luggage. Never even occurred to me to ask because I have never encountered a hotel that didn’t offer this service. No shampoo in bathroom. Shower got to lukewarm at best.,Jul 10| 2021,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
This hotel was FAR below standards.  The original room we received upon arrival was gross| nasty| dirty| stains on the walls| dusty...we were scared and it felt unsafe. We complained and was moved to another room that was cleaner but also had issues. The phone didn't work|  toilet wouldn't flush properly|  television kept going off| the room was sooooo small|  the "Ball View" was a joke and to add insult ro injury they charged us for daily hotel fees after telling us there would be no charges.  The hotel has the look and feel of the hotel from American Horror Story..accept AHS hotel at least had an open restaurant bar. I would not ever recommend this place to anyone.,Jul 10| 2021,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Positives:  Management was polite and accomodating when we asked for early check in and a late check out.  There is strong police presence in the area.The location is wonderful for subway transportation| shopping| fast food| coffee| and a Walgreens is located next door to the hotel.Negatives:  Room service is available| uoon request. We requested room service (or at least clean towels) everyday for our stay. We stayed a total of seven evenings and only received room service for four of the eight evenings.  We had to call each of those four nights for clean towels. The beds were extremely hard and the thermostat did not properly work. Our room stayed at 65 degrees and we were unable to change the temperature.  Engineering was supposed to fix the thermostat| however| it only properly worked for one day.The carpets in the room were very dirty and the pictures displayed of the rooms make the rooms look much nicer than they are in person. Hot water for showering were not consistently available in the evenings.

Right in the heart of Times Square. This hotel was exactly what I needed. Exit toward 44th Street and you’re right in front of Good Morning America. Exit toward 45th and ta-dah you’ve got shops like Disney Store and Old Navy just steps from your door. Literally takes a single minute to be in the middle of Times Square from the hotel. We had a room on the 27th floor. We could see most of the ball drop apparatus from our room. My sister’s room a few doors down was the corner room with a perfect view of the ball drop AND the Empire State Building. Close to the subway entrances (42nd St and 45th depending where you were headed). Check in was quick and easy. Housekeeping brought up extra towels pretty quick. Room was clean. Beds were comfortable. Only thing missing was a refrigerator but it’s not a deal breaker. I will definitely be looking to stay here again on my next trip!,Jul 5| 2021,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The expectations had for this hotel were high due to its great location in time square| however the experience my family had was not please (it was their first time in NYC-TimeSquare).First| I had to call the hotel to add a day to our reservation since we were arriving a day early. The reservation agent from the hotel commented “they usually give those who book through a third party website whatever room is available| not what they select on the website” when I asked to add a day to my reservation in the room previously booked or to upgrade my room as I was willing to pay extra. In the end I had to do a second reservation.   When I arrived to the room after checking in. The the room was NOTHING like the photos| nor was it the room I had booked. The room at first glance had a dirty carpet| the walls were dirty| the furniture was not well kept| the closet was broken and the bathroom was poorly kept. I then walked out of the room and requested a new room. The second was in the same conditions| at this point. I was frustrated because this would be the first impression my family will have of the city. After speaking to my family they decided to stay and not check into another hotel since they were tired from traveling 15 hours. When requesting a change of room the front desk agents were not pleasant they questioned WHY and I told him it was due to cleanliness and state of the room| he proceeded to an attitude and an unwelcoming demeanor.Continued….,Jul 4| 2021,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The property looked nothing like the pictures in the booking on Expedia. Charged $50 for early checks which should be a curtesy. The room was fair at best. Old and dated and clean enough.

Overall its an ok place at best. Our room was clean| but the cabinet door was off the hinge| there wasno vent switch inbatheoom and the paint was bubbled from condensation. There was no mini fridge even after i requested one be brought to the room.

Staff and their manager were both bad. Room was full of dust and I fell sick. I had cold| cough and fever during our stay there.We were supposed to get a room with city view and were charged extra for that. We got a roomthat had no view| except the buildings on the other side of the road.We were also promised complimentary breakfast as we paid for a top floor room| but no breakfast was served.We were promised that our luggage will be kept safely on the last day of our travel while still go around until evening| but they did not rather wanted me to pay extra if we have to leave our luggage with them.

The property looked nothing like the pictures in the booking on Expedia. Charged $50 for early checks which should be a curtesy. The room was fair at best. Old and dated and clean enough. We did have a decent view but not worth staying there.I wouldn’t stay there  again or recommend.,Jul 1| 2021,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Overall its an ok place at best. Our room was clean| but the cabinet door was off the hinge| there wasno vent switch inbatheoom and the paint was bubbled from condensation. There was no mini fridge even after i requested one be brought to the room. I would probably try another hotel for our next stay before returning here,Jun 30| 2021,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Staff and their manager were both bad. Room was full of dust and I fell sick. I had cold| cough and fever during our stay there.We were supposed to get a room with city view and were charged extra for that. We got a roomthat had no view| except the buildings on the other side of the road.We were also promised complimentary breakfast as we paid for a top floor room| but no breakfast was served.We were promised that our luggage will be kept safely on the last day of our travel while still go around until evening| but they did not rather wanted me to pay extra if we have to leave our luggage with them. The whole experience of staying here was so bad and will never recommend this place to anyone.,Jun 30| 2021,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The staff were all amazing. The room was mediocre. The bed is like sleeping on cement the pillows are extremely flat. The room and hotel are outdated. There was water damage apparent on the bathroom walls. The toilet was ripping away from the wall and there was mold all over in the shower. One night we called twice for extra towels and we’re told they were coming they never showed when we called the next morning we had new towels within minutes. They only cleaned our room twice during an 8 night stay. We had to pay the $200 resort fee but all amenities besides the gym were closed.

The view was amazing but the cleanliness and staff assistance was horrible. The bathroom had someone’s hair all over the walls. The TV in the room didn’t work in which we called multiple times about and kept getting disconnected. My husband went downstairs to talk to someone and came back to the room with someone from maintenance| just for him to take a look and say that he’ll be back and never came back.,Jun 25| 2021,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Checked in to a city view long bed. The computers were down so check in process took a while but they gave us a late checkout 2 pm for following day. We then went to our room. Carpet was stained. View was horrible and there was an odor. Asked for another room and we got one. Other room was fine| clean but small. Staff very nice.as they try. Location is selling point. right in time square,Jun 25| 2021,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
We liked that it was really close to Times Square| basically at Times Square. What we didn’t like was that when we first arrived to the room our sheets were very dirty. Called numerous times and no one came up and eventually had to talk to a manager. When housekeeping came and the sheets were still dirty.,Jun 25| 2021,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Hotel is ideally located in midtown close to transit. The rooms are small and dated| but they accomplish what most tourists need. Room cards are problematic when it comes to elevator use.Like many hotels nowadays| you need to tolerate some boisterous fellow guests late at night and marijuana smoking.Amazing views of NYC's dense urban fabric.,Jun 23| 2021,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Hotel was nice. Clean. Not the most fabulous looking hotel. Great location though!!! Step out right to the Times Square. If you want views| make sure to choose the room that offers views!!! Most of the rooms do not provide the great view people look for. Front desk is very helpful. Especially Kayla!!!! She helped me to swith the hotels from next door Millennium Premier to Broadway. And helped me to reserve a room that had a view to a Time Square. Overall|  enjoyed the stay.

One staff member was good enough to find us a fan later in the day. Was hard to reach management and when we did they were not helpful or seemingly apologetic. Even several staff members said management was bad. I  would like to be compensated for a horrible experience.

Property is in a great location. Has a great staff... Rooms are showing wear and tear and in need of a total remodel. First 2 days had house keeping services. Last 2 days not so much.

The property did not look like the hotel we booked and we booked a hilton and it changed ownership prior to our trip. The room smelled very badly of cigarettes and was clean but very outdated. Bathroom had no fan| no lock on door and the sink had a moldy trim. No fridge or microwave in room. Location was great though.,Jun 19| 2021,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
You get what you pay for - I was there for work and knew I’d be working 12hr days so it was a place to sleep and shower but I had to request a refrigerator be delivered to my room as it was gone and had to call room service twice to get more toilet paper - good for the budget but be ready for a few inconveniences,Jun 19| 2021,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The property did not look like the hotel we booked and we booked a hilton and it changed ownership prior to our trip. The room smelled very badly of cigarettes and was clean but very outdated. Bathroom had no fan| no lock on door and the sink had a moldy trim. No fridge or microwave in room. Location was great though.,Jun 19| 2021,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
You get what you pay for - I was there for work and knew I’d be working 12hr days so it was a place to sleep and shower but I had to request a refrigerator be delivered to my room as it was gone and had to call room service twice to get more toilet paper - good for the budget but be ready for a few inconveniences,Jun 19| 2021,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Carpet was nasty and the bathroom had mold. Also the whole hotel smelt like marijuana.,Jun 19| 2021,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
It was a ok stay. When i first got there i had to change rooms cause i didn't like the room i was given because it was not clean an it smelled but after i got in my second room it was ok. I like it cause its at the center of everything including times square.,Jun 19| 2021,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

After traveling all day| I finally arrived at this hotel around 11:40pm to find out they gave away my PAID hotel rooms to someone else. What made it worse is that Daniel just went to the back without any explanation for about 30 minutes leaving us stranded in the lobby with no one helping us. The other employees that were there refused to help as well. Nicolas finally came out and explained to me that there were no rooms available and offered another hotel room 9 blocks away. Me and my kids had no other choice so we had to walk through NY city at 12:30am just so we wouldn't have to sleep on the street. The entire time this hotel staff was not even sorry about their mistakes and actually rude. Nicolas offered 1 night refund for 1 room when I asked but hotels.com doesn't even see that. This hotel cannot get anything right and they are a disgrace to the Hilton brand.,Jun 17| 2021,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Check in and check out are crowded with long lines. Didn't like the one front desk clerk who refuse to slpit my payment on two cards but the other front desk had no issue. Don't belive it was policy because more than one front desk clerk said rhey didn't understand why he wouldn't do it.

I had a person who was hanging out in the street and in and out of the lobby follow me to my hotel room. He went right by a staff member onto the elevator (you are supposed to show your key to get that far) with me and proceeded to follow me to my room. After I was inside| he knocked on my door wanting in my room. My hotel room phone did not work to the front desk so I had to call the hotel’s main line on my cell phone and ask for security. In the hotel’s defense security did act quickly and he was removed. This may be an isolated incident but it was enough for me not to want to stay there again. In general we liked our room and staff was friendly| but again this incident was just too much to overcome.

We checked out around 10 then around 30 mins we realized that my boyfriend left his earring and hat in the room we retired around 10:45/11 am the staff escorted my boyfriend to the room since the reservation was under my name and I wasn’t able to return to the hotel with him. Upon arriving to the room the cleaner and was still cleaning making the bed up as they arrive the hat was gone and the earrings were gone. Immediately my boyfriend and the security starting checking. We specifically left the hat on the couch and earrings on the night stand. All of a sudden they are missing and the only other person to have entered the room since us leaving was the cleaner so naturally the security asked the cleaner did she see the items and she said no. Which doesn’t make sense cause we know for a fact where we left them and they were no where on our person my boyfriend would’ve automatically put the earrings in his ears and hat on his head if he rembrfore we left since we were in a  hurry. The staff were not helpful in the investigation besides the security guard Al the cleaner definitely stole the earrings since the hat was returned to us after the security guard returned to talk to me downstairs once I was able to return to the hotel. We have yet to hear anything these warring aren’t cheap and no one seems to care. The cleaner wasn’t held accountable and we were led to believe that there would be further investigation but since no one has contacted us or returned the items.,Jun 11| 2021,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The rooms have not been updated since probably 1970 with very very worn out beds| pillows| and everything else.  The rooms dont even have a microwave or a fridge.  The drain stop in the tub was broken.  The room was worse than what I would expect at a 1 start place.

They advertised a sofa bed. The staff said they got rid of their sofa beds and gave us 2 rollaway beds. The Rollaway beds were awful. Extremely uncomfortable and felt like you were sleeping on metal springs.  We requested the Rollaway beds at check-in at 4pm. Called Front Desk at 8pm to remind about Beds. Didn't receive beds till after 9:00pm|  Initial Reservations were made for 4 people.,Jun 7| 2021,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

It is highly misleading online. DO NOT get the skyline view. Your view will be a wall or maybe a building or two| not the skyline. The original room smelled like cigarettes and the view was one building. When we asked to be transferred| front desk transferred us to a queen size room where there was no mini fridge for the things that we bought. The view was misleading once again and we originally paid for a king| not a queen. When we went back down| the staff was very rude and told us that they had no other option for us because they needed to leave the “good” rooms for the people that were checking in later that day.

It was problem after problem at this hotel. Don’t stay here.,Jun 7| 2021,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
My friend and I both stayed in this hotel. Both of our rooms had mold and had to be switched to different rooms. Carpet was super dirty. There is no fridge and blow dryer did not work. The only positive thing about this hotel is the location. Other than that| I will never stay here again.,Jun 7| 2021,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

They advertised a sofa bed. The staff said they got rid of their sofa beds and gave us 2 rollaway beds. The Rollaway beds were awful. Extremely uncomfortable and felt like you were sleeping on metal springs.  We requested the Rollaway beds at check-in at 4pm. Called Front Desk at 8pm to remind about Beds. Didn't receive beds till after 9:00pm|  Initial Reservations were made for 4 people.,Jun 7| 2021,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

My first night there my tub got clogged up after that the toilet- I literally had to keep going to the desk to get new key cards because mine kept deactivating and they were not around anything- last day there I had a question about my key card not working again and was in a rush so to my lift arriving to take me to the train station the women with blonde hair was so rude to myself and another guest! I will be calling the hotel this week very Unacceptable,Jun 7| 2021,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
It is highly misleading online. DO NOT get the skyline view. Your view will be a wall or maybe a building or two| not the skyline. The original room smelled like cigarettes and the view was one building. When we asked to be transferred| front desk transferred us to a queen size room where there was no mini fridge for the things that we bought. The view was misleading once again and we originally paid for a king| not a queen. When we went back down| the staff was very rude and told us that they had no other option for us because they needed to leave the “good” rooms for the people that were checking in later that day. After putting our foot down| they transferred us the following day to a better room with a view of Times Square| however| that day and the rest of the weekend| the air was broken in our room| and many others.

My time at the Millennium was not at all enjoyable. The pictures on Expedia's site are quite manipulative. The pictures I saw portrayed this hotel as luxurious| interactive| and most importantly clean. The Millennium Hotel was far from clean. There was a smoker's stench in my room--primarily in the carpet. The carpet had visible stains along with the linens there were on my bed. There was a lack in receiving "cleaning" service from Housekeeping in this particular hotel. There was a struggle for the hotel staff to answer the phone just so that I can obtain clean linens. My friend who stayed with me has quite a few medical issues. One of his major health alignments is diabetes. My friend uses Insulin to treat his diabetes. There was NO REFRIGERATOR in our room for him to house| to keep his Insulin shots cool. That not only is irresponsible but should be viewed as a liable action. I urge anyone who reads this review to not book with this hotel because I thought I was going to a luxurious stay and it was not.,Jun 2| 2021,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Hair scrunchie under the chair. I vuess they forgot to vacuum the rug. Tub backed up when I turned on the shower and prevented showering. No maintenance crew on site to fix it. No replacement room. Very thin bed linen. I think they just throw unstuffed Duvet covers on the bed. Old| scratched tables. Chair stunk like feet. Affordable & very close to a lot of things including Times square.

I stayed hear many years back and was very pleased. This time I was very disappointed. Check in was slow and very backed up for as many desk people they had. I requested a ball view room for my wifes first time to NYC. The room did have this view but also came with a non working tv and badly stained carpet. After asking several times the tv couldn't not be fixed. They where unable to move us to a different room till morning. The new room did not have a ball view that we paid extra for and there was no refrigerator like our first room. I was very saddened and disappointed in how the staff handled these issues.

After checking in| I can see why.  The hotel is run down and in need of a facelift.  The employees or friendly and helpful end in a great location.,May 27| 2021,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The staff at the Millennium was extremely accommodating and courteous. So much so that whatever the hotel may have lacked because| of the age of the property| I would happily stay there again. There is something to say for hotel staff that goes out of their way to make our you stay pleasant.,May 27| 2021,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Good location if you want to be in within walking distance of Time Square and several other key site. You will need to plan for parking as street parking will be a challenge. The rooms are good and comfortable with limited amenities.

Staff was rude elevators weren't working properly. Their system was down all the time. Asked for help to get a room for early check in or pay extra they didn't bother to even check or help accommodate they just gave a quick and straight NO!.Before flying in I called to ask for these accommodations and the night operator was so rude asked me 3 times if I was sure I wanted to be transferred to front desk that they were so busy and most likely i was going to be on hold for a long time or they were not going to answer my call I said that's fine I'll wait and she was mad about that too.,May 24| 2021,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Staff had many problems| and were not willing to assist guests to solve these problems. The card to my room did not work and I was told to "deal with it."

Long lines for check in| only a couple of staff members working for check in. The first night the streets were closed and couldn't access the hotel at all for 2 hours and when we called the hotel they brushed us off saying we need to ask the police for directions to get to the hotel.

This property was terrible. It’s listed on Expedia as doubletree by Hilton Millennium Times Square. When you Google that name a hotel on 40th street comes up with great reviews. So I booked the room. The day of arrival I went to check in only to find that it’s the wrong property. The property I booked is on 44th street. I was bewildered because I googled it yet again and it came up as the property I was standing in (in which the front desk is telling me I don’t have a reservation). Turns out to find the property I booked I needed to type in only “Millenium Times Square”. Yep that’s right completely leaving off the Hilton name. Upon check in I figured out why. The lobby was ok. The front desk clerk was clueless about hilton honors etc. He checked me into a room and gave me an empty key holder. I said to him I think you forget the key. He responded “no our key card machine is down right now anytime you need to go up please see security”. I thought ok no big deal I’ll have dinner and come back it will be fixed. Nope! It was like this the entire weekend. I had to see security to escort back to my room every time I needed to go up. I finally get to the long awaited room. It’s a disaster! There is not one towel in the bathroom|  not even a face towel. There is no shower curtain on the tub and the room stinks of old cigarettes. To make matters worse the paint is peeling in the bathroom badly. The entire room needs to be renovated. New room change is same way. 6 HOURS to get towels!!,May 22| 2021,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

I booked a 2 night stay at this hotel and I was completely disappointed!!First| upon checking in and going to our room the key card did not work. No problem| i know it happens. I go down to the front desk to find a line of people with the same issue. We are then told they key card system is down and to go tonthe room and wait to be let in by security. No time frame was given| only that they woule be there as soon as possible. Again| things happen| I get it. I leave and return later that evening and the cards still do not work but a temporary card is issued but we are asked to return them the next day. Next day| the cards did not work again. I'm annoyed| but again things happen.The next issue I encountered was a clogged bathroom sink. After washing our hands the water never drained. Upon reporting it| maintenance came and drained the sink| using our waste baskets| leaving the floor soaked. He left and came back throwing towels on the floor and saying the sink was empty but he needed to come back with a snake - leaving the wet towels and a bent hanger in the sink. Again| I left for the afternoon and returned later that evening to the exact same mess he left - never returning to fix the sink. We ended up having to wash our hands and brush our teeth over the bathtub. Aside from those incredible inconveniences... the blankets look rather warn and over used and there are no amenities (which could be due to COVID.Overall I was very dissatisfied with my stay here!!,May 17| 2021,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

I booked a 2 night stay at this hotel and I was completely disappointed!!First| upon checking in and going to our room the key card did not work. No problem| i know it happens. I go down to the front desk to find a line of people with the same issue. We are then told they key card system is down and to go tonthe room and wait to be let in by security. No time frame was given| only that they woule be there as soon as possible. Again| things happen| I get it. I leave and return later that evening and the cards still do not work but a temporary card is issued but we are asked to return them the next day. Next day| the cards did not work again. I'm annoyed| but again things happen.The next issue I encountered was a clogged bathroom sink. After washing our hands the water never drained. Upon reporting it| maintenance came and drained the sink| using our waste baskets| leaving the floor soaked. He left and came back throwing towels on the floor and saying the sink was empty but he needed to come back with a snake - leaving the wet towels and a bent hanger in the sink. Again| I left for the afternoon and returned later that evening to the exact same mess he left - never returning to fix the sink. We ended up having to wash our hands and brush our teeth over the bathtub. Aside from those incredible inconveniences... the blankets look rather warn and over used and there are no amenities (which could be due to COVID.Overall I was very dissatisfied with my stay here!!,May 17| 2021,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The room had a weird smell from the minute I walked in. Also the carpet was very dirty and to top it off their system went down and security had to come up with me to open my door. I was very disappointed because I heard great things about this hotel.,May 17| 2021,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Hotel is run down..,May 16| 2021,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
The hotel staff was very accommodating! The only downfall was that due to what I would assume is COVID restrictions we didn’t have what I would think would be in the room otherwise. We had no cups.. we had no coffee in the room... and strangely no washcloths,May 16| 2021,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Well the hotel is in a good location| walking distance from Times Square. The room was terrible there was red stains on the carpet| cigarettes burns on the carpet| a smell of cigarettes| wallpaper was coming off| there was a crack on the bathroom ceiling| and there was something spilled on the outside of window witch was obstructing the view the main attraction. I will say the staff was nice but there key system also did go down while at our stay witch was inconvenient. What I got from my stay is that you give up one ether a nice room and no view or get a view with bad room. Would I stay at this hotel probably not.,May 16| 2021,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

I’m not one to complain but this hotel is DISGUSTING. We booked this hotel for my birthday trip to arrive to a “standard” room for one night since we extended our trip and we’re staying in a “superior” room for the rest of the stay. Our standard room smelled stale| the chair for the desk was stained and looked unclean. The lights in the hallway by the door didn’t work and neither did the lamps on the desk and nightstand| we had no shower curtain and there was vomit running down the outside of the windows. There was an ice bucket| but no bags or cups. The tv did not work and the carpet was badly stained. We complained and the front desk said that they would send a maintenance guy to fix those things| but did not offer anything. We decided not to complain since we were changing rooms the next day and we had booked a more expensive| “better” room. Well the room wasn’t better. It also smelled stale| the lamp on my side of the bed didn’t work. The plug in the bathroom looked like it was about to electrocute you and didn’t work until I reset it 3 times| there was no mini fridge| and there was hair ALL OVER THE PLACE. Black hair on the bathroom floors| on the bed over| on our “new” towels in the bathroom. Disgusting. This was such a disappointment and we truly expected more especially since carrying the “Hilton” name. I will never stay at a Hilton again. I have no idea why this has 4 stars.

When we checked in | instant disappointment is all I can describe. The room was filthy. There was a pasty white residue on top of the dresser the tv was on. The bathroom floor looked like it hadn’t been mopped during the past few stays. The smoke detector was covered in plastic wrap. The mirror was cracked on the closet. The furniture had water stains and looked warped. The drawers on the dresser were about to fall off. There was missing pictures off the wall. The room was horrendous. I had a manager come to the room to see for themselves| and to see how they would fix the problem. They were kind enough to offer me one of their best rooms to fix the situation| when in reality they gave me another standard room on a higher floor the next night. Nothing special about the room other than it was clean enough to stay in. Highly disappointed. The pictures posted don’t reflect the rooms in current condition. Staff was for the most part friendly.  Good location if you plan on visiting Times Square| as it’s a very close walk.

The hotel staff was nice. But we were shocked to go into our room that was “cleaned” but we are pretty sure was used for an hour our two and then given to us. The wall paper was falling off| the towels had brown stains and smelled| there was literally a HOLE filled with GARBAGE behind my sisters bed. Our little cleanliness welcome package was found opened in our room. I will never stay here again and will be active about letting my friends know not to. It was so bad my sister and I left at 5:00 am to get on the first train out that we could find. I’m staying at a much nicer hotel on my return to NYC Monday. Seriously don’t stay here unless you are looking for a place for a one night stand.,May 2| 2021,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

When first going in the room it was stuffy. The tub had mold all around it and the tub was stopped up. When you cut the shower on the water was spraying everywhere. I paid $200 for 1 night and the room didn’t even have a fridge or microwave in it. It was the worse experience and I wouldn’t recommend anyone staying here. The only good thing about it is the location and the access to a lot of things in the area.

I could write a book on how bad my stay was and I only was there for about 20 hours.  First off they don't have baggage storage due to Covid| so be prepared to take your things with you or find an alternative luggage storage option.  After I checked in I left my bags in the room to go eat and returned to them being gone.  The hotel had made a mistake and the bellmen moved them to a different room on accident.  (so no storage but they can move bags? seems odd right)  It took them over an hour to get my bags back to me because the bell man was "on break| sorry"  The bathroom is outdated| the windows were dirty and their were stains in my carpet.  I also paid $50 for a late check out and while sitting and relaxing I had maids try to come in three times even though I had told them I had a late checkout.  Worst Hilton property I ever stayed at.,Apr 26| 2021,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

traveled all the way from CT with my wife and children.... 1st room was on 44th floor| but so dirty stains everywhere and run down| bathroom moldy| sent me and family to a second room on 38th floor which was not even cleaned yet.   Still had dirty towels on floor and trash etc.  we waited for 45 minutes while they verified room condition as if i would be lying.   Then manager named Kristen walked me personally to another room which was newly renovated and i just accepted because at least it was new and clean for my children during COVID.  She promised she would send the key up with someone and in the mean time my family and i moved with all of our bags again down to the 31 floor and waited for 25 minutes.  After no one showing up i went down again to the front desk and they gave me a set of keys.  I returned to the room indicated to me and shown to me personally by the manager and the door would not open.  when i looked at the keys they had given me keys to a completey different room with no mention of the change.  I went back down and they informed me that this room was same as other but that they had just booked the other room that they promised me and instead put me in a unrenovated room with mold all over the bathroom| pee stains on the floor| stains all over ceiling| ceiling in bathroom falling down. paint missig everywhere| smellling old because of the unclean carpet| carpet had white stains everywhere.

This hotel was listed as a 4 star hotel. When we checked in| the standard towels weren’t there. It took 45 mins and 3 calls to get someone to bring us towels. When I warmed up my shower| yellow liquid started dripping from the bathroom ceiling which we ended up wiping off. The room and elevators smelled like cigarettes even though it’s a non smoking hotel. Check in guy was rude when I asked him what floor I would be on. Overall| it was just a place I used to sleep while visiting the city| I will not be back.,Apr 22| 2021,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Stayed in the superior king bed room with Times Square view. Check in was quick and easy but when I finally got to the room I was very disappointed how dated it looked and around the bathtub was very moldy and black. The room did not match the pictures at all when I went to the front desk she changed the room and it was a little better but still dated and moldy she also said the pictures are exaggerated. A little disappointed because I would of picked another hotel if I knew it didn’t look the same as the pictures. Would love if the hotel posted actual pictures of the rooms but besides that the location was great and the parking was $50 a night.,Apr 22| 2021,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Prime location| only steps from Times Square. I paid extra to have a room with city view and it was not worth it| you can't see much. Overall the room was clean but old. Parking is right across the hotel but it's around $25 per night. The hotel doesn't have luggage storage service| so if you get there before check in time you will need to look for a place to storage your luggage| same for check out. I found a storage place two blocks from the hotel and they do it for $10 per bag.,Apr 21| 2021,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Not cleaning rooms bath on bad condition blankets so duty also the pillo they no change   Nothing if is not visible to change,Apr 21| 2021,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
This location is in terrible shape. Rooms have dirty corners| stuff stuck on the carpet| paint peeling on the bathroom ceiling| the hardest most uncomfortable beds| thread born comforters(they look to be 3-4 years old at minimum)| no fridge in the room| closet door were missing but the hardware is still there| all the furniture is chipped and stained...just horrible condition. I travel for a living and have premium status with Hilton so I was shocked at the condition. Even the elevators were filthy and the same trash that was there when I checked in was still there two days later. Does anyone clean this place?  The location is FANTASTIC but know what you’re getting when you make your reservation. It’s awful. Such a huge disappointment!!  I will never go back and will not recommend this property to anyone.,Apr 21| 2021,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

This hotel was listed as a 4 star hotel. When we checked in| the standard towels weren’t there. It took 45 mins and 3 calls to get someone to bring us towels. When I warmed up my shower| yellow liquid started dripping from the bathroom ceiling which we ended up wiping off. The room and elevators smelled like cigarettes even though it’s a non smoking hotel. Check in guy was rude when I asked him what floor I would be on. Overall| it was just a place I used to sleep while visiting the city| I will not be back.,Apr 22| 2021,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Stayed in the superior king bed room with Times Square view. Check in was quick and easy but when I finally got to the room I was very disappointed how dated it looked and around the bathtub was very moldy and black. The room did not match the pictures at all when I went to the front desk she changed the room and it was a little better but still dated and moldy she also said the pictures are exaggerated.

This hotel was not what I was expecting. The carpets were dirty with black stains. The windows were dirty on the outside which gave me a foggy view of Times Square.

***READ BEFORE YOU BOOK***I am so disappointed| as a native New Yorker I expected more from this hotel| especially from what I paid! On the website the rooms look beautiful. Don't be fooled! The room smelled like cigarettes| sweat and despair. There was stains everywhere. I only gave it two stars because after I complained they changed my room to a semi decent one| with a nice view. I booked a deluxe king for two nights. Never again! If you are desperate| don't care about cleanliness| and just need a quick place to sleep then stay here. Otherwise run! On top of that they charged me "Resort fees"| based on the cleanliness issue| I wouldn't use the gym even if it came with a free night.,Apr 15| 2021,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

I'm very disappointed in Expedia for allowing me to book this hotel under the Hilton name. I usually exclusively stay at Hilton hotels and even though there were hotels at a lpwer price i made this selection because i was under the impression it was "Hilton". Upon arrival i realized quickly there was nothing Hilton about this very old poorly kept property. I was so confused upon arrival Inasked the receptionist if i was at the Double Tree by Hilton and he looked so confused telling me we are under several different names. Be advised this hotel is NOTHING Hilton. Moving forward I will no longer book with expedia as this is the aecond thime this has happened to me and I even used my expedia points towards this hotel thinking it was gonna be a good choice.

The property misrepresented itself with the photos online. We had two rooms and neither matched the photos. We had to clean our bathroom due to the tub not looking as clean. The smell of marijuana was overwhelming throughout the hotel but especially in my daughters room almost to the point where they could not sleep there in a hotel that claims to be smoke-free. This is a policy that is clearly not enforced. I would not stay at this hotel again.,Apr 10| 2021,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The property misrepresented itself with the photos online. We had two rooms and neither matched the photos. We had to clean our bathroom due to the tub not looking as clean. The smell of marijuana was overwhelming throughout the hotel but especially in my daughters room almost to the point where they could not sleep there in a hotel that claims to be smoke-free. This is a policy that is clearly not enforced. I would not stay at this hotel again.,Apr 10| 2021,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Great location| awesome view and attentive staff especially James at the front desk!I didn’t like that housekeeping did not come tend to our room but understand due to Covid a lot is still being affected. Our room phone was not connected had to use the one in the hallway. Would stay here again because of price and location,Apr 8| 2021,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
I did not like the change made to my reservation. I booked a double bed and was forced to a single bed . They had to bring a removable bed that was highly uncomfortable for the kids. We ended up using one bed for the 4 off us.,Apr 8| 2021,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

I am very disappointed in my stay the room was waste more than I expected for what I paid. I picked the wrong choice because I was supposed to have free parking end end up paying extra 150 for parking because the parking lot that they used was full every time I tried to park. And the person that I checked in with was very rude.,Apr 5| 2021,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Hotel is horrible. Everything was falling apart: wall paper| bathtub drain| lamp shade. Bed comforter or the piece of paper that it felt like was dirty. Room had no wash rags I had to wait 4 hrs just to wash my face after a road trip to NY. Bathtub is dirty. This is by far is listed WORSE HOTEL IVE EVER BEEN TO. The bottom of the food chain in regards to hotels. I didn’t even stay the night. DO NOT HO HERE,Apr 4| 2021,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Sheets were stained with blood. Was never provided with a rollaway bed| housekeeping said they "forgot" to bring it up then they ran out after I called for the third time.

It was located where we wanted to be that's all we liked about the hotel. What we didn't like was that there wasn't a refrigerator in the room and where it would have been the door was really loose as if it would fall off| the paint was chipping on the bathroom ceiling and the shower looked really out dated and a bit yellowish when it should have been white. The windows were dirty with greese marks from peoples fourheads from looking out the windows. We couldn't find ice machines on the floor and not many accessible power outlets in the room. The pictures are deceiving| because the room looks a lot bigger in the pictures. The smell of weed (marijuana) outside the hotel and all over Timesquare was ridiculous. We won't be staying in Timesquare again.,Apr 3| 2021,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Overall| this was not the worst experience| but it was a far cry from luxury. For me| staying in the city for approx 48 hours| the affordable cost and great location outweighed the otherwise unappealing features. I will say that the standard of cleanliness| in my experience| fell considerably short of the normal standard at other Hilton-owned hotels. Unless there is a major renovation in the future| I will not return. I will include a full list of pros and cons below| but here’s the bottom line:This is NOT a 4-star hotel. If you want a great location for a great price for a short time| AND you are willing to stay in an outdated place with limited amenities/frills| THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU! If you prefer top-notch comfort and cleanliness| head to the Marriott marquis across the street. Not enough room on Expedia for my list of pros and cons| but will post on Yelp.,Apr 3| 2021,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

I really resent that the $50 “resort fee” isn’t included with the hotel price- go ahead and factor that in with this hotel. Apparently it’s done to avoid city taxes.... so shady. Our room had a stained carpet| threadbare bedspreads and- worst of all- no shower curtain! Don’t assume that because this is a Hilton that you will get standardized quality.

The property is beautiful| it's classic New York.The wallpaper in the room was falling off| there was a water leak in the ceiling at some point because the ceiling was torn and hanging. I tried calling 15 times before I arrived to confirm my room with 0 answers. I was given a room without a view even though I paid extra for the deluxe room| kind of the whole point of booking a hotel in Time Square.

The property is beautiful| it's classic New York.The wallpaper in the room was falling off| there was a water leak in the ceiling at some point because the ceiling was torn and hanging. I tried calling 15 times before I arrived to confirm my room with 0 answers. I was given a room without a view even though I paid extra for the deluxe room| kind of the whole point of booking a hotel in Time Square. When I called from the hotel phone in the room I was put on hold 4 times with no answer.,Mar 29| 2021,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Stayed here over a long weekend. Steps away at some times later. You pay for what you get. Good if you won’t be in your room for long.,Mar 29| 2021,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

My stay wasn’t bad at all but when I checked in the guy behind the counter said oh I up graded you and then asked for my card.

The room did not look like in the picture. My room was supposed to have a view of time square it did not. The beds were very tiny and uncomfortable. While there they did not clean our room.

This hotel is borderline. It isn't very clean| only partially updated| and the staff is skimpy. I wasn't ever able to get anyone to answer the phone either by calling in-house or calling the number directly. There were extremely long waits at the elevators| and no security. The entire hotel smelled like marijuana and there were a lot of people hanging around the lobby| elevators| and outside. I do not recommend this hotel. Also be careful if you do reserve.

We had to ask to change the room. The air conditioning filter had not been changed in a long time| it had a super thick layer of dust and dirt. In times of pandemic| where in my opinion one of the things that should be prioritized is cleaning. In the other room the A/C filter was not clean either| but better than the previous one. Something that we have never experienced before| it was the horrible static in the duvet that we cover ourselves with when sleeping. You could see in the dark the flashes of static electricity and sound| as well as the effect on our body.

Upon arrival we were greeted by 7-10 people by the front door smoking weed. The line to check in was long and slow. The first room we were assigned reeked of weed and was possibly occupied or just not cleaned. The smoke detector was taped off and there was trash all over. The next room was more of a kit than a finished product. Most of the parts were there but you put it together yourself. We had to request several missing items. ie. comforters and pillows. The lobby was an adventure.

The hotel had a great location.  The room was clean & we had a great view of Times Square. During the weekend the line for the elevators created heavy traffic. What was our biggest hassle was the door latch which locked our door from the inside. This happened twice before we had to tape it down in order to not be locked out of our room. Lastly calling the front desk from any phone is pointless|  they won't answer.  The only way to talk to hotel staff is by standing in front of them.

This is the worst hotel I’ve stayed at|| do not book|  phone wasn’t connected|| not clean|| had to wait over an hour for clean towels,Mar 15| 2021,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

They offer free Parking but you have to leave your car there. I was there for a week and couldn't take my car out intil check out or it was going to be a $70 fee,Mar 15| 2021,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The overall hotel was nice| but the room we stayed in was not great. There were weird stains on the wallpaper and that was also peeling off in some spots. The rings on the shower head and handles to help get up we’re not even attached to the wall and there were also weird red stains on the tile in the bathroom. The staff was friendly enough| but it was very hard to get a hold of anyone to just get some cups.,Mar 15| 2021,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
The hotel had a great location.  The room was clean & we had a great view of Times Square. During the weekend the line for the elevators created heavy traffic. What was our biggest hassle was the door latch which locked our door from the inside. This happened twice before we had to tape it down in order to not be locked out of our room. Lastly calling the front desk from any phone is pointless|  they won't answer.  The only way to talk to hotel staff is by standing in front of them.

First I must say that all the pictures of the rooms are wayyy off. My room and my family members room looked like we stayed at the Super 8 motel| and I would never stay there. All together we had three rooms| none of the rooms were cleaned well. The bathroom tub & sink didnt even look like they were disenfected. I had to lay a towel in the tub when I bathed because it just did not look sanitary. I requested if they could change my room and was told no| but the individuals on the line before and after me were able to move their rooms. I felt discriminated against and disregarded. I've stayed at properties that had less rating but beautiful room accomodations. Finally| we felt as if the mattresses were made out of wood. Not one peaceful night of rest| so disappointed in such a high profile property.Never Again.. for business or pleasure.,Mar 8| 2021,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

I felt like the whole place was dated| there was no coffee in the room to have in the morning| no cups either I had to ask room service for cups. The bathroom water was green| I made a bath and the water was green! The plug didn’t work I had to pull the plug with my hand.

We stood in room 2803 from February 26th to the 28th and the bathtub was always leaking when me or my girlfriend took a shower and the bath filled itself up without us wanting it to. We didn’t have a mini fridge in our room so we didn’t have any place to store our drinks or food. Also when it was time for checkout there wasn’t that much of elevators working so I ended up checking out almost an hour after checkout time.,Mar 5| 2021,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Was incredibly disappointed with my two night stay at this hotel. My room did not have ac. Apparently during the winter the hotel switches to heater only and the occupants are not able to change to ac is the room is too hot. I was told to open the windows if the room was too hot! My room did not have a refrigerator either. Lastly| the occupants from the room adjacent to mine were smoking marijuana. I called to complain three times and nothing was done to stop these individuals from doing as they pleased.

The location is great| some staff is nice and some are just plain rude. The room is dirty with molding on the shower. To top it off| we were missing a thermostat and the room was hot. We called multiple times| we finally got someone to bring us a thermostat cover and he even asked us “what do you want this for?if it’s too hot the building is kept as 65 no exceptions ”. Only to find that the thermostat had no batteries. Horrible| we called and called and they were rude and ignoring our calls. Thankfully we were only there for the weekend.

The only good thing about the hotel is its location super close to Times Square. Hotel needs some remodeling. At check out time you need to wait at least 45-60 mins (never seen something like that before) to get in the elevator from how much I had to wait the only solution I had at that point is to take the stairs from the 36th floor down to the lobby! Not just that .. when you check in the staff act all nice and tell you sir we will waive the resort fee don’t worry about it we’re only going to charge you the deposit $50 per night. Then you find out the charge you $28.69 per night for the resort fee when you call to ask they all deny that sentence they say to everyone it happened to me and 5 of my friends.

The location is convenient & the bed was comfortable| other than that it’s a 2/10. I won’t be back. It was not clean at all| the bathroom was out dated| the shower had bad water pressure| leftover hair from the previous guest in the shower| a rusty drain. The bedroom windows were filthy and the remote to the tv had sauce or dried food on it. I reserved a queen room and during check in was informed they no longer have a Queen room available in even tho I reserved and paid in advance and they then gave me a room with a double bed.,Feb 16| 2021,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
The room that i purchased was nothing like what i received. Check-in took forever because only two people were working the desk and the line was out the door.  My room was decent for a King room w/ a view and that's if you even want to call it a view. Majority of the view was company buildings instead of times square. I expected a nice| relaxing tub to relax and mellow out but instead i got a dingy tub with two dirt rings around it. Overall| it wasn't worth the price and i wouldn't stay here again.,Feb 16| 2021,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

So I checked in for Valentine’s Day with my fiancé | then the Water in the entire HOTEL goes out for 3 hrs! No water at all. Almost every guest complained . I couldn’t check out and book at another hotel bcus of the expensive rates in Times Square. Then the water was cold the next couple days . No Hot water and they blamed it on Con Edison,Feb 15| 2021,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
The location of this hotel is very close to Times Square! However because of this| check in/check out is a very busy time and the staff isn’t the nicest nor the most patient. Not to mention| the 6 elevators that the hotel offers are extremely slow and full to the max during these times. I will say the room was very clean| the staff kept things neat for us with fresh towels even when we didn’t ask. Lastly| the view was pretty cool of Times Square and the room was quite spacious.,Feb 15| 2021,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
I was impressed by what we got for what we paid. I was a bit worried with all the negative reviews but you also have to consider that you are not paying a 5 star hotel. Great location and nice spacious rooms. Would stay again.,Feb 15| 2021,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Everything was extremely horrible. Dirty bathtub| broken stuff. No cups| no fridge| not even a remote for TV. Customer service horrible. I really want a refund. This felt like a shelter.,Feb 14| 2021,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Location is great. Beds are super hard and you can't control the temperature in your room. They have it set for all rooms so I roasted for 3 days and I have a high tolerance for heat.

Convenient location in Times Square| however the bed was the most uncomfortable bed I have ever tried to sleep on . It was thin with hard lumps all over and the pillows were flat as a pancake.I understand with COVID-19 the staffing is poor |however upon check in I was informed if I wanted my room cleaned after my first night I would have to call and request it. The room was dusty| water stains on the dresser and the remote did not work .,Feb 3| 2021,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Room Carpet needs to be cleaned| it carries an odor.Front desk never answers but front desk worker's are very polite & helpful.I felt very comfortable & safe during my stay. The tv shades darker the longer you watch it & the window view is amazing but should very much be cleaned. With covid restrictions going on I'll let certain things pass just hoping by march this hotel can actually show me a great time!💜 -Ja'neya Curves,Feb 2| 2021,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

okay so let me start off by saying this is a beautiful hotel in a great location! we rented a car for a day and when we called the hotel they actually validate parking but there isn’t any in and out| you’re in or you’re out they only validate parking one time. the room was okay| there was what APPEARED to be a red wine stain on the floor(hoping) but the tv didn’t work cause someone stole the cables to it and the phone didn’t work at all. we checked out at 12 (thank god for late check out) and our flight home wasn’t till 6:00 that evening. we asked if we could leave our bags with the hotel till our flight and they said due to covid they cannot hold any bags anymore. annoying but makes sense. so we lugged them to a friends house to hold till we left later. so. if you don’t have friends in the area but you have a late flight you should figure out your bag situation ahead of time or book a earlier flight to leave right away because they will not hold them.,Jan 25| 2021,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

I thought this was a prestigious hotel| unfortunately we found a cockroach in our room. The hotel only discounted 30 dollars and moved our room. I did not expect to go through this experience. Very unpleasant.,Dec 22| 2020,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Quick and easy. Great location,Dec 21| 2020,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Location is great! Close to everything for walking. DO NOT GET A TIME SQUARE VIEW!the light goes thru your windows (yes even with the curtains closed) and its soooo loud. people yelling| cars honking and revving all night.also the beds are TERRIBLE. Hard as a rock and completely hard and flat pillows.,Dec 21| 2020,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

I forgot his name already but we had a nice conversation when he checked me in. I surprised my girlfriend by booking at a superior room ball drop view room| we loved it| it was our 2 years anniversary! I set up ballons and flower petals all around the room and she got emotional| the room was perfect nice and clean. Also I checked in 2 hours earlier then the regular check in time which was at 4| it was ready so the guy behind the desk asked him manager if there’s any room available at the time since I got a ball drop view. He told he upgraded my room for no additional charge and I was excited| the room was bigger. My girl and I had a great stay| we had great time it was fun yk what i’m saying| will definitely recommend !,Dec 13| 2020,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

For the price you pay per night is sad and dissatisfied in the cleanliness. The showers had mold and the tile was stained like a motel 6. The service is also sad..... all they said was sorry no form of a discount or accommodations for the dirty bathroom I had to stay in for 10 days.

It was ok. Not worth the money with extra fees. Be sure to look around for the cheapest deals.  If you get free parking it's only for 1 day and ther 1II 8.e's no in and out service. When you park your vehicle it must remain in the offsite garage until the day you checkout unless you are willing to pay a fee of $65 or $35 each day you remove vechile from garage. The bed was very firm and the down comforter was super thin. It took particularly an half day before the room warmed up. When I requested an additional blanket| a super thin one was provided. I slept with my coat covering me.,Dec 10| 2020,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

First of all the was no air conditioning in the room. I tried to call the manager and the front desk staff from the room phone multiple times| no answer. So I went to talk to a nice lady at the front desk| she said that there is only one pipe in the facility so it’s either ac or heat and they had the heat on| mind you the highs this weekend were in the 70’s. So she offered to have someone open our window and turn our heat off. Didn’t work. I went to talk to the manager and asked her for a refund| manager was not polite or apologetic at all. Barely said two words to me and I was very polite with her. I ended up leaving and finding another hotel down the street. Overall the room was at best decent. Bed was hard as a rock and lumpy| seems like they need new mattresses. Overall| very disappointing stay.

The overall qualitly of the room was bad | the rooms heating system was not working and my fiance is anemic so she got sick. Tried to switch hotels rooms but apparently none were available.,Nov 2| 2020,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
I was given 3 different rooms because all the rooms smelled like smoke and some was dirty. Every room was outdated and the city view was of the buildings next door blocking any city view and the windows was coted with a dirt film so the view was better at night.,Nov 2| 2020,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
This hotel had 0 amenities and when we booked the hotel we had no idea that there wasn't going to be any breakfast| lunch| or dinner. The hotel phones were broken| they were unresponsive every time we tried to get in contact with them and when we tried to check in| our reservation wasn't in their system. We had to wait 30 minutes just to be able to solve that issue. They are very slow and anytime you have to check in and check out be prepared to wait 30 minutes to do so.

Nothing special about this property| I made some request while checking in that were not done.The staff didn’t have any knowledge about the area restaurants and closing times| they were very rude since the dirt moment.No room service was provided to us| we called about 5 times to get new towels at least and front desk never replied.Also a housekeeper opened our door by mistake at 7am| then she said never mind you’re not in my list.I personally work with hospitality and this is not what I was expecting.I understand the whole situation with the pandemic but we are paying for a service| at least a welcome or good morning would change your impression but not even that. If you have employees that treat guests like that| don’t expect too many good reviews.,Oct 31| 2020,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The overall qualitly of the room was bad | the rooms heating system was not working and my fiance is anemic so she got sick. Tried to switch hotels rooms but apparently none were available.,Nov 2| 2020,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
I was given 3 different rooms because all the rooms smelled like smoke and some was dirty. Every room was outdated and the city view was of the buildings next door blocking any city view and the windows was coted with a dirt film so the view was better at night.,Nov 2| 2020,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
This hotel had 0 amenities and when we booked the hotel we had no idea that there wasn't going to be any breakfast| lunch| or dinner. The hotel phones were broken| they were unresponsive every time we tried to get in contact with them and when we tried to check in| our reservation wasn't in their system. We had to wait 30 minutes just to be able to solve that issue. They are very slow and anytime you have to check in and check out be prepared to wait 30 minutes to do so. They are very slow.,Nov 1| 2020,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

With the pandemic going on these rooms are given away for low cost| with that said anybody goes to these hotels because of the price. I bet that if this wasn’t going on you would see more upscale. The location is the best of things have changed so much in NYC because of the coronavirus. Be careful in time square. A lot of shady people asking for money and selling drugs. The hotel looks better in pictures then in real life. The room is good| for sleeping.

The first room was nasty.... The second room they gave us was no better. The comforter on the bed had feathers coming out of it. The walls had old soda stains on them.

Nothing was unique about this stay. When I arrived I noticed right away there was eyelashes on the lamp from the couple before us. What kind of cleaning service do they offer?

There was a leak in the ceiling in the bathroom first night. Next day after we moved they shut the water off with no notice. Unable to shower or use restroom let alone wash our hands in the age of Covid-19. Every time we stepped outside of hotel you could smell THC in front of property.

There was a leak in the ceiling in the bathroom first night. Next day after we moved they shut the water off with no notice. Unable to shower or use restroom let alone wash our hands in the age of Covid-19. Every time we stepped outside of hotel you could smell THC in front of property. Front desk staff have major attitude problems and poor customer service.,Oct 17| 2020,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The location is perfect! But the room was basic| bathroom was dirty| waited 45 mins for a elevator that was crowded because there’s only a limit of 2 per elevator and I had to walk down 23 flights because I had to check out.

Nice lobby... good location... friendly checkin... time square view was nice| rooms were a little out dated. No fridge or coffee in the room or hotel.

Horrible customer service. They almost never picked up the phone. You’d spend 20 minutes trying to talk to someone. But they did come things like late check out for free when you pointed out how long you had to wait. Got to our room and the bathroom hadn’t been cleaned which was gross but they moved us to another room right away. So I mean I was left with a weird taste in my mouth about the whole experience. Also everyone at the desk was rude😖,Sep 29| 2020,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
The room with the broken air changed me to another and I didn't have a fridge. I said I needed it because I was with 2 children and they told me that they would solve any the next day and it was fake,Sep 29| 2020,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Horrible customer service. They almost never picked up the phone. You’d spend 20 minutes trying to talk to someone. But they did come things like late check out for free when you pointed out how long you had to wait. Got to our room and the bathroom hadn’t been cleaned which was gross but they moved us to another room right away. So I mean I was left with a weird taste in my mouth about the whole experience. Also everyone at the desk was rude😖,Sep 29| 2020,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
The room with the broken air changed me to another and I didn't have a fridge. I said I needed it because I was with 2 children and they told me that they would solve any the next day and it was fake,Sep 29| 2020,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The outside of the hotel was nice. The bell hop was on lunch and he was the only one to take your luggage to your room. At first we were told to wait for him then we asked how long| then we were told he’s on lunch. I had 2 towels in the room| no washcloths or hand towels. When I called they did remedy the situation. Usually a hotel room has cups| there weren’t any. I had wiped off the table before I used it| and thank god I did. It took a long time to reach the hotel staff on the phone. The day I was checking out| a hotel staff entered my room at 10am| and saw me on the bed and quickly closed her door. I’ve stayed at other hotel during the pandemic and the convince store/cafe is open| but there’s were closed. The best thing about this hotel is the location| and free parking to be honest. Maybe they put more care into the suites but I won’t be back to find out!,Sep 26| 2020,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Walls are so thin you can hear everything from every side of your walls. Nothing is private here. Some staff are not friendly| not helpful and they laugh at you or judge you with whatever you look or appearance. But the rooms are clean and hallways are kept in clean and good condition. So that's a plus point for them. Other than that well they are ok.,Sep 25| 2020,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
The hotel is kind of ran down | first room I got leaking right on top of toilet | moved us on the third day thank you | house keeping not a priority| what ever We need it got it right away but we had to ask !! Could not for a better location!!,Sep 25| 2020,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

front desk and housekeeping NEVER Answered the phone. It was mission impossible to get towels or anything. Then the toilet flooded and we told themAnd hours passed by and no one ever came. Then the entire room flooded and we went to front desk to alert them again and no one still came. They gave us another room but it didn’t matter bc our flight was a few hours away so needless to SAY OUR LAST DAY AND NIGHT THERE WAS HORRID. Don stay there if u have a choice.,Sep 24| 2020,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

TERRIBLE!!! we got a deluxe room. When we walked inside the room there it smelt like complete cigarettes smoke as well as marijuana. There was nasty liquid like all over bed frame. I have pictures to prove| bathroom floors all dirty| mold inside the bathtub corners| I don’t even know if the sheets were changed because there were dirty sheets| I tried calling the front desk 20 times NO ANSWER. I then switched to a different room. I guess was a little better than last one but no difference. I shouldn’t have had to experience that first situation. Absolutely DISGUSTING. I will be uploading pictures and contacting higher management!!!! I will never ever stay here and I recommend nobody stays here. Customer service is HORRIBLE THEY NEVER ANSWER THE PHONE. There was a man in the room next door that kept us up all night. Banging on the door asking for whoever was in the room to let him in. He kept banging and screaming curse words. We tried calling downstairs because my friend and I were too scared to leave our room and go to the lobby because the man was outside screaming and banging on the hotel door for whomever was in the room with him to let him in. We had to sit through a big argument of theres the whole night. Downstairs was not answering phones at all.

I reserved a room on Friday night for a studio suite king size bed (ball drop view). Let me tell you that is far from what that was. I walked into a room that was only a full size bed with no view what so ever. They falsely advertised so they can bring in guests. I went back down immediately and told the receptionist this is not the room i reserved. Mind you there there about 3-4 other parties there for the same reason. All of them very upset as i was. They weren’t reasonable at all and i Kindly asked her to cancel the room so i can book else where. She did do that but the thing is i never got refunded for the room. Im furious.,Aug 3| 2020,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Long of the short I received several HIDDEN charges on my credit card I was not aware of after check out on Sunday July 12th. The dates listed are INCORRECT I checked in on Friday July 10th checked out on Sunday July 12th. The room was NEVER cleaned our entire stay. SECOND trip to NY and SECOND disappointing hotel stay in NY.

It was close to Times Square which was great and it’s right up from good morning America studio. Had view of New Years ball drop much smaller than what they have on tv. But it was still cool.  No fan in bathrooms. No fridge in rooms. On website it says they have parking but they don’t you have to go to garage across from hotel it ranges $55-$65 a day depending on your vehicle.

Upon check-in we were sent to the wrong room. With that| our keys didn’t work. Security let us in but then we had to wait in line again to get new keys.

The beds and pillows were not very comfortable| however| good enough for a one night stay.,Feb 27| 2020,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The location is awesome. The front desk and concerige were very nice and helpful.Lobby dark| but looks good.Housekeeping very friendly always saying hi.The hallways and rooms definitely needs upgrades.

We wouldn’t recommend this hotel again| you are paying for location only.  The room was clean and our room attendant was very polite| as well as the bell hop when it came to storing our luggage after checkout.

Tourist trap. Lobby is beautiful| rooms are awful. Thankfully the shower and beds were nice except an interesting stain| a moldy piece of pizza left behind it and gummy bears smooshed between the mattress? Staff was okay| not very accommodating or helpful. No coffee maker| fridge| and we had to request a maid service. Lesson learned though| wouldn’t stay here again. I recommend doing more research before spending money to stay here!,Jan 25| 2020,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Great location but needs updates! Paint peeling off the ceilings and walls and carpets very stained.,Jan 27| 2020,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Great location. Reasonable parking deals. The only complaint was the bed. Probably the hardest one I’ve experienced at a hotel.,Jan 26| 2020,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Tourist trap. Lobby is beautiful| rooms are awful. Thankfully the shower and beds were nice except an interesting stain| a moldy piece of pizza left behind it and gummy bears smooshed between the mattress? Staff was okay| not very accommodating or helpful. No coffee maker| fridge| and we had to request a maid service. Lesson learned though| wouldn’t stay here again. I recommend doing more research before spending money to stay here!,Jan 25| 2020,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Clean and comfortable hotel with nice staff and a very convenient location. This hotel is a great deal.,Jan 25| 2020,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
It was very close to Times Square and the two broadway shows we attended. The staff was attentive| friendly| and helpful.,Jan 24| 2020,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating.  They took their time to tell me how to get around the city.  One employee had actually clocked out for the day but took the time to walk me to the subway and show me how to use the transit system (they then went upstairs to get their car and go home).,Jan 20| 2020,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
I didn't like the $50 fee they charged because we reserved with Expedia.,Jan 20| 2020,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
The location of this property was perfect for us. It was only steps from the heart of Times Square and our show. I understand the hotel is old so repairs and maintenance needs are to be expected| but issues that are visible to guest should take priority. Fixtures hanging off the wall and holes in the walls is something a guest should never see. Overall| the condition of the property was ok. The front desk staff was pleasant. They were very friendly. We arrived very early| so they took our bags while we went out to explore. The cleanliness of our room was terrible. The floor and sink counter looked as if it had not been mopped and cleaned in a very long time. There was corrosion under the sink and it had been dripping onto the floor. The stain on the floor was very old. Dirt was left in the corner of the bathtub| and old urine stains were on the outside of toilet. Also| our listing stated we would have a mini refrigerator| but we didn’t. The next day| our room was not visited by housekeeping| and we had to call twice for fresh towels. The straw that broke the camels back is the bed. It felt like I was sleeping on the floor. My entire body was aching. I would not revisit or recommend this hotel based on the cleanliness of the room| housekeeping| and the comfort of the bed.,Jan 20| 2020,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Location of the hotel is the only positive.  Bed were  hard as a rock. No proper ventilation in the room.  Nasty bathroom. Sheets had hair on them and it wasn’t ours since we just had walked in.  Never again!,Jan 19| 2020,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
I would never give this hotel business. First| we arrived at 11:30 am and checked in--no room ready (that's ok) but we have "a special room for you." I had paid for a room with two double beds (there were 3 of us).  Give us your number and we'll call you when it's ready. We checked our bags & headed out. At 4 we had not heard from the hotel but we had dinner reservations so wanted to freshen up and relax. Got on line| got our room. Nothing was said. We got up to floor 45 to find a room with one king bed. Brought our things back downstairs. Back on line. Explained the situation to the clerk. He got the manager| they had overbooked their 2-bed rooms. They had upgraded our room and would bring in a cot. Not happy with their choice or lack of communication. Manager said we can cancel your reservation with no charge. Seriously? It's past 4| we've driven in from 4 hours away| have reservations and tickets to Phantom at 8. It's snowing. Sure--we'll just cancel the reservation and DO WHAT? So I said| fine but please make sure the cot is in the room and made up by the time we get back from the show at 11 pm. Of course| I am told. We left hotel at 5:30 and I stopped by the front desk to make sure the extra bed would be ready when we returned. Arrived back around 11:30 pm. Bed in corner standing up. Called front desk. Explained. Transferred to housekeeping. 15 minutes later| man who speaks NO English came in| put bed down| left. I had to move and make the bed myself at almost midnight.,Jan 19| 2020,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The first night we stayed in a room with an amazing view| but very uncomfortable bed. We spoke to Brian| and he moved us to a more updated room with a more comfortable bed| and said the other rooms were eventually going to be redone as well| better beds included.

Location was great for seeing shows. However| the beds are horrible and the pillows must be 20 years old. They give you one thin cover that looks so sad.

Also| at 1:00am an alarm went off that sent us into a panic and took 30 minutes for the hotel to tell us everything was fine. In the meantime| we heard the fire trucks - so clearly we were upset and then took us 1.5 hours to go back to sleep.

Run down property. Room with cot wasnt available even though i called a month in advance and was assured it would be. Family slept on 2 doubles that were like rocks. Pillows aweful too. Wife and i both got stiff necks. Bathroom was a diaster with the slowest tub drain you can imagine. Mold along the side. Disgusting. Staff downstairs were no better. 1 guy working while 3 stand around with a line out the door to get checked bags. Very rude.staff. Desk clerk was yelling at folks not to get in line if they were just checking.out. Others were complaining too. We heard a desk clerk say to someone| "you shouldnt have booked on a travel site if you wanted a king room" really unbeleivable!

The location of this property is the only positive selling point ... the hotel rooms are extremely outdated. The rooms were felt like they weren’t cleaned well enough| it’s an uncomfortable feeling. The comfort of the beds were terrible. The mattresses had body formed indentations in them. The hotel needs a total renovation! No basic amenities either like a Refrigerator or ice bucket. Nothing,Dec 25| 2019,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The hotel was great.  Very clean  and comfortable and the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating.  A little noisy at times but it is New York City and close to Times Square so to be expected.It would have been nice to have mini-fridges in the room.,Dec 18| 2019,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
This hotel is in a great location. Syed had a room available at 1130am which was great. However room condition as far as bathroom walls crumbling and of cleanliness was not good. I suspect bedding| towels replaced and tub cleaned was about it as dark long hair was all over bathroom floor and makeup brush on floor in room from previous guest. The view was great. Could see the ball drop. At check out  the there was 3 clerks| one doing all the work and the girls just talking. They directed me to the gentlemen who actually was working. He was kind enough to credit our resort fee for the condition of the room. Wish I had his name.,Dec 18| 2019,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Location was perfect| everything else was average and basic. The room looked dated and therefore looked unclean. There was no mini bar and not even a kettle.

Not so sure I would stay here again.  It was OKAY... very expensive for the room.  But expected that because of the location.  The heating system didn't work very well and it got cold at night.  Had to ask for an additional blanket for the bed.  The bathroom looked worn and needs an update.  But again -- can't beat the location.  Close to the subways and public transportation and the eating establishments.,Dec 16| 2019,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Great location and friendliness of all employees. The building is old and desperately needs some maintenance. Hotel: clean| employees really try to keep it cleanRoom: Wallpaper is all vracked and peeling| bleach stains in carpet| we got a corner room and one side was practically useless as it was stained with some white substance (from the outside).

This was not our first stay at the Millennium.  We really enjoy this hotel and the spacious room sizes.  It is located in the heart of the theatre district and all of our fun adventures were within walking distance.  It's an older hotel and our room showed some wear and tear in the bathroom where the door was sticking upon closing. Other than that we truly enjoy this hotel and would highly recommend. The concierge was helpful in obtaining tickets for an almost sold out show. Very helpful. We should mention the restaurant was nice but could use a few more choices on the menu. Only negative this year was the music playing throughout the main floor and restaurant...it was awful! At Christmas time we would have enjoyed hearing Christmas music.,Dec 10| 2019,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Grout needed to be redone or cleaned in shower and there was rust at the drain part of the tub.,Dec 2| 2019,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

We really enjoyed the stay at this hotel. The hotel is clean| the service is great and the staff members are very hospitable and friendly. The best part about the hotel is the proximity to times square (it's right around the corner of broadway street).,Nov 23| 2019,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Incredible location right off Times Square| friendly staff and clean/comfortable room.  The only issue we had was the heat| but I think that's a NYC thing| not specific to Millenium.  Everywhere you go| it's 80+ degrees inside with the heat blasting.  We actually left our windows open at night (38 degrees) to cool off a bit.,Nov 22| 2019,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
I've stayed at this hotel plenty of times and it's always my go to when traveling to New York. I love that it's literally in the middle of Times Square and close to everything. If you need a good workout the gym is almost always empty and has a nice clean bathroom/shower which is always super important. The staff is always helpful| friendly and accommodating. I always recommend this hotel to any of my friends and family members. Also the views are unmatched if you choose the Times Square view and request a high floor prior to arriving. I love everything about this hotel.,Nov 22| 2019,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Fantastic location... staff at check-in and the lady at the concierge desk where all amazing.,Nov 22| 2019,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
I never stayed at hotel so dirty like this one. Rooms are yucky. Carpets are horribly dirty and windowsills and chair also dirty. Bed linens seemed clean| at least for God’s sake. Depending on the hours of the day| elevators were extremely crowded and you would take forever to get in them. People were using the stairs. There is no room service it seems. The only positive thing about this hotel is its location. For those who want to stay in Times Square| it is steps distance to everything. Other than that| I don’t see anything else positive about this hotel. It is very yucky.,Nov 21| 2019,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
I loved the service and the staff were very friendly. The hotel lobby is really nice and the room was clean| I read the reviews and decided to give it a tried since they were not so good. I was not disappointed at all. Ok so the room needed a little touch up here and there but nothing to the point i wanted to run out the bed was really comfortable. I will definitely stay here again!,Nov 21| 2019,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Perfect location. Close to Times Square| Grand Central| Macy’s| Rockefeller etc. Staff were amazingly kind| helpful and very friendly. Rooms a little outdated but totally fine for our needs.

They messed up my bill majorly. They were no help at all with where to park my vehicle. The time to check in and out was ridiculous. The room was way too hot and the heat wouldn’t shut off. The water in the tub wouldn’t drain,Nov 20| 2019,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The location of this hotel is ideal| which is why it was very disappointing of how outdated it was.

The windows are so dirty you barely can see out of them.. the staff at check in was nice| however the staff and check out was horrible i asked him to explain the extras charges at check out of an urban destination fee which i was not aware of. They did not explain it to me only said i was being charge for a shuttle service i was not aware of or ever saw.

This hotel needs a deep cleaning. The deodorizer overpowered the room. We felt like we were breathing in a can of febreze. The carpets in our room were dirty. There were literally dark spots everywhere and a sticky spot near the bed. The furniture had scratches and the hinge on  cabinet under tv was broken. The bathroom is just gross. Black in the grout and cracks in tile. When we checked in we had 2 bath & hand towels and no washcloths. Housekeeping quickly delivered washcloths and more towels. The bed was fairly comfortable.

Richard at the theater desk was really helpful.  The man who brought up my bags was sweet.

So| that was not an accurate description of the view. And| I wish that the room had a refrigerator; in fact| it had an empty cabinet that looked like it may have once had a refrigerator in it. And| the safe didn't work. And| they really need to install lamps with outlets in them on the nightstand. I couldn't use my phone while in bed because it had to be plugged in across the room.

We were a girls trip| 4 sharing a room with 2x double beds. Room was fine| beds comfortable| didn’t notice any noise. Lifts were all fast (last visit very slow and waiting along time). Bathroom in room - needs a little more cleaning around sink area. Towels were changed daily. Staff all very helpful,Oct 15| 2019,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Here’s the good thing: if you are there for the theaters| it’s a really nice location. The concierge and the doorman are nice. Front desk is ok.Here are the bad things:1. Small room and old facility. Old is fine but closet door and fall off by itself| a hole or strange stain on the bed linen then probably not just old but management issue. Not all New York hotels have small rooms within that price range2. It’s too noisy. Times Square is already a sleepless location but you will be able to know what your neighbor is doing3.

First it came with a 4 star rating which was misleading. The location is perfect because of Times Square and near theater district. Hotel gave guests $10 discount for garage parking. Those were the plus for the Millennium Hotel. My room was just ok. I was expecting a refrigerator and or microwave but had neither. The mattress was uncomfortable and the room needed more lighting. Though the room was tidy it could use some updating ( the furniture looked old). The bathroom was nice but the bathroom counter could've been cleaned a little better.

Pro:  The property was located in the middle of Time Square.The staff| except for the man at the concierge| was very helpful.  The entrance to the Millenium was very nice. Check in was easy with courteous people.Con:  The rooms needs to be refurbished. Musty smell| carpet tearing| missing items such as clock radio| luggage rack| lamp was not working.  Called for a refrigerator| was put on a waiting list| never got it|  I have never been to a hotel without a refrigerator.  Ice machine down the hall was broken.,Sep 23| 2019,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
the rooms more distributed| no refrigerator.  It makes a lot of noise inside the room in the air conditioner.  poor lighting and the lamps were still broken.  bad experience,Sep 23| 2019,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Let's start with what this hotel is:Convenient and cheap (relatively). Most people would balk at the thought of staying in Times Square but we had an event nearby so had to be here. Hopefully| you are not spending a huge amount of time in your room if you are in NYC and if that's you| this place is perfect. It's somewhere to lay your head and have a change of clothes. I will say| for being in Times Square| it also is pretty quiet and dark if you use the black out curtains.What is is not:Particularly well-maintained or clean.

Pro:  The property was located in the middle of Time Square.The staff| except for the man at the concierge| was very helpful.  The entrance to the Millenium was very nice. Check in was easy with courteous people.Con:  The rooms needs to be refurbished. Musty smell| carpet tearing| missing items such as clock radio| luggage rack| lamp was not working.  Called for a refrigerator| was put on a waiting list| never got it|  I have never been to a hotel without a refrigerator.  Ice machine down the hall was broken.,Sep 23| 2019,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
the rooms more distributed| no refrigerator.  It makes a lot of noise inside the room in the air conditioner.  poor lighting and the lamps were still broken.  bad experience,Sep 23| 2019,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Let's start with what this hotel is:Convenient and cheap (relatively). Most people would balk at the thought of staying in Times Square but we had an event nearby so had to be here. Hopefully| you are not spending a huge amount of time in your room if you are in NYC and if that's you| this place is perfect. It's somewhere to lay your head and have a change of clothes.

The staff was very friendly and helpful| the location was easy to navigate. The room however was not very clean. Dirty carpets and you could tell the bathroom floor wasn't very clean. The bed was quite hard and terrible flat pillows. The worst thing though| was the fact that they had no coffee in the room| nor did they have complimentary coffee anywhere in the hotel. Granted| there is Starbucks next door| but if you're wanting just a cup of black coffee when you get out of bed| you're out of luck! No microwave| just the very miminimum of anything complimentary.  Wouldn't stay here again. Decent price in comparison to other hotels nearby but just not worth it.  I have never ever stayed in a hotel that doesn't have coffee.

I did not  like that my room did not automatically include a mini fridge inside it.  In addition I assumed the mattresses in the room would be softer,Aug 24| 2019,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Excellent location to go to Times Square. I didn’t like the service at the check in. People aren’t prepared to explain anything. The room was dirty the carpet smells really bad for the price I paid I was thinking about something really nice and elegant. Very disappointed. I choose these hotels because I saw pictures but very different pictures. I give 2 stars,Aug 20| 2019,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

My stay here was okay; convenient. My issues were: cheap and paper thin sheets| definitely not enough outlets in the room| couldn’t change the temperature on the thermostat so it was either keep it at 65 degrees or turn it off| and the water pressure in the shower was quite ridiculous- way too powerful.,Aug 20| 2019,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Our room wasn't clean.   There was no fridge or microwave| or coffee maker.  Bathroom sink had cracks in it.   On our last day at your hotel we waited and waited and waited to take an elevator down from our 28th floor| and finally after 20 minutes| we took the stairs because we had a reservation to be at.  (I am in my 70's| my daughter and my two granddaughters 17 & 13).  Was a bad experience.  I would not recommend your hotel to my friends or family.  We found it unfriendly.  Thats my review.

Our bathroom ceiling was stained and peeling. Also the door would not close without alot of effort. 2 people from engineering came to see the problem door| 1 on Tuesday saying it would be fixed on Wednesday - it wasn't. The 2nd came on Wednesday when I called again and he fixed it partially. He also told me someone would come on Thursday as long as I contacted the front desk on my way out which I did but it still wasn't fixed when we returned to our room after the Yankees game that evening.,Aug 17| 2019,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The millennium is right at Times Square which is convenient. The staff was friendly.  The ratings i read gave it a four star| however there was nothing fancy about it. It was small with two queen beds.  The bathroom had some black stains in the shower.

The hotel is centrally located and close to all that Times Square has to offer. Check in and check out was easy and handled professionally. We went to breakfast one time and were charged $57.00 for microwaved sausage and scrambled eggs. We made that mistake only once. The rooms are very dated and the windows overlooking the skyline were filthy.

The staff and employees were all so kind and accommodating| The housekeepers were amazing and sweet and the absolute best!!!! The one thing I didn't like about the hotel is that was no water fountain station to fill up my water bottle before heading out or coming back to the room for the night.

This hotel was in a good location and the staff was nice. The only problem with the room was the drain was broken so we couldn't take a bath| but we preferred showers anyway. So why did it get a low score from me? Because there customer service thereafter is terrible. They took $50 a night for a security deposit. Okay reasonable. After we checked out they kept $114 of it. I tried to call the hotel| they keep telling me to get in contact with accounting. They forward me to them| I left a message the first 2 times| and the last 2 my call won't even go through to accounting. So I tried to call the US Corporate Office that they have listed on their website. Neither of those work. As long as you expect to pay a security deposit and not get it all back| then by all means stay at this hotel| just know what you are getting into beforehand,Aug 7| 2019,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The hotel was nice.  It's in a great location. That being said| our room was NOTHING like the picture online and what I thought I was paying for.  Also| there are five elevators for the entire hotel and only 3 were working.  Then on our third day only ONE elevator was working!  We missed our tour that morning and didn't get to see Ellis Island or Yankee Stadium.  We had to practically run down 30 flights of steps and still missed the bus.Thankfully they refunded the **$150 hold on my CC** they require when checking in- going towards "fees."  Really unnecessary.  Plus one of the guys at the desk was a total dick every day.,Jul 23| 2019,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

We arrived and had to wait until 4:00 to check in. They did take our bags and store them| but gave us a key to the lobby washroom to freshen up and then sent us away. We certainly entertained ourselves at the Sunday Market on Broadway ... but still. Washing up after a long flight in the hotel bathroom with only two stalls and a bunch of other women trying to do the same kind of soured our idea of this place.,Jul 22| 2019,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

What a fabulous hotel| and the people who staff it are second to none. I can't say enough about Ruben Gonzalez at the front desk. He seemed to do all he could to make our stay delightful and he educated us on everything from how to avoid traffic to where to shop to how great Manhattan tap water is!

I would have liked to have something written paper in the room to advise me as to what amenities were available versus having it on the TV.

Loved the location but that's about all there is to love.  This hotel is in desperate need of a makeover.  Sooooo disappointing.  The bathroom tub and tiled walls need to be resurfaced.  The furniture and curtains need to be trashed.  The website list room amenities BUT. THERE. ARE NONE...no coffee maker| no microwave| no refrigerator...luckily we didn't spend a lot of time in the room.  The elevators SUCKED and that's when they actually worked!  Had to walk down 30 flights of stairs to go to breakfast one morning. Thank God we were able to catch one going back up!  To add insult to injury| they have the NERVE to charge a "Resort Fee" which is laughable.  I guess they consider climbing and going down 30 flights of stairs a designer fitness gym!!?? But I will say this... the photographer they hired to take room photos is truly gifted.,Jul 13| 2019,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Very clean I had a large room. I did not receive the upgrade or higher floor I was promised however after informing the hotel regarding this I received a personal message from Mr Bryan Joseph Front Office Manager who assisted me and ensured that the remaining time in the Millennium Broadway Hotel was exceptional with this i had a wonderful time.

Over all the property was great and in a great location to everything on Times Square.  When we first arrived and was given a room| our room had not been cleaned. Bed was left as if someone had just gotten out of it| bathroom had towels in the floor| and the room in general was in shambles.  We were given a new room and it was clean.  Out of the 4 days we were there| two elevators were not running| or had problems.  This made it extremely difficult to get to our destinations.  We purposely got up an our earlier on our departure date to make sure we could get down the elevators.  Which then had us at the airport 3 hours before our flight.  It would be hard for me to recommend your hotel.  I also felt like the concierge was very rude| he didn't seem to want to be bothered.  Your front desk people were great| and your door men| were always polite. I guess| I just expected more from your hotel.  Plus| I didn't like that you charged me extra per day to stay.  You all made up for the day| that you said I was getting free for booking online through Expedia.

The elevator fiasco that we experienced was horrible. There were only 2 elevators working and the waits were upwards to 30 minutes or more. They didn't even bother to help address the situation. We were travelling with my 3 year old daughter and with her stroller. From flight 30 we had to go all the way down on the stairs. And the checkout informed us that we can leave our bags at the hotel the last day. They inform us to talk to a certain employee. As I went up to him| he shrugged me off and said leave the bags by the door while he walked away. Later| he would then try to scold us saying never to do that and then lied when I told him I was following his instructions.,Jul 8| 2019,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Location was great but for a hotel with 40 plus floors to have only 2 elevators working on a busy weekend was unacceptable. The front desk may no attempt to pacify very angry guest who waited an hour to get down from high floors...,Jul 9| 2019,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Elevators were slow and packed. No fridge in the room. No clock radio in the room. No coffee machine in the room. Mattress was hard and uncomfortable and pillows were flat. Glasses in the bathroom were not wrapped in the sanitary plastic.,Jul 9| 2019,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The elevator fiasco that we experienced was horrible. There were only 2 elevators working and the waits were upwards to 30 minutes or more. They didn't even bother to help address the situation. We were travelling with my 3 year old daughter and with her stroller. From flight 30 we had to go all the way down on the stairs. And the checkout informed us that we can leave our bags at the hotel the last day. They inform us to talk to a certain employee. As I went up to him| he shrugged me off and said leave the bags by the door while he walked away. Later| he would then try to scold us saying never to do that and then lied when I told him I was following his instructions.,Jul 8| 2019,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Location was excellent. Doormen and concierge staff were very helpful. There are no basic amenities that most hotels would have (coffee maker| water in lounge| ...). Service charge per day seems excessive when there really are zero extra services. Cot per day is an extra $50 ($49.00) - double what most hotels charge. They added an extra $60 onto the standard $250 credit card hold stating that the cot in the room brought up the “value” of the room. Watch all the “extra” charges or pending on your credit card.

The staff was very nice and helpful.  Hotel room was very clean.  However| the hotel is extremely outdated| the furniture in the room was very old.  The bathtub drain did not have the stop| there was a hole.  The water took forever to drain.  The bathtub floor (were you stand)| was peeling| toilet was old.  The worse thing was the beds.  They were so hard| you literally bounced| and the pillow were flat| hard and overused.  I found out when I complained| that the beds had been changed on the 40th floor.  I have a feeling they save the best rooms for direct clients| not third party guests like Expedia| Hotels.com| etc.  we moved to another hotel in Midtown.,Jul 3| 2019,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

I liked the location of the hotel. It was very close to Everything just steps away from Times Square and all the broadways shows.  Check in was pleasant| we arrived earlier in the morning and our room wasn’t ready because check in is at 4pm. We left our luggage at the bell desk and left for the day. When we returned our room was ready and were given keys. We went up to our room and everything seemed good but when I walked into the bathroom I noticed the bath tub was dirty. The first night was good other than trying to avoid stepping in the arrea where  the Bathtub was dirty. When we returned to our room in the evening on our second day we noticed our room had been cleaned but again the bathtub was NOT. The next day we left early morning we were out by 6:30 am. and returned late at night 11pm| to our surprise our room was never cleaned. I called the front desk and was transferred to a manager and he said they didn’t have anyone to clean it at that time. I told him I really didn’t want it to be cleaned at that time but I did need clean towels. He said he would send them right up. After more than an hour of waiting past midnight. No one came I called back again and after about 30 min someone brought me clean towels. When I opened the door the hotel employee didn’t say a word just handed me the towels I said thank you and he just walked away without saying a single word. I wasn’t to pleased with the customer service at this hotel. I will not be returning to this hotel.,Jun 30| 2019,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

At check in I was told that I hadn’t covered my room charges| which I disputed having already paid online on Expedia. I was forced to pay thousands of dollars AGAIN. When I presented my bank statements less than 30 minutes later and asked for this second charge to be reversed| I was told it was impossible and that I would have to either email management or have my bank reverse the transaction. This was all completely unnecessary and should have absolutely been compensated for in some way. While on vacation in New York| I was out double my hotel charge for the week.

It's not a 4 star hotel compared to other 4 star hotels.  There's no refrigerator or coffee maker. I like the location though.  It's close to time square  & bed is comfortable.,Jun 22| 2019,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
This is our 4th time to visit the property and the first time we were disappointed. The staff was easily overwhelmed at check in| the concierge desk signed us up for the wrong dates for car service that we had to fix and no bill was put under our door on the morning of checkout. When we went to the front desk to get a copy| they took quite some time and didn’t seem concerned. Like I said| we have stayed there multiple times with great experiences but the staff seemed to be new and unaware of what to do.,Jun 22| 2019,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

At check in I was told that I hadn’t covered my room charges| which I disputed having already paid online on Expedia. I was forced to pay thousands of dollars AGAIN. When I presented my bank statements less than 30 minutes later and asked for this second charge to be reversed| I was told it was impossible and that I would have to either email management or have my bank reverse the transaction. This was all completely unnecessary and should have absolutely been compensated for in some way. While on vacation in New York| I was out double my hotel charge for the week. Unacceptable.,Jun 22| 2019,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The Millenium| which we have gone for many years| has decreased their amenities. No room service| no coffee pot in room.  It has become just a room with small pillows and a bed that is not at all comfortable. The price paid was too high for just a below average room,Jun 14| 2019,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

They charged me $145 for "extra taxes" which is ok but I paid it when I check out and then they charged my card for another $145 and now I have to try to dispute it.

I was hoping the bad reviews weren’t true and just maybe people were being too picky. However...even the remarks about the FLAT worn out pillows and the stopper for the tub were true!  No microwave| no refrigerator and no coffee maker. I asked for a fridge and was told it was ordered. It never showed up.  Thankfully| I brought our single Keurig along. The room was clean and the bathroom was exceptionally clean.  So points for that. It’s listed as a 4 star hotel| but I don’t think it reaches that status. Good location| nice restaurant.  Definitely dated rooms that could use some sprucing up.,Jun 6| 2019,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Amazing location| literally 100m from times square & slap bang in the middle of Broadway. Bars & restaurants & theatres outside both doors (front 45th st & back 44th st). Virgils BBQ restaurant outside 45th St entrance is well worth a visit. Hotel room just ok though| no shower gel provided & be aware of $28 per night service charge on arrival. I wasn't !,Jun 1| 2019,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Liked the locationDidn't like lack of tea/coffee making facility in room,May 31| 2019,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
No coffeemakers in the room and they won’t allow you to take coffee from their restaurant to your room.  So you have to go across the street.  For a morning coffee drinker who likes to linger and drink coffee while getting ready this is a real draw back.  I will not stay here again,May 31| 2019,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Don’t stay at this hotel! Regardless if they’re upgrading| it doesn’t have the amenities an average person needs: USB ports| extra outlets| small coffee pot and a working a/c unit. With four in a larger room| this hotel only had 2 outlets. Not enough!,Jun 1| 2019,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The hotel location was good| right in the middle of Times Square. Walking distance to most area attractions. The hotel did not clean our room throughly prior to check in.  There were skittles (candy) on the floor beside the bed and an empty shampoo bottle behind the bathroom door.,May 28| 2019,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The Millennium Times Square is very conveniently located| it is in the heart of Times Square and within easy walking distance of many sites.  The rooms are nice| comfortable and clean.  I would have liked a coffee maker and refrigerator in the room| but those were the only items that I really missed during my stay.,May 28| 2019,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
It has a great location but the rooms can be updated.  Lamps outdated without charging ports.  The beds weren’t that comfortable| the blankets were very thin. The bathtub tiles were dirty.  The bathroom didn’t have extractor. Simple Things that can be updated for the price that the people pay for the hotel.,May 28| 2019,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The property was in a good location in Times Square and the room was clean. That's about the only thing good about this place.The bed was hard as a rock and the pillows were flat. If we were staying there for more than two nights| we would have had to change hotels because of the lousy bed and pillows - not conducive to sleeping at all. Also| they give you an ice bucket but no cups (paper or otherwise). We had to buy a bottle of water in order to be able to take medication or to have something to drink! Also| no coffee maker and no place convenient to get a cup of coffee. Check in was ridiculous. The person at the desk was nice| but he was the ONLY person working behind the desk.. We checked in close to 9 pm which ordinarily wouldn't be a busy time| but the people in front of us had some kind of issue with the room that the person behind the desk was trying to resolve. We stood there for about 20 minutes waiting to get checked in at a time that should have ordinarily taken about 5 minutes.,May 26| 2019,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Overall this hotel is below average. I rated 2.5 star| not 4| especially the room. Even with the upgrade after I compliant about the room. Still not good enough. The bathroom need a major upgrade and update. The bed sheet and comforter is old. The towels is old. Furniture is broken. Lights not working. Room is dirty. No refrigerator in the room. No coffee in the first room. And they didn’t refuse the coffee on the second room. I try to book the shuttle for my son to the airport. He told me he just about to close| and tell us go to the next hotel and book it there. That means he not close. He just too lazy to do it.  I couldn’t believe I pay close to $400 a day for this. And other charges when I check out. Never stay here again. Such a bad experience. VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED. Last two times I came to New York. I pay about the same price |I got a much better room in the same area. I’m going back to intercontinental. The room is perfect.,May 21| 2019,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The location is perfect. The gentlemen at the door are very friendly & very helpful. The housekeeping is excellent. We arrived May 13th | around 8-9 pm| the check in was really quick the lady at the desk gave us instructions where to go and which elevator to take. There’s a desk near the elevators that has a sign “theatre desk”. There are 2 guys in there| as we are walking to the elevators they did not shout but with really loud voice complete with pointing of both their arms to use the elevators on the other end. My point was I didn’t appreciate the way they talked to us|as if we don’t speak English.By the way I’m Asian| I have an accent| but I speak English very well. It’s late and raining we’re hungry so I didn’t say anything to them| I’ll give them the benefit of the doubt that they have been telling people to use the correct elevators all day long.The room could use a coffe naker.

We had a great room with a great view of Times Square (1609) and the Ball & Clock Tower| room 1609. Everything about our stay there was fantastic from the check-in to the doormen & concierge and check-out| all the staff were fantastic. Only drawback is I wish there was a coffee maker in the room. We loved out stay there & would love to return again someday! Thank you Millennium Hotel for a fantastic visit!,May 14| 2019,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Loved the location!  Easy access to subways and a block off Times Square. The bad - the rooms are in desparate need of updating (ripped carpet|  not very clean). The beds were hard| like sleeping on piece of plywood! The good - plenty of hot water for showers| did not hear any outside noise| and the cconcierge desk was wonderful!,May 14| 2019,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

We had a great room with a great view of Times Square (1609) and the Ball & Clock Tower| room 1609. Everything about our stay there was fantastic from the check-in to the doormen & concierge and check-out| all the staff were fantastic. Only drawback is I wish there was a coffee maker in the room. We loved out stay there & would love to return again someday! Thank you Millennium Hotel for a fantastic visit!,May 14| 2019,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

This hotel was in an ideal spot but the deco is very tired and very badly scratched  with a cupboard door hanging off!Although clean overall there were certain areas around the toilet and skirtings that would have needed to be attended to.

The location was great| a block away from Time Square. The room we got was not like the pics. We ended up in an older part I guess. The bed was extra firm. They also charge a $25 daily fee| that supposed to cover that there's a fitness and business center| but that's standard in any hotel| so watch the pricing. I felt it's a way for them to show a lesser price on line and then actually charge you more later. Overall| not bad| but will probably find a different one next trip.,May 7| 2019,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

This hotel is definitely my favorite go to in NYC.. the location is perfect. The staff is amazing the view was the best.. eish this is where I would have been last yr. When I was here for NYE.

Everything was perfect. Perfect location (right in the heart of Time Square)| fast check-in| clean room with great view and nice staff. We thought we were having an issue with the heat| we called the front desk and they sent someone in less than a min. It turned out we werent working the thermostat property. They also approved us for a late check-out (12pm) My husband and I came there for one night snd spent the day touring the city. The only reason I didnt give 5 stars bc theres no parking but they do provide discounted parking passes to a parking lot about 3 blocks away ($40/car for 24hrs - no in/out).

A/c did not work or so I was told. Each day I asked front desk rep why a/c wasn’t working and each day I was given a different reason. One reason was the a/c was broken another reason BY LAW the hotel had to turn off the A/C. Was told to simply open the windows. Although the temperature was cold outside I would have still like the option to control the temperature inside the room. I am from Florida and sleeping in hot room regardless of location was uncomfortable.Only  a $50 refund was credit back to me as a courtesy due to the inconvenience....only $50.,Apr 25| 2019,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The elevators had significant wait times. I waited close to 20 minutes for an elevator causing me to be late to a meeting.,Apr 24| 2019,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
At check in we weren’t told about the “resort fee” of $29 per night which means we get to use the hotel’s facilities despite already paying the room rate! The lifts are terrible-expect to wait about 20 minutes to leave the hotel. The communal areas and rooms are a bit tired and needs a refresh.,Apr 21| 2019,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
I booked a superior room and it was not available. I only got refunded $28 for two of our three nights I was told we had option of moving to better room for next 2 nights but as only on 3 night stay I did not want to repack and move  as we planned to sightsee all day,Apr 20| 2019,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

I stayed at the Millennium Times square hotel for 2 days 4/9 - 4/10 2019 first night was fine. The second night I didn't notice I didn't have a comforter until I went to lay down after 11pm I called down stairs a few times| an 1hr. later went down to the front desk.  About 1/2 hr. later I received a very thin blanket| I was done for the night!  In the morning I brought this up and asked to speak to a manager| this became the first problem.  This escalted and escalated further an further (because they treated me so poorly and as if I were ignorant) I was treated very rudely and told I was trying to get something or free.  I was not on vacation I was there for work.  I'm trying to keep this short in hopes it will reach someone who is willing to read it and cares.  Long story short! Then they came to the point of threatening me with calling the police. Oh yeah| I'm a 6'4'' 300lb. Black man!  I told them to go ahead and call the police if they wish I was not finished conducting my business here at the hotel and not leaving until I was.  The police came and were very nice and understanding and didn't want to arrest me but had to side with the hotel if they said I had to leave now!  All of this over a comforter....  By the way I'm one of the owners of the newest Marriott Autograph hotel- the Historic Cavalier Hotel in Virginia Beach Va. and Embassy suites and Marriott Vacation properties under construction on the ocean front. I've never written anything like this before.,Apr 19| 2019,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
could not get extra pillows and blankets despite several calls to housekeeping.  No coffee in the room and we were told to park in the wrong garage.,Apr 18| 2019,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Location was the only great value of this hotel. The rooms are old and out dated. The staff are not friendly or helpful. My initial room was dirty and noisy so they changed my room which helped. I was promised free water bottles and extra toiletries and I never received them. I didn’t bother chase them. I did get two free breakfast vouchers but overall I won’t be returning to this hotel in the future. The pictures on your web site of the rooms are INCORRECT.

The hotel is well located. There is no coffee pot in the room| no refrigerator and the pillows and blankets were very uncomfortable. The blankets were thin and poor quality.

Great location but that’s about it.  No AC| no refrigerator in room.  After 3 requests we did get a tiny fridge.  Bed was hard and room was hot.  Elevators were slow and you need to build in 15 minutes to get down to the lobby.  Terrible view of tops of buildings next door from our room at least.,Mar 24| 2019,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Good thing about property it’s close to everything near Broadway and Times Square. What I didn’t like:  When they standard room they mean Standard!  Hardest bed ever! If your hot natured you can’t turn the heat down just off...and open a window is your choice. No coffee maker you have to ask for it. No fridge| no pens| paper| no menu| no info about the hotel services in room...nothing special. Like a no name hotel in the middle of no where.  Breakfast is better at Hard Rock for price and what you get. I don’t know what the premier rooms are like but I hope they are 10xs better!,Mar 1| 2019,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

There was bugs in our bathroom. When we asked to move as this was unacceptable to us they had oversold the rooms and had no rooms available that they could move us to. They would not help us find or secure another hotel for the night. We spent an hour and half talking to the front desk and phoning all over the city on our own to try and find another room but there was nothing we could find for a Saturday night. They would not help us find another room or pay the difference for a room with now short notice so all the prices were higher. Our male friends said they would switch rooms with us for the night until we could secure a room somewhere else the next night. We had to move all our own lugggage between the rooms. Then we asked that they put on clean sheets for us due to the switch. We came back in the late evening/early morning to find a bag of sheets on the floor outside of our room!!!!!!!! They once again said they have no maids. All of the staff there were completely unsympathetic and beyond frustrating to deal with. I was told that we would be credited for the two nights and I still have not seen a credit to my account from nearly a week and a half ago. I would not recommend this hotel service to anyone!!! Worst experience ever and I have stayed in my share of hotels.,Feb 28| 2019,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

If your hot natured you can’t turn the heat down just off...and open a window is your choice. No coffee maker you have to ask for it. No fridge| no pens| paper| no menu| no info about the hotel services in room...nothing special. Like a no name hotel in the middle of no where.  Breakfast is better at Hard Rock for price and what you get. I don’t know what the premier rooms are like but I hope they are 10xs better!,Mar 1| 2019,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The hotel is a shadow of itself.  Horrible.  I stayed at this hotel 5 years ago.  It was perfect.  There’s now a nail in the bed head.,Mar 1| 2019,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

There was bugs in our bathroom. When we asked to move as this was unacceptable to us they had oversold the rooms and had no rooms available that they could move us to. They would not help us find or secure another hotel for the night. We spent an hour and half talking to the front desk and phoning all over the city on our own to try and find another room but there was nothing we could find for a Saturday night. They would not help us find another room or pay the difference for a room with now short notice so all the prices were higher. Our male friends said they would switch rooms with us for the night until we could secure a room somewhere else the next night. We had to move all our own lugggage between the rooms. Then we asked that they put on clean sheets for us due to the switch. We came back in the late evening/early morning to find a bag of sheets on the floor outside of our room!!!!!!!! They once again said they have no maids. All of the staff there were completely unsympathetic and beyond frustrating to deal with. I was told that we would be credited for the two nights and I still have not seen a credit to my account from nearly a week and a half ago. I would not recommend this hotel service to anyone!!! Worst experience ever and I have stayed in my share of hotels.,Feb 28| 2019,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Convenient location - in the middle of everything.  Close to the theaters.  Didn't feel clean and the bed spreads were paper thin so I was freezing all night even with the heat cranked.  The bed was hard and uncomfortable.,Feb 25| 2019,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The staff are overly friendly and hospitable. Everything was great. The only thing I wished I had was a coffee maker in the room but there is a Starbucks right outside of the 5th street entrance which ended up being fine.

The property location is perfect. The Times Square view was very nice. The hotel is a little old. The phone buttons didn’t work. I had to always hit 0. The thermostat was pretty strange. There’s only heat so I had to crack a window open. It was the first time I’ve been cold and hot at the same time. What I didn’t like was the bed. Very uncomfortable mattress. Gave me a shoulder and back ache. Surprised that a hotel would have that bad of a mattress.

really disappointed with the poor service and response to my complaint| I didn't get the room that I had booked and paid  for| rooms were still not ready 2 hours after check in time| very poor response from the staff to my complaint. I have called and emailed several time since| got no response. I would not stay here again. The hotel told me that Hotels/com make up the info on the rooms that don't exist.,Feb 3| 2019,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

This property is centrally located in Times Square just by the ABC Studios.  Great location for walking.  Super restaurants right across from the hotel.  The hotel is tired and dated.  Could use a reno to update the rooms.  Clean and staff friendly and very helpful.,Jan 29| 2019,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
The hotel is in a great location. So easy to get places and surrounded by some great restaurants. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. My only disappointment was it rates its self as a four star hotel| but the amenities in the room are definitely only 2 or 3 star standards.,Jan 29| 2019,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Went to NYC with my daughter for her birthday. Had a wonderful time. Location was great| and staff were pleasant.Wished I had coffee maker and small fridge. (Did get a call from manager to appease| but I was leaving the next day and didn’t want to bother)I had also requested a high floor with good view| but was told that’s the “type” of room I paid for. Made it seem like I couldn’t even upgrade.Will be going back to NYC with family and friends| but I think I will call the hotel manager directly and request these things over the phone prior to my trip.,Jan 29| 2019,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

It was an amazing experience. Even though it was for just one night we could see the excellence of this hotel. The location was amazing| just a short walk from Times Square| the room was very clean and organized| the shower was really nice| the view is amazing| Mr. Syed from the reception was very kind and gave us an amazing first impression| the other receptionist was very very kind| too bad I didn’t get her name and the luggage men were very kind too!

The only positive to this hotel is the location. We picked this hotel based on it being a 4 star - it's not. It's in bad need of a renovation| it's tired| there obviously used to be a mini bar/fridge but they decided to rip it out. We were provided with an ice bucket and a kettle| but no glasses| cups or coffee/tea making facilities. Our bed sheets had holes in them| the windows were filthy| and the light bulbs had layers of dust on them. Not a hotel that I can recommend I'm afraid and I would advise anyone thinking of booking to look elsewhere.,Jan 21| 2019,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
One area of note - prepare to wait on the elevators — they were very difficult if you were staying on a higher level floor| trying to catch one many times waited 10+ minutes| or had to take stairs from 42nd floor.,Jan 21| 2019,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

My fiance did a night in the city to take in a show. The staff was very friendly. I had called earlier and they accommodated my early check in as well as my request for a city view on a higher floor. The room was very clean and comfortable. You could see there was some wear though in terms of the curtain rods| the fan getting stuck in the bathroom| cracks in the bathroom floor. None of these things affected my stay but they were aesthetically displeasing and they are pretty simple fixes.

Check in was smooth however the resort fee (for 3 nights - $80) seemed like a last minute cash grab by the hotel although all the hotels in Times Square had this fee it made no sense.The hotel is dated. we were in room 3003 on the 30th floor and our view of Times Square wasn't the best. Location was great we were in walking distance of everything. The restaurant in the hotel was Singaporean so not really even on our radar. Beware.. the gift shop in the lobby overcharges. There is a Walgreens 2 minutes awayThe room was sub-par. In the restroom above the toilet there were brown spots and pubic hairs. They only give 2 hand towels and a bunch of other towels also. The tile and tube need a GOOD cleaning.The mattress was HARD and the comforter was paper thin. I had to ask for 2 extra comforters. The headboard was missing emblems and the furniture was very worn and scuffed.I believe there are several things they could improve upon but they should be realistic about the views and the quality of the rooms. I was disappointed in my choice but the location made up for it.

The hotel was centrally located| which was nice. The elevators are so noisy we could not sleep. All night all we heard we’re the elevators,Jan 7| 2019,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Stay was great| people were really nice and accommodating but bathroom was a little dated with some rust on the faucet etc.  Also| the curtain didn't open all of the way to reveal the NY skyline we were looking for.  Overall though a great experience..,Jan 7| 2019,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The location was perfect. Walking distance to everything iconic in NYC. We went to see a broadway play and only walked 2 blocks from hotel. Rockefeller plaza only a 10 minute walk. For the price you can’t beat this hotel. Spacious rooms but could use a little updating. We will stay here again.,Jan 7| 2019,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
great location|| if you want to be in the heart of broadway.. and a good price here you go,Jan 7| 2019,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The beds were super hard| rooms were terribly small| nothing like the pictures! The ac couldn’t be turned on so we had to sleep with the window open because it was soo hot! Service may have been bad because it was New Years weekend but we asked for towels| blankets| and pillows numerous times and NEVER got them. We actually stopped a housekeeper on the hall just to take our own towels. Rooms were old looking and bathrooms were rusty and showed signs of age. The location was perfect for why we went but I won’t stay here again. For the money I spent it should have atleast been a nicer room!,Jan 5| 2019,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Great location. Can’t beat it. Only issue: No ability to put air on in room was slightly uncomfortable. opened window to air out. Would get stale and stuffy especially bathroom with no fan.,Jan 4| 2019,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Stayed over New Years. Staff were very accommodating| room was clean   Had a great time,Jan 3| 2019,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Very noisy location. Staff fairly unfriendly. Breakfast is two-tiered system If rate included is not as good as paying on day from a menu. Lifts very noisy if your room is next to the lift shaft which ours was| for SEVEN nights.,Jan 2| 2019,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Great location with fabulous and welcoming staff. The concierge and security staff were top notch. Our bathroom was full of mold. Black mold. Our room had popcorn in the corner and under the side of the bed all 6 nights we stayed there. Biggest complaint was it was too hot! We cracked the windows| but the room remained extremely hot. Couldn’t stay there again.,Jan 2| 2019,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Great location and the porters/bellmen were very friendly.Housekeeping promptly delivered an extra bath towel upon request.There was no refrigerator in the room.  Not sure if this is the same with all of the rooms or just the standard double 'queen' bed rooms.The beds were certainly not queen sized| so it was a tight fit for a family of 4 (2 adults| kids ages 11 + 9) in the two beds.The bathroom showed signs of wear/age| but water pressure in the shower was excellent.  The room was very warm even with the heat turned off.  This was especially noticeable when trying to fall asleep.  As my stay was in December there was no chance of turning on the AC to cool the room down.,Dec 31| 2018,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Hotel is in a great location for tourists. Room was a bit tired and in need of redecoration and our room was above a generator so pretty noisy day and night.Room very clean and cleaner always made sure we had ample clean towels and toiletries even on Christmas Day. We weren’t aware we had to pay a facility tax which added another $145 US to our bill at check out. We accept this is often the way in the US and is contained in the small print. We did however find the explanation given to us by a male receptionist unprofessional when he told us the money “was for the boss” (what he literally said) which implied something less than above board. He thought this explanation was amusing which we didn’t find funny after a very expensive 5 days in NY.We much preferred the Millenium Biltmore in LA. That is a beautiful hotel.,Dec 28| 2018,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
The only thing i liked was that it was a warm place to sleep in the cold City of New York. I didnt like the 4 star hotel price I paid for what looked like a 1 or 2 star hotel.... Pictures should be attached. Dirty tubes| wallpaper peeling| small rooms! I paid for city view and got side of buildings view...just overall disappointing. Would NEVER go back!,Dec 28| 2018,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Nice older hotel. Very convenient to all Times Square sites and activities. Staff very accommodating. Because of the busy location| I would recommend a room on a higher floor to reduce the noise. Would definitely stay here again.,Dec 28| 2018,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

I loved the location. Our Bellman Kevin was outstanding| as was all the staff. The rooms were clean and ready. We checked in 1/2 hr early with no questions. The only complaint would be the heat. It’s too hot. Staying there in December the system only does heat in cold months and cool in warm months. Our window did not open so it got pretty warm in the room. That was not so fun. But let’s be honest. The room was neat and clean. The staff and food was great. How much time do you intend on spending in your room in the middle of Times Square? I was there to sleep and eat breakfast. Other than that| I never seen the place. I would definitely stay again.,Dec 23| 2018,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Millenium hotel is the best location in the city; near Bryant Park and Broadway!! We have stayed here many times| but it's been a few years...

The headboards had so much dust on them and the furniture is worn a bit.,Dec 22| 2018,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
The man at the concierge desk was wonderful with helping us with dinner plans.  The rest of the hotel had a lot to be desired.  I could never receive the proper towels. Had no wash clothes during our stay and when asked they would say they were out of them????  The sheets and bed coverings looked as if they used them to clean.  This hotel needs a desperate upgrading on furniture and amenities.  Great location is all it has.,Dec 22| 2018,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The man at the front desk was extremely rude when we checked out. I informed him that our window on the 31st floor was broken and water was leaking in from the outside of the building and that I was mad because we payed extra for a room with a view of Times Square. The window also had iced over in between the panels of glass making it impossible to see out the window. The other winless were fine except this one. I asked if there was any way to be refunded the extra money due to the inconvenience in our room and he just gave attitude and started making it seem like it was my fault and that I was in the wrong. I asked for a manager and he said no. Horrible staff extremely rude and inconsiderate.

This is in no way shape or form a 4 star hotel.  Please do not expect that!  The hotel is dirty.  Old| outdated.  Furniture is beat up like crazy and not comfortable at all. Mold in the bathroom.  Used soap bar left in the shower.  Half the staff was great| the other half was beyond rude. Even complained about this and was told we would be contacted- and we still have not been contacted.  Please stay elsewhere!,Dec 14| 2018,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Not what I expected at all. I got the time square room| which means i should be able to view time square. That wasn't the case. The room was so outdated and most of the appliances didnt work. They didnt have a coffee pot set up in my room| meanwhile I can smell it brewing in other rooms. If you are in a rush so be it Haha. Six elevators and they only run one going down. My wife and I waited nearly 22 min (no exaggeration) and almost missed our broadway show.

Hotel was nice great location| Times Square is right on the doorstep the hotel lobby was lovely and check in was timely no waiting| door men and front desk staff were polite|friendly and helpful.

On the plus-side: The rooms were pretty big for NY-Hotels. The Location of the hotel is A+. But be sure to bring enough time. Check-in took half an hour and at elevators your wait time can easily exceed 10 minutes.,Nov 25| 2018,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Great theatre desk (Maureen is a gem).  Hotel was well located| clean.  Another restaurant or coffee shop would be nice...the Asian-only option can get old after a day.,Nov 23| 2018,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Requested a disability  bathroom.  Arrived at 11:30 at night.Got undressed and did not notice regular bathroom till unpacked.  Too tired so stayed in room. Now know to check everything first.  Also| no one to carry luggage to room.,Nov 22| 2018,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
This is the fourth time I have stayed at the Millennium and each time is better than the last.  The hotel is in the heart of the theatre district and is convenient to everything.

Major problems with elevators. More than once there was only one working although there were 5 (I think) on each floor. People were walking down the stairs because they were afraid of being late for their committments. We walked down from the 42nd floor. When I mentioned it to a man at the check in counter he said there were 200 people that came in at once and were using the elevators. Clearly he was delusional if he thought I believed that! This was someone working in the evening| around 7:00| 11/15 or 16th. The elevator was also very slow or not running at all during the other days of my stay.,Nov 19| 2018,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Our room was very dirty. My mothers room had urine on the sheets when we arrived so had to have cleaned.  Bathrooms filthy and dustry corners!  The elevators - only two working the entire weekend| so had to wait up to half an hour to get downstairs.  The staff were very nice.  Greg helped us get ride to airport and took care of our bags.  Very nice staff.  Great location but terrible conditions.  Staff made up for it.,Nov 19| 2018,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

House keeping kept phoning when we had the Do Not Disturb  sign out  and one day didn't show up at all.The biggest complaint was the extra $25 plus tax per day "Facility Fee" added to the bill at checkout. Why are we paying fees for Internet and business center and recreational facilities when they are advertised as free and we didn't access most of them?

The elevators were a mess some folks including my wife and I waited for 23 minutes for the elevator to stop for us on the 45th floor.  We called security only to no one answer and the  a second time to have the security person just hang up.  Called the manager via the operator and went to his voice mail.No very customer caring at all.

Of course| the Times Square/Broadway location is wonderful| particularly since it gave us options to deal with the chaotic situation on the subways. The staff members at lobby desk| at concierge desk and for room cleaning were quick to meet our requests. The room was fine with adequate space| but I was surprised that there was no coffee pot or fridge. The elevators ran on a schedule that left people at the floors because of overcrowding. Over all| we do recommend the hotel and would stay there again.,Nov 13| 2018,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Most of staff were helpful.  Beds are incrediably hard. Asked to change rooms| all beds are supposedly the same.  Said they’d have housekeeping add something to bed to make it softer.  If they did | it didnt  make a difference   While faucet in bathroom moved each time we turned water on.

Great location great breakfast but it is very tired and old looking I was disappointed with the room it definitely needs a refurb but you can’t beat it for location.,Nov 1| 2018,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
The room was not the one we expected| the balcony had a left over stuff n it looked awful The shower was not working properly n the TV had no Channels| there was no mini fridge nor an Iron| though it had ironing board| We asked ice to be delivered in our room| it didn’t arrive Though we checked 4 hrs later| according to arrive time| Really not happy with the service,Oct 31| 2018,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
The location of shopping and time square was awesome but the hotel is outdated and dark and dull in the rooms for $500 a night it’s over priced and the curtains haven’t been washed in 3-4 years it’s dusty should be called motel-8,Oct 31| 2018,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
The location is good.  But the elevators were under repair.   We were on the 32nd floor and we waited sometimes over 15 min for an elevator.  The entire hotel needs some TLC.  Not impressed with the condition of the rooms or the lobby or the bathroom.  Won't stay there again.,Oct 30| 2018,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Didn’t need to speak to staff other than check-in| therefore it’s a neutral rating. I did pay for a superior room with a view of Times Square. My view was “very limited”| so not worth the extra cost.

The hotel rooms could do with a refresh| but the beds are comfy and the room was very clean. The food in the restaurant was good and breakfast was really tasty and set us up well for a day of exploring. The hotels best asset is it’s staff all of whom are friendly| helpful and knowledgable.

The hotel is right on broadway time square where all the night life takes place. Although it’s close to broadway you don’t get to hear the noises so you can sleep peacefully.Lots of shops| restaurants and everything you can think of. The subway is less than 5 minutes walking with great connections.All the staffs were very friendly and helpful and would highly recommend this hotel.My only issue was that we had to pay $28.69 per night for resort fee (fitness center| computer access) when checking out| which we never use. We were hardly at the hotel other than to sleep. We end up $286.90 for the 10 nights.,Oct 20| 2018,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Bucket list; Family vacation!!We felt we were mislead by photos online. Booked through Expedia and felt pushed to the "back of the line" on room location and view even though we requested it in advance and booked the trip January 2018 for an October 2018 arrival. Room had no refrigerator for water| smelled like dirty socks the whole time| had no view| we got 17th floor out of like 40 floors| which we felt was bogus. The pillows were flat. It was a great location close to everything| but there are others in that area| so I would not stay there again.,Oct 20| 2018,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Beautiful room right in Times Square. Quite spacious for Manhattan. Appreciated that the A/C was fairly quiet. Lovely experience. Needs better and more accessible outlets for phones and tablets.,Oct 9| 2018,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Clean. Efficient. Good price. Great location. Will be staying here next time. Two nights in a row they forgot to leave washcloths. Called the front desk| they sent some right up. If that’s the worst problem| I think that makes it a pretty fantastic trip. I’m really picky about cleanliness and attitude. Every staff member we interacted with was fast and friendly| and the room was very clean. Check and check.,Oct 4| 2018,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Great hotel and centrally located! I’ll definitely stay again!,Oct 2| 2018,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Many years ago we stayed at the Millennium Hotel in New York City. We were so impressed with the hotel we purchased a gift card for family who were celebrating their anniversary so they could stay. We return a few years later and again were impressed. So when we were discussing a trip back to NYC for our 5th wedding anniversary we chose a hotel we thought we could count on. Sadly we were mistaken. We arrived late Friday evening checked in and were given a room with a large water stain and black mold on the ceiling. It also had leaked onto the curtain.  There were dead bugs in the light fixture outside our room and the light fixtures in the hallway were damaged and broken.  The carpets were stained and looked dirty and we heard the slamming of doors all night long. The front desk did offer to move us| but after a very late check in and a busy schedule| I didn’t want to re-pack. I wanted a bottle of water and had to leave he hotel because there are no vending machines in the entire hotel.,Oct 2| 2018,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
,Oct 1| 2018,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
The hotel is very close to Time Square| shopping and great restaurants.  The staff at the front desk and door man were wonderful.  The conceriege booked the wrong shuttle bus for me to get to the airport| so I almost missed my flight.  Highly stressful.The room we stayed at was completely filthy.  It was disgusting!  The bedding was a sheet and a blanket with no cover.  The towels were clean.  We went for 2 days without a bathmat| hand towels or face clothes....that was disappointing.  The overall room was worn out| furniture was beat up| carpet had orange stains and was dirty.  Bathroom sink and tub were dirty with grime.  Corners had buildups of dirt| dust and grime.  Light fixtures and walls had greasy grime..super disappointed with the hotel.,Oct 1| 2018,1,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
This is a perfect location.  We were able to easily walk to plays| Central Park and great restaurants.,Oct 1| 2018,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Really pleased with the hotel| the only reason I would rate it a 4/5 overall is due to the rooms looking a little tired. Although they are spacious and we had a great view of the Times Square ball on the 35th floor.,Sep 30| 2018,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Great location| right in the middle of Times Sq. Nice room| but Bathroom could use a renovation.,Sep 30| 2018,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Excellent location| front desk staff and doormen.  The room was good and the price was competitive.  The major drawback was that the hotel shut off in-room control of the thermostat.  It rained heavily and the temperature ranged from the high 70s to mid 80s during our 3 night stay.  It was so hot and humid our windows were fogged up when we opened our curtains on the last morning.  It was extremely uncomfortable and very difficult to sleep.  We expected more from a hotel of this quality.We left a note for the housekeeper after the first night asking it be fixed and that note was picked up| but it wasn’t repaired.  We couldn’t move to another hotel due to the UN opening week and most other good hotels were full or prices were jacked up. On our check-out review to the hotel we raised this as an issue and were eventually told that since we had checked out nothing could be done for us| but they’ll look into it and hope to serve us again.  That’s not likely| and because we’re travel agents we’ll also be advising our clients.,Sep 30| 2018,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Hello|  the check in person wasn’t welcoming. But other staff like the door man| the concierge| bell boys| maids made you feel welcome.   The toilet didn’t work well.  It took 2 flushes  to get rid of dirt.   We complained  twice| and maintenance came quickly| but didn’t solve the problem so we put up with it for 4 days.  When I phoned for ice where I was instructed to do| I could never get an answer.  For $500.00 per night I was expecting a little bit of comfort.  The location is great| but I wouldn’t recommend this hotel.  There is no decent sitting area in the lobby..,Sep 30| 2018,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Door and concierge staff very knowledgeable| helpful and friendly but some front desk and restaurant staff need to be overhauled in customer service! It would have been helpful if front desk informed us of their amenities such as their restaurant and the great breakfast buffet when we checked in.

Door and concierge staff very knowledgeable| helpful and friendly but some front desk and restaurant staff need to be overhauled in customer service! It would have been helpful if front desk informed us of their amenities such as their restaurant and the great breakfast buffet when we checked in. But overall a very good hotel and I would definitely stay there again.,Sep 10| 2018,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

The carpet in the room wasn't the cleanest| but doable.  Second day our bath towels were replaced with ones that had holes in them| and only given one wash cloth for two people.

El hotel tiene una ubicación privilegiada| su personal muy servicial. La habitación estaba con el sello de limpieza por lo del COVID y eso me pareció excelente. Mi familia volveríamos a escoger el hotel nuevamente para hospedarnos para una próxima visita a New York Time square. 🗽,Jan 12| 2021,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Tanto dinero que cobran disque por resort y ni agua en la habitacion tienen tampoco nevera ni el café que comun mente dan en todo hotel en la mañana. De las made que te puedo decir con tan solo ver como tienen el carro de suplido vacio y cuando salen de una habitacion lo hacen arrastrando las sabanas que eso se ve muy feo. Los ruidos del acensor no dejan a nadie descansar y las made desde el pelo de la mañana tirando las puertas tampoco. No vuelvo a quedarme en ese Hotel.

Bra beliggenhet | større rom en de fleste dobbeltrom. Vi hadde superior rom med 2 queensize og det fungerte  for 3 personer.  Har tidligere også bodd her i et standard dobbeltrom med 2 queen size. Helt ok rom | men superior/deluxe rom er bedre og ligger høyere oppe. Dermed får en både bedre utsikt og mindre støy. Perfekt beliggenhet i en sidegate på Times Square kort avstand til subwayOg alt av butikker| mat steder .

Olen yöpynyt tässä hotellissa monta kertaa| mutta viime kerrasta on kulunut jo vuosia joten odotin mielenkiinnolla että mikä hotellin taso on nykyään.Sisäänkirjautuminen sujui nopeasti ja henkilökunta oli ystävällistä. Huone oli siisti ja melko suuri New Yorkin mittapuulla mitattuna. Kävin hotellin kuntosalilla mikä on pieni| mutta sieltä löytyy kaikki peruslaitteet ja kuntopyörät/juoksumatot sekä käsipainot.Hotellin sijainti on loistava aivan Times Squaren vieressä ja tällä kertaa huoneesta oli myös näköala Times Squarelle mikä oli illalla mahtava näky. Ainoa moite minulla oli äänieristys naapuri huoneeseen.. aamulla kuulin mitä kanavaa naapuri katseli tv:stä eli äänieristys ei ole parhaasta päästä| mutta huoneessa oli yhdistävä ovi ko. Huoneeseen mikä varmasti vaikutti asiaan eli kannattaa pyytää huonetta missä ei ole yhditävää ovea naapurin kanssa niin se varmasti auttaa asiaan.Kokonaisuutena hyvä hotelli loistavalla sijainnilla ja voin suositella kaikille jotka haluavat yöpyä Times Squaren alueella.,Mar 2| 2020,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

La qualité des lits est bonne... mais les chambres sont très mal entretenues pour un 4 étoiles pas de plateau de courtoisie pas de peignoirs pas de chaussons rien!!! Un hôtel 4* en plein Times Square c’est indigne!!! De plus on arrive à l’hôtel impossibilité de régler sa chambre en espèce!!! Alors que ce n’est précisé nulle part. Le prix indiqué lors de la réservation ne correspond pas au prix payé à l’arrivée... les rideaux des chambres totalement défectueux et limite déchirésChambre au 45eme étage belle vue et spacieuse c’est le seul point positif.,Feb 26| 2020,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Im Grunde ein gepflegtes Hotel in guter Lage mit älterer| aber gediegener Einrichtung. Wasserkocher nicht mehr im Zimmer. Zum Schluss wird die Kreditkarte mit 25 Dollar plus Steuer belastet| für eigentlich nichts. Der Name "Urban Destination Charge" soll den Anschein einer staatlichen Steuer erwecken. Ist es aber nicht. Der Hotelmanager hätte deswegen in Deutschland sicher schon als Betrüger vor Gericht gestanden. Leider machen jetzt offenbar die meisten Hotels im Theaterdistrikt diese Art Straßenraub mit. Leider ein verbreitetes Problem dort| die Amis können einfach keine ehrlichen Preise anbieten. Wegen dieser üblen und lästigen Abzocke: Da fühlt man sich nicht willkommen.Daher nur zwei Punkte.,Feb 25| 2020,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Hôtel très bien situé. Accueil correct. La chambre était malpropre (muffin sur le tapis| rideaux tachés| vitres sales| tiroirs de la commode endommagés). L'eau du bain ne s'évacue pas quand on prend une douche| on entend très bien le bruit des ascenseurs| il n'y a pas de machine à café ni de mini-réfrigérateur| la ventilation de la salle de bain ne fonctionne pas| impossible de régler le thermostat car il semble pré-programmé| la tapisserie est sale et décolle par endroit.

Hohe Bewertung durch Top-Lage!Das Hotel ist sehr abgewohnt| es gibt keine Minibar| keinen Teekocher und die Heizung funktioniert nicht richtig (angeblich 26C sind eher 15C)| lediglich die Hotellobby sieht schön aus.ABER:Die Lage des Hotels ist toll um die meisten der Sehenswürdigkeiten zu erreichen - da sich diese eher im südlichen Teil NYC's befinden! Da das Hotel wirklich sehr nahe beim Times Square ist| kann es allerdings in der Nacht schon sehr laut werden. Der Vorteil: Die U-Bahnstation am Times Square ist sehr schnell erreichbar und von dort gehen Züge zu fast allen Sehenswürdigkeiten ohne umsteigen zu müssen.,Dec 31| 2019,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

NYでは2～2.5万出しても中クラスのホテルだと聞いていました。1泊15000円なので全く期待していなかったのですが、格式の高い一流ホテルで、且つ52階建ての51階で眺望も割とよく、1泊3～4万相当の部屋の様な感じでした。locationもタイムスクエアまで70０ｍと近く最高に便利で、非常に良かったです。再度泊まりたいです。,Nov 30| 2019,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

El lobby del hotel apestaba terriblemente a orina todos los días| y el personal que trabaja en esa área pareciera que no tenía olfato o que se ha acostumbrado a ese repugnante olor. Que tristeza.,May 29| 2019,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Det var sentralt| rett ved alt. Eneste jeg har å utsette på det var at sengen vi hadde var utrolig hard| og det gjør ikke underverker for ryggen min.

The room is super small and quite old| a big difference with the photo on the website.  We have 3 people but only 2 glasses in the bathroom.  No water boiler/tea and coffee/coffee cups and one light bulb is not working in the room.  Called front desk at 10pm but they replied that only one person was there and asked us to wait. We waited for 2 hours and no one showed up to bring us the things.  Next morning we talked to the lady who cleaned the rooms| she helped us to bring one glass and called her colleague to give us the coffee and coffee cups.  She also helped to call someone to fix the light bulb.  Forget to ask the lady's name but she was extremely helpful and we appreciated.  When we checked out| the front desk told us that a US$25 facility fee was charged daily| unhappy to pay the extra fee with terrible service in this hotel.,May 17| 2019,2,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

カウンターでのスタッフはとても丁寧でした。毎朝クリーニングスタッフもとてもフランクで会話も楽しかったです。ただ、クリーニング自体は念入りにクリーニングはしない様でして、ベッドシーツも変える事はせず、元の状態に戻すまででした。汚れてないので、自分は気になりませんが。,May 16| 2019,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Mycket hjälpsam och tillmötesgående personal. Särskilt att nämna Mr Tom Adams som hjälpte oss med transportbeställningar av taxi/town car från och till flygplatsen.Hotellets läge är ju perfekt!

Freundlich auch nicht immer... Das Hotel ist ziemlich veraltet. Die Badezimmer| wirklich nicht schön. Nicht sauber| sehr sehr veraltet. Also ehrlich gesagt| war ich froh weg von dieser Unterkunft zu sein. Klar die Lage ist ja top| aber das ist auch nicht immer alles. Man muss sich trotzdem wohl fühlen.

3박을하였는데 건물도 크고 가격대비 고급스러운 호텔이였습니다. 높은층에 배정을 해주어서 뷰도 좋았구요.  특히 타임스퀘어가 바로앞이라 위치적으로도 너무좋았습니다.  다만  조금 추워서  이불을 하나 더 요청했는데 깜깜 무소식이더라구요 ㅠㅜ. 서비는 측면에는 조금 아쉬었습니다. 가성비가 좋아 재방문 의사있습니다!,Mar 14| 2019,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Utrolig bra location i Midtown med kort vei til mange av byens severdigheter og kollektiv trafikk. Hotellet er ikke nytt men rommet var stort med veldig god plass. Det var rent og ryddig på hotellet| men det beste av alt var hvor service villige de var. Benedict Ng som er General Manager fikset opp ved den minste forespørsel| og ga oss en følelse av at vi var velkommen og at hotellet satt pris på at vi hadde valgt de for vårt opphold. Vi spurte bla. om en sen check out| og det var ingen problem. Vi har bodd på vesentlig dårligere hotel i NYC til en langt høyere pris tidligere. Vi sitter igjen med gode minner om en service minded betjening som gjorde alt de kunne for at vi skulle trives.

Das erste Zimmer habe ich noch mitten in der Nacht gewechselt| da ich plötzlich Käfer und anders Kriechzeug im Bett hatt. Das zweite Zimmer war dann ok. Die Betten werden nur jeden zweiten Tag gemacht oder eifach willkürlich. Jeden Morgen wartet man ca 20 Minuten bis man mit dem Lift in die Lobb kommt. Der Lift ist dann auch entsprechend brechend voll. Für den Preis welchen ich gezahlt hatt war ich sehr entäuscht.

Vi (familie på to voksne og to halvvoksne barn) hadde et glimrende opphold på Millennium Broadway i høstferien 2018. Fantastisk beliggenhet| flotte rom og svært hyggelig betjening. Hadde sendt mail med spørsmål om connecting rooms og utsikt| og fikk ved ankomst gratis oppgradert til superior-rom med nydelig utsikt over Times square - herlig. Det eneste som trakk opplevelsen noe ned var heissystemet| men jeg tror det var noe feil med det under vårt opphold. Vi spiste ikke frokost på hotellet| så den kan jeg ikke uttale meg om. Men uansett: Dette hotellet anbefales på det varmeste| jeg har nå bodd her to ganger og bor her gjerne igjen!,Oct 6| 2018,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Tutto molto bene| però I 2 letti erano stretti x 3| x mio figlio ok ma x  me e marito troppo stretto😊,Oct 14| 2018,4,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Das erste Zimmer habe ich noch mitten in der Nacht gewechselt| da ich plötzlich Käfer und anders Kriechzeug im Bett hatt. Das zweite Zimmer war dann ok. Die Betten werden nur jeden zweiten Tag gemacht oder eifach willkürlich. Jeden Morgen wartet man ca 20 Minuten bis man mit dem Lift in die Lobb kommt. Der Lift ist dann auch entsprechend brechend voll. Für den Preis welchen ich gezahlt hatt war ich sehr entäuscht. Einmal und nie wieder.,Oct 11| 2018,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036

Très bonne situation en revanche nous avions réservé une Chambre Deluxe et nous n’étions qu’au 17ème alors que l’hôtel en compte 54... la vue sur Times Square aurait été meilleure. Chambre propre mais un peu vieillotte... un jour on a carrément oublié de nous remettre des serviettes !! Peu mieux faire...,Oct 7| 2018,3,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
Vi (familie på to voksne og to halvvoksne barn) hadde et glimrende opphold på Millennium Broadway i høstferien 2018. Fantastisk beliggenhet| flotte rom og svært hyggelig betjening. Hadde sendt mail med spørsmål om connecting rooms og utsikt| og fikk ved ankomst gratis oppgradert til superior-rom med nydelig utsikt over Times square - herlig. Det eneste som trakk opplevelsen noe ned var heissystemet| men jeg tror det var noe feil med det under vårt opphold. Vi spiste ikke frokost på hotellet| så den kan jeg ikke uttale meg om. Men uansett: Dette hotellet anbefales på det varmeste| jeg har nå bodd her to ganger og bor her gjerne igjen!,Oct 6| 2018,5,Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square,145 W 44th St| New York| NY| 10036
