Great location.  We walked to most places.  Very clean.  We were a little disappointed the pool was closed but under the circumstances we absolutely understood.   On the first day we were there one of the elevators broke and since we were on the 19th floor it took a bit of time to move floors but the staff was trying to help and let us use the service elevator to cut down waits.  The staff was so friendly and helpful.  We'd stay here again.,Aug 19| 2021,5,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611
A great location. Big room with a wonderful city view. The small kitchen was very good since we have a baby.,Aug 14| 2021,5,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611
Pros:The staff was super friendly and helpful. The continental breakfast was great. The location was super! Close to a lot of places.Cons: The room could’ve been a bit cleaner (i.e. you could tell that the vacuuming wasn’t very thorough| mirror was streaky| etc) and had a bit of a smell.Pool was closed for maintenance. Parking wasn’t on site.,Aug 14| 2021,4,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611
Wish the gym and pool were open| but because of Covid they weren't,Aug 10| 2021,5,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611
We had a kitchenette unit and the full size refrigerator was a real benefit.   The bed was pleasantly comfortable.  The location was very walkable to the rail and bus and shopping.  We felt safe and avoided walking east under N Michigan Ave after dark and walked on E Ohio street instead.,Aug 9| 2021,5,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611
This property was perfectly situated downtown near the river walk and navy pier. I had a corner suite with a kitchenette and a great view. The train station and grocery store were about 2 blocks. Breakfast was included which was a treat,Aug 7| 2021,5,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611
The staff was very accommodating.,Aug 6| 2021,5,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611
The room was really clean and nice. Staff was helpful and friendly. Slight lack of communication in where to park and it costs $50 to park overnight to stay at the hotel,Aug 4| 2021,5,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611

Room needs updating but a good room for the price| great location,Jul 31| 2021,4,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611
Excellent location. Nearby Starbucks| Eataly| Nordstrom’s| CVS etc. Substantial hot breakfast buffet. Queen suite very good size for 3 people but sofa bed is terrible to sleep on. Cushions on the floor would be more comfortable.,Jul 30| 2021,4,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611
The property was very clean and the location was excellent. Parking was convenient and easily navigated. Staff were friendly and helpful. Even assisted me with retrieving tickets to the Willis Tower. I will definitely be staying here on future trips to Chicago.,Jul 30| 2021,5,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611
I highly recommend this place! Awesome location in downtown Chicago; well-maintained property|  clean room with kitchen (with small dishwasher| 2-burner stove & a full-size fridge| great for a long stay).  And the best is the excellent customer service| particularly Jeremy at the buffet breakfast. Will stay here again.,Jul 29| 2021,5,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611

Location is great but the furnishings in the room are a bit worn. Lobby is nice but it’s on the 6th floor and not street level so that is clunky.

I like how equiped with a full kitchen.  The bathroom was nice and clean..The room was good but no outlets by the bed that worked to charge your phone. The 1 elevator was down which caused a alot crowdness in the elevator because it was a long wait to catch the next one. Over all the room was good especially for longer trips.

The toilet leaked the carpet was soaking wet. The bathroom tub moved from what I assume was rotted wood. The room above us leaked the walls were wet. The room itself was great! Spacious| clean. I disliked how gross the walls were in the bathroom/bedroom.,May 24| 2021,2,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611
We moved from the first room she to a smoke smell (cigarette) in the room. They were very accommodating and moved us to a new room. Then| another party on the floor was loud and smoking (marijuana). I was told I was going to be brought air fresheners and they would send someone to walk the floors. Not sure if someone walked the floor but we were never brought air fresheners. The smell came in waves as they were constantly smoking. The next morning the smell came back stronger. I let them know and they said they were a non smoking facility and they would have the managers walk the floor. Both encounters the staff was super nice but I felt like there was no follow through and the smell unfortunately occurred throughout our entire stay. This hotel used to be our #1 place to stay with our kids. We even recommended this hotel to our family and friends. We will not be doing so anymore and this wteekend was our last weekend that we will stay at this property.The pool is also still closed which I did know about prior and was told we would get bagged breakfast instead of the continental. The pound cake| nature valley bar| and yogurt was a bit of a disappointment as well. Not sure why bagels with cream cheese or something more substantial wasn't an option. The staff has always been kind and friendly but unfortunately that doesn't outweigh the cons that were experienced.,May 24| 2021,2,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611

It was a excellent and very clean the only downside was paying 40 dollars a night for parking that was across the street in a parking garage. Didn’t know about the extra cost till I checked in.,Apr 25| 2021,5,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611

I would never return again. First thing is you are not told that they ONLY offer off site parking (parking garage) that you would have to pay $45 a day to park. To make matters worse the elevators were broke in the garage which caused my self and my children to walk down stairs with 4 large luggage. From the moment I walked in I didn’t feel comfortable. The small lobby entrance (which looks like a basement) has people just sitting around who didn’t even have reservations. Once I finally checked in. I specially requested a 2 bed Non Smoking room and I received the opposite with an extra dose of marijuana smoke. The rooms were nasty. Stains all over the walls and it looked as if it hasn’t been cleaned in a few days. They did however swap us out to another room. Which was still subpar. Our originally stay was reserved for 7 days. We just stayed the 1 night and went to another comfortable hotel for the remaining nights.,Apr 22| 2021,1,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611

It was so comfortable we wished we could of stayed longer. There was plenty to see and do because of the location of the hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The only thing is when we checked in I was told I would get the deposits back when I checked out and I have yet to get them.,Apr 20| 2021,5,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611
We loved our stay. It was so comfortable we wish we could of stayed longer. It’s basically the heart of downtown| so there is so much to see and do as well. However| when we checked in we was told we would receive the $400 deposit back when we checked out minus the $90 total for parking and $4 for a drink. I still have not received it.,Apr 20| 2021,5,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611

It was a excellent and very clean the only downside was paying 40 dollars a night for parking that was across the street in a parking garage. Didn’t know about the extra cost till I checked in.,Apr 25| 2021,5,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611

I would never return again. First thing is you are not told that they ONLY offer off site parking (parking garage) that you would have to pay $45 a day to park. To make matters worse the elevators were broke in the garage which caused my self and my children to walk down stairs with 4 large luggage. From the moment I walked in I didn’t feel comfortable. The small lobby entrance (which looks like a basement) has people just sitting around who didn’t even have reservations. Once I finally checked in. I specially requested a 2 bed Non Smoking room and I received the opposite with an extra dose of marijuana smoke. The rooms were nasty. Stains all over the walls and it looked as if it hasn’t been cleaned in a few days. They did however swap us out to another room. Which was still subpar. Our originally stay was reserved for 7 days. We just stayed the 1 night and went to another comfortable hotel for the remaining nights.,Apr 22| 2021,1,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611

There are only 2 elevators in thr whole hotel.  You have to wait for ever for one.  Later on in the eveming the line to get on is ridiculous.  We were lined up outsude just to get into our hotel to use thr elevator.   The smell of Marijuana throughout the hotel hallways were strong!   The free breakfast was a joke.  I do realize because of covid they could not do a normal breakfast but we had to pay extra for our 2 kids to get the free sack breakfast| an orange|  orange juice|  a slimy muffin and a breakfast bar.

My husband was very happy with the space. He was able to work on his computer in the kitchen/living room area while I slept in the early morning. The room was comfortable with a nice corner city view. I can't believe that any hotel room these days would not have a full length mirror. Also| the bed coverings were minimal and the heater was noisy. There were a few minor issues with the condition of the room| like the towel rack falling off the wall that could be fixed. It was a good price for what it is and it would certainly be a fine place to stay again. It was very busy at the end of March with a lot of families and activity.,Mar 29| 2021,4,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611

Parking was across the street - 2 minute walk from the hotel. We stayed during Covid so there was no breakfast or evening social but we had a small kitchen (stovetop/refrigerator/and microwave/toaster w/ basic utensils/pots/pans/dishes/glassware). There was no daily housekeeping (not a problem for us) but staff willing to drop off any needs (ice/towels). Easy access to bus or train/2 blocks by foot to Michigan Ave. Staff was exceptional.  We would stay here again,Mar 27| 2021,5,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611
The location is excellent for enjoying the sites of downtown Chicago| enjoying meals at restaurants and getting food to prepare in your suite. Suite was clean.  Bed was comfortable.

The room that we stayed in was a corner room with tall windows and a window sill that was about 1 foot off of the floor. Of course our 2 year old son wanted nothing more than to climb on the window sills but| even though the windows appeared to be bolted and locked| it made my husband and I nervous (we were on the 11th floor). I sat on the window sill to keep our son from getting on the sill and noticed that a small window in the corner did not look like it was sealed. I attempted to open it and to my horror the window could be completely opened. Had my son discovered this| he could have easily opened it and fallen out. After getting myself back together I spoke with the front desk attendant| Star I believe| and she was quick in finding out whether the security guard on duty could lock the window. He could not| so she comped our night and gave us another room| on the same floor.... that also had unlocked windows. Third time was the charm| the third room had all locked windows and we moved. The point of this review is so that people with small children are aware that this is a possibility in your room at this hotel. There should be some sort of disclaimer when booking these rooms making buyers aware of this possibility before someone is seriously hurt. In my opinion this is extremely unsafe and concerning. People should be able to be comfortable and not have to watch their children like a hawk INSIDE of a hotel room to ensure they don’t fall out of an 11th floor window!,Mar 14| 2021,3,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611

Overall the room was fine. Just little things that were over looked. The tub needs to be refinished in the suite. Looked like it was dirty but the material was just wearing away. I hate my sheets didn’t fit the bed. It was like house keeping only had one size sheets with them and didn’t feel like getting the proper size. So they forced a queen sheet on a king size bed. Which kept popping off. I don’t like when my sheet expose the mattress but didn’t complain because i didn’t want someone to have to enter the room.,Jan 25| 2021,4,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611

The bed was the most uncomfortable. Had a gard time sleeping which never happens when we stay in hotels both of us work up with back and hip pain. The pillows were really flat so if you like hard pillows bring your own. Over all cleanliness was alrught when looking a little closer dried toothpast on the floor in the bathroom and phone was all greasy and spills on the end stands.,Dec 28| 2020,3,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611

At the last minute| my guy & I aborted my bday trip to LA (because..Covid)| and chose 2 do an extended staycation here.. The location is cool| and both| Trader Joe’s and Jewel are a short walk away..  Just about everything was wonderful| from check-in to check-out.....except that we had to call the front desk multiple times for missed details| as we discovered them.. We called for dish towels| dishwashing liquid| dishwasher detergent| paper towels| additional face/bath towels| a light bulb (yes)| etc.. I believe| with the knowledge that we would be there for 5 nights| that all of those things should have been in place.. Even if they were sick of us (i.e. me) calling| however| they never expressed it with words| nor tone.. We got what we needed| and they even gave us a few pairs of latex gloves| as we’d forgotten our own.. Nice..The only other slight bummer may not matter to many; but| the TVs are not “Smart|” and we couldn’t watch our fave shows on the “big screen”.. We made do| though| and used my laptop when we wanted; so....extreme crisis averted.. At any rate| this was definitely a beautiful stay for us| overall.. We’ll be back again..,Nov 26| 2020,5,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611
Hope covid is over soon cause i can not wait to come back when everything is available again.,Nov 23| 2020,4,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611
Great location and friendly staff. Room was very spacious and clean| great views from our corner unit suite. We knew about Covid and didn't mind the lack of amenities.

My room was ok. I didn't feel it was clean. I don't know if it was due to the smell of cigarettes| the two smoked cigarettes I found behind the night stand while looking for the outlet to plug my phone because the decorative lamp with USB port was not work or the dirt on the rug.

I stayed at the Homewood Suites over the weekend for my fiancé birthday to surprise him. From the time I got there| checked in and checked out| everything was smooth! I told the front desk it was a surprise and that I had to decorate| they were more than helpful keeping it a secret when he came to the hotel| beautiful view of the city they put us on the 10th floor| great size for the both of us| right in the heart of everything!

This hotel doesn’t honor what is advertising on internet. Staff was very slow and not helpful at all. I requested a nonsmoking room but it wasn’t. I couldn’t sleep until 4am because the smoke was coming through the AC and impossible to breath. I called the staff| she said put a towel underneath the door! I said smoke is coming from AC| she said that she couldn’t do anything about it. No cleaning services| dirty towels| dirty bed sheets| no hot breakfast or breakfast at all. If you can’t serve breakfast because of the current COVID situation| just don’t advertise it. That’s unfortunate for a hotel that is in a great area with such a nice space to have a very bad service!,Jul 21| 2020,2,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611

The hotel staff was very friendly| the room was clean and the location was perfect for us. The only downside if you run out of tissue after 5 you will have to wait until after 8 to get more. Best advise order everything you may need before 5. I do understand due to Covid-19 things are operating different but that’s a big inconvenience Especially when each suite is stocked with 1 roll for a family of 5. Even with that small hiccup we will most definitely be visiting this hotel again.,Jul 18| 2020,5,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611
I stayed at the Homewood Suites over the weekend for my fiancé birthday to surprise him. From the time I got there| checked in and checked out| everything was smooth! I told the front desk it was a surprise and that I had to decorate| they were more than helpful keeping it a secret when he came to the hotel| beautiful view of the city they put us on the 10th floor| great size for the both of us| right in the heart of everything! Extremely satisfied with our stay!,Jul 29| 2020,5,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611

Because of the time I travelled I wanted somewhere with an indoor pool. The indoor pool was nice and clean. Easy access to major attractions within walking distance.

The elevator situation is an absolute NIGHTMARE. My fiancé and I found ourselves climbing 15 flights of stairs multiple times during our stay.

The pool was great! The staff is nice. The heating system in the rooms was wack. It was either turn off or blast heat that couldn’t be regulated to a certain degree. The heater would make the room unbearably hot and staff said it was unfortunately all or nothing during the winter and told me to crack the windows to regulate the temperature. It wasn’t really helpful and created a cold breeze for my kids. It was cold at night.  It was a nice stay but I would avoid it for this reason.,Jan 25| 2020,5,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611

The manager when we check in was the worst! Very unprofessional and no customer service skills at all! I would’ve have left but my son wanted to stay. Never again will I go back!,Jan 28| 2020,2,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611

Overall hotel was perfect. Room was clean and quite.  Hotel location was great.  Right downtown.  Only below grade would be the free breakfast.  Staff was friendly but the food not so.

This hotel was fine. Service was decent| free breakfast was par (it was a buffet style with french toast| scrambled eggs| tots| sausages| and other options)| and room with kitchenette is very cool. Problem with some stains left on the bathroom floor| so cleanliness is questionable. Everything else looked OK from a cleaning point of view| but it does make you wonder. The pool area DO NOT HAVE A HOT TUB. So if that is important to you| stay somewhere else. That was almost a bummer for us| but we didn't have our kids with so it ended up being OK. Valet parking in Chicago is outrageously priced; that being said| this hotel's valet service was as described| and the car was in same condition and had not been noticeably driven other than being parked. Google maps says this hotel is off OHIO street but if you look carefully you enter off GRAND avenue.

The hotel is located close to many restaurants (including family friendly ones) and bars for adult time. The staff was all very pleasant and the breakfast was really good and refreshed in a timely manner. All of the bellhop staff was excellent with directions or whatever we needed. Two small complaints. The lock on the men's bathroom in the pool area was not functioning properly. And the men's bathroom on the lobby level was not clean on Sunday afternoon. Multiple stalls were in disarray.

Wonderful location. We walked everywhere. The stop for the free Navy Pier trolley is steps away. We had a one-bedroom suite for a grandmother| daughter| grandson and nephew. Plenty of room for everyone. Breakfast was good. Evening social hour was ample and made for a quick dinner one night before heading out. Food was "buffet" quality = good!

What I found to be impressive about this hotel is how well the noise from the city did not find its way into my suite or common areas. Beautiful views of the city surround the hotel| however| you do not have to hear it. The sixth floor combines the front desk with a comfortable seating area and a dining room offering a great view. Be sure to take advantage of the evening social on the sixth floor where free food and beverages are provided.,Aug 2| 2019,5,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611

Great location and the front desk service is wonderful. Very nice ladies.  Rooms were perfect.

First of all| the hotel was in a fantastic part of the city and was close to everything. The free Trolley from Navy Pier dropped us off right by the hotel. The hotel was clean| staff friendly and helpful| and the free breakfast was good. When I checked in| we were given a room with a pretty terrible view when I had paid extra for a room with a view. I was told that someone “gave away” my room| but thankfully they had a room available with a view. That room was wonderful with a spectacular view. I’m glad I said something| but I shouldn’t have needed to. Another frustration was the slowness of the elevators. They were small and slow.  I think the freight elevator was broken| so there was a time during checkout that I needed to wait because it was being used for laundry. All in all| I enjoyed my stay| and would stay here again.,Jul 22| 2019,5,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611

I loved the amount of space. It was really nice to have a kitchen with a full refrigerator to use. When on vacation| I don't like to have to go to a restaurant for every meal| so that was a plus if I wanted to just cook a meal in my room. The free breakfast options were good. I wished I remembered the free dinner as well. Monday-Thursday they serve free dinner that includes wine and beer. There is also an on site laundry room| so I went home with clean clothes making it one less thing to do coming home from vacation. This location is around the corner from Eataly and a couple blocks from Magnificent Mile. The staff was friendly and helpful. I look forward to another stay here again.

Our first time at this hotel in the heart of Chicago| and we could not have been happier! Great location| smart room layout| friendly staff| superb housekeeping (16th floor).

Our first time at this hotel in the heart of Chicago| and we could not have been happier! Great location| smart room layout| friendly staff| superb housekeeping (16th floor). Many families stayed here during spring break| which could be felt during breakfast| dinner social| and at times at the pool. However| the dining staff moved at an amazing speed and efficiency| we never had any issues.,Mar 29| 2019,5,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611

You enter in ground level in a tiny “lobby” and forced to go directly into the smallest elevators I’ve ever seen for a hotel. The main lobby is on the 6th floor.  There are 19 floors with only two small elevators so you are constantly waiting for the elevators and at times having to hit the button a few times to wait for an empty elevator.

We would have cancelled our stay becasue our children did not sleep for 2 days in a rown becasue of the noise. UNACCEPTABLE. When I addressed it with the front desk they basically said it was out of their control with no remedy and no fix to the situation.  They also said they could not comp a day or discount becasue we had booked through expedia.

Was in town for a short 3-day conference. Business center was basic and clearly seemed geared toward tourists who needed to print maps as it was in a very public/noisy location.  Breakfast was ok/blah with lots of processed food options.  Skip it| go somewhere else if your interest is flavor or nutrition. Location was surrounded by a plethora of mid-grade restaurants. Thst was good. A nice surprise was Eataly on the same block as the hotel.  Its possible to get fresh meats cheeses and keep in room refrigerator for snacks.  The daily room refresh tended to forget the little things.  No coffee packets on day one|  no coffee cups on day two and the coffee pod tray was missing for day three. Clearly the cleaning staff didn't like for guests to make coffee in the room machine. WI-fi worked as promised.  AC/Heat worked well.  Room to Room and hallway noise was not an issue. Street noise was a bit on the loud side but that's Chicago for you. (loudest sirens on the planet!)  Front counter staff were very friendly but sometimes distracted by other staff.  Hotel seemed secure but we had to have our room cards reactivated every day as they would quit working and prevented access to our room and the elevator keys. Not a bad place to stay by any means but be prepared to take care of issues by yourself (Perhaps that's good life advice too),Oct 7| 2018,3,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611

When I addressed it with the front desk they basically said it was out of their control with no remedy and no fix to the situation.  They also said they could not comp a day or discount becasue we had booked through expedia. Are you kidding| this is ridiculous.,Oct 25| 2018,2,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611

The staff is out of this world!  Working hard serving a great breakfast and superb happy hour.The rooms are very nice| with a small living room| kitchen and separate bedroom.Hotel is just a VERY short block from the GRAND/STATE red line subway station.  We will be back.,Oct 21| 2018,5,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611
Check in was great!  They upgraded our room and gave us a bottle of wine for our anniversary!  The next morning they were very pleasant and conversational!,Oct 14| 2018,4,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611
It was in the perfect location near everything you could possibly need. The staff was very attentive and courteous,Oct 10| 2018,5,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611
Was in town for a short 3-day conference. Business center was basic and clearly seemed geared toward tourists who needed to print maps as it was in a very public/noisy location.  Breakfast was ok/blah with lots of processed food options.  Skip it| go somewhere else if your interest is flavor or nutrition. Location was surrounded by a plethora of mid-grade restaurants. Thst was good. A nice surprise was Eataly on the same block as the hotel.  Its possible to get fresh meats cheeses and keep in room refrigerator for snacks.  The daily room refresh tended to forget the little things.  No coffee packets on day one|  no coffee cups on day two and the coffee pod tray was missing for day three. Clearly the cleaning staff didn't like for guests to make coffee in the room machine. WI-fi worked as promised.  AC/Heat worked well.  Room to Room and hallway noise was not an issue. Street noise was a bit on the loud side but that's Chicago for you. (loudest sirens on the planet!)  Front counter staff were very friendly but sometimes distracted by other staff.  Hotel seemed secure but we had to have our room cards reactivated every day as they would quit working and prevented access to our room and the elevator keys. Not a bad place to stay by any means but be prepared to take care of issues by yourself (Perhaps that's good life advice too),Oct 7| 2018,3,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611

There were different price options. I chose the highest option for the same kind of room because I thought it would be up higher. Was put on the bottom floor.

Very straight forward check-in & check-out in safe & secure building. Apartment style room was very clean| well lit| spacious and well maintained with daily housekeeping. The kitchenette is a great facility with a hob| refrigerator| coffee / tea maker| cutlery| pots & pans etc. and good storage for food etc. The hotel is well located with shops for groceries nearby and only a 5 minute walk from Michigan Avenue. Ideal location for visiting the major tourist attractions and the Big Bus Tour have a stop within a 5 minute walk. The red line metro has a stop only a minute walk from the hotel but its location makes it easy to walk anywhere in the city centre.

レッドラインのgrand駅から歩いて１分程度の好立地にあります。部屋はいわゆる１LDKで広く風呂場（バスタブあり）も大変清潔。キッチンには大きな冷蔵庫にオーブンレンジも備え、近くのスーパーで買った分厚いステーキ肉を焼いて楽しみました。更に素晴らしいのが月〜木の17:00〜19:00にはロビーで軽食とアルコールのサービスもあります。ビールはサーバーから自分で注ぐ形式で飲み放題。私が宿泊したのがオフシーズンだったこともありこんなに快適なホテルに格安で滞在することができとても感謝しています。是非また利用したい。,Jan 25| 2020,5,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611

地下鉄駅から1ブロック、周辺にはレストランやスパーマーケットもたくさんあり、大変便利だと思います。  部屋はこのホテルでは一般的な部屋だと思いますが大変広いSUITESで、大きな冷蔵庫付きのキッチンもあり、おそらく周辺の高級ホテルにも引けを取らないと思います。静かで立地と部屋には大満足です。  朝１０時頃に着いたのですが、チェックインもさせてくれました。  チェックアウトが早かったので無料の朝食はたべていません。ロビーなどは簡素で色々な施設があるのかどうかはわかりません。   季節にもよるのかも知れませんが、この価格では絶対お勧めです。,Jan 27| 2019,5,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611

Das Hotel ist fussläufig zur City und zum Pier gelegen. Wir hatten ein Zimmer mit View gebucht| die paar Euro kann man sich sparen| wir schauten auf ein Dach mit vielen Klimaanlagen und ein Parkhaus. Die Zimmer bieten für Familien ausreichend Platz. Allerdings konnten unsere Kinder auf dem Schlafsofa nicht schlafen. Die Federkernmatratze drückte die Federn durch. Leider war auch kein Ersatz vorhanden. Positiv anzumerken ist| dass in der Woche ein kostenfreier Imbiss ab 17:00 Uhr angoten wird.,Aug 9| 2018,3,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611

Hôtel très confortable mais ménage en chambre irrégulier (2 jours sur 7 non faits )Petit déjeuner plutôt sympathique avec un personnel agréable et efficace mais cela manque un peu de fruits et de diversités.Vue bluffante (Trump tower Tribune tower...) au 12ème étage pour notre chambre 1217. Belle piscine avec vue idem pour la salle de fitness au 17ème étage.Nous avions une petite cuisine et faisions les courses  très près au supermarché Traders joe à 400 m deux rues derrière. Emplacement idéal proche des restaurants| du lac de la plage et du pier et juste à côté du El Train (métro).Seul bémol| le deuxième lit est un canapé lit et il ne convient pas aux adultes car on a vite fait de sentir les ressorts.Wifi excellent.,Jul 29| 2018,4,Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,40 East Grand Avenue| Chicago| IL| 60611
Adoramos o hotel e o quarto| o checkin que fica no 6 andar (única coisa estranha mas é porque os outros andares é de outras empresas) é muito rápido| os atendentes extremamentes cordiais 24x7 e sempre atentos para ajudar| tem uma mini lojinha para o que precisar e coloca o valor na conta do quarto| sempre tem happy hour no final do dia com chopp vinho e algumas comidas como cortesia| os quartos são lindos grandes camas boas ou seja não faltou nada| muito bom mesmo e em uma ótima localização.
