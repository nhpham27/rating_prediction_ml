Beautiful pool area on the 5th floor and warm cookies at checkin. Great location| easy walk to shopping and dining in the downtown area.,Aug 19| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
Family loved the pool.,Aug 18| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611

The room had no microwave. We had food leftovers that went to waist. Chicago cost for food was to expensive not to be able to eat what we had left.,Aug 18| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
Our family of four stayed for 3 nights. My husband is in a wheelchair and the hotel was accessible. We did not request an accessible room so his only struggle was the bathroom| or fault| not the hotels. The chair lift and elevator to the roof top pool were in working order. It should be noted that handicap parking was on the 5th floor of the garage. We enjoyed how convenient it was to get to everything using our car as parking was unlimited ins and outs.,Aug 17| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
Really enjoyed the pool and the comfort of the room. It was a little noisy at night but that is because of the bachelorette party across the hall from us so can’t be helped too much by the hotel. Overall great stay| great location,Aug 17| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
Stay was okay. We picked this hotel specifically for the outdoor pool.  we wanted to use the pool both days we were there. Unfortunately the pool was being worked on and we were unable to use it on our second day there. The first day we got there we didn’t get a full day at the pool. The bathrooms at the pool were pretty dirty and not cleaned. We stayed for our anniversary and just felt it wasn’t the best place. They do have a nice location. Easy to walk to the river and other places.,Aug 17| 2021,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
The stay was ok but they are not very kid friendly. They yelled at us twice for our kids being too loud in the lobby which they weren’t even that loud. And $60 a night to park is ridiculous.,Aug 17| 2021,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
DoubleTree staff was very professional and friendly. Starbucks coffee in the lobby was convenient every morning. Rooftop pool area was exceptional for Chicago. Rooms were comfortable and adequate. Only negative were very slow elevators| but it was an extremely crowded weekend with guests| Bears game| White Sox/Yankees| art exhibits in town. Convenient to everything in downtown Chicago and Navy pier. Great place to stay! Yolk and D4 Irish Pub are a couple minutes away| along with other great places to eat.,Aug 17| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
Great location.  Wonderful staff.  Bathroom drains were awful| very much clogged.  Pool was opaquely cloudy| and deck was dirty.,Aug 17| 2021,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
Excellent location| convenient to shops and attractions. Very friendly doormen. Very friendly employees at the bar and Starbucks. Cleaning person was very friendly. Front desk staff not as friendly as i would of expected. Not rude| but i expected a happier more engaging demeanor especially since they are your frontline staff.,Aug 17| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
Great location and overall clean and comfortable. There were some stains on our bath vanity that weren’t cleaned the entire time we were there but otherwise we thought it was clean. The downside was there were never clean towels out at the pool and there was a wait for elevators from 8am to 8pm without fail.  It would be nice to have drink and snack service by the pool. Next time I would stay on a low floor due to the elevator issue.,Aug 17| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
Rooms were clean and hotel well kept. Staff was helpful in getting us acquainted with Chicago and pool was nice. Service was slow for getting extra towels and there was never towels available at the pool. It would be nice to have a breakfast included for the price we paid.,Aug 16| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
We had dirty towels in our bathroom upon arrival.  Also the sink in our bathroom was clogged or not draining properly.  The staff quickly fixed both problems.  Overall good stay.  Did not like the limited elevators for such a large building.  Also the pool was crowded| maybe an adult only swim time and a hot tub would be good additions.,Aug 16| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
We booked a 3 night stay and at check-in we were asked if we would like our room cleaned and we said yes. Our room was never cleaned the entire time| our first morning we were getting ready to leave and housekeeping knocked on the door and we let her know we would be leaving shortly and she gave me a couple of towels and said they would come back to our room after we left but they never did. We asked them the next day as we were leaving to see if we could get our room cleaned but it never happened. The staff was short and almost rude when we asked about getting a cart to get our luggage and belongings to our car the morning we left. The hotel itself was nice and appeared to be clean and there is a Starbucks located inside which made it nice for morning coffee. The location of the hotel is wonderful and not far from all of the fun attractions in the city.,Aug 16| 2021,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
I loved how convenient the location is. We were able to walk to the arcade| navy pier and much more my kids age 5 & 10 years old loved it very much. Only thing I disliked was how long the elevators took and also I was told to wait until Sunday to check if I could pay for a late checkout. Sunday at 4am I asked the man working in the lobby if I could do a late check out and he said I had to wait until Sunday for check out and I said but it is Sunday and he said ut wasn’t until 10am? Lol ok buddy!!! Other than that everything was great! Also couldn’t get a late checkout if you were wondering.,Aug 16| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611

Nothing remarkable at all. Our room was beat up. Broken curtain pulls| loose laminate. Bathroom had zero counter space. Room had only one towel. We requested more| but never got any. Should have been much better for the price.,Aug 14| 2021,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
Located near but not in the press of traffic - a block east of Michigan Avenue - the hotel is very comfortable in both the room and lobby area. We did not use the pool| but a number of guests| especially those with children made good use of it. There is a grocery immediately next door to the hotel and a number of restaurants in easy walking distance.,Aug 13| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611

There was animal hair all over the area rug in my room. There were forehead prints on the windows and sticky glass rings on the end table by the couch and the top of the dresser. There were little black pieces (of what I have no idea) all over the bathroom sink. I have stayed at other Hilton properties and they have always been extremely clean. I was highly disappointed with the cleanliness of this property. Also| you pay to park your car yourself. And I ended up having to carry my luggage and bags down four flights of stairs. The concierge said that there was an elevator| however he neglected to say where it was. As I was taking some of my bags to my car before checkout I saw that there was a sign hanging from the ceiling of the parking garage. I would have expected the signs to be more eye level so that people would see them. Overall| I was very unhappy with my room and the parking situation.

The price of parking in their garage was disappointing.  I saw online that you could do it cheaper if your car stayed put.  When I asked the front desk I was told no.  Be smarter than me and park across the street from the hotel.  It is two cross walks and then you are there!  It isn't covered| so that is the only bad thing.  Google parking in Chicago for cheaper options than $59 a night.  That is really my only complaint with the hotel.,Aug 1| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611

I liked the hotel but the first day our room only had 2 towels and wash clothes.  We had 3 in the room and no hand towels.  I requested additional towels 5 times and was told they would deliver| but they never did.  Thank goodness I could talk to a housekeeper the next morning and she placed clean towels in our room.,Jul 31| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611

The price of parking in their garage was disappointing.  I saw online that you could do it cheaper if your car stayed put.  When I asked the front desk I was told no.  Be smarter than me and park across the street from the hotel.  It is two cross walks and then you are there!  It isn't covered| so that is the only bad thing.  Google parking in Chicago for cheaper options than $59 a night.  That is really my only complaint with the hotel.,Aug 1| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
Great place to stay.The air conditioner in my room was loud| so had to turn it off.You get free cookies at the front desk.,Aug 1| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611

Check in was pathetic especially being at the children's hospital down the street. We had enough drama and stress in our life. Check in was dramatic and the people wheir snobby and very rude. They said we used hotels.com so booking with them we would have had better service. They kept referring me as the wrong name. I also had to spell my name multiple times and they still couldn't find it. I ended up unleashing the wild stressed out wife loose on them.

Our room was beautiful! We had my two stepsons with us| neither of whom has travelled much| and neither had been to Chicago before. Everything from check-in (yay free cookies!) to our comfy bed and huge windows was fantastic. We stayed in a corner room with a king bed and a pull-out sofa| and when I called to get linens for the pull-out bed| I didn’t catch her name| but the woman who brought the sheets helped me put the sheets on the bed and even ran back to get a different mattress cover when the first one was a little dirty.

When we returned back to our room to turn in for the night| we noticed the shower looked as if it wasn't clean because there was hair in it and the floor was wet;  the sheets and pillows smelled of mildew and the carpet had not been vacuumed.  However| the service was very good they offered to come and change the sheets and any other things we needed all but I felt that it was too late because we were already ready for bed and it was late.

The Staff at DoubleTree Hilton were friendly and helped to all our needs. The bedding was okay but need to be updated with full memory foam for better comfort.  Also| We were disappointed that there wasn’t any access to the television for our own video accessories through HDMI ports for my son to watch Amazon or Netflix. So many hotels have this feature and we thought that would have been a great perk since we were not interested in any of the available broadcast DoubleTree Hilton provided.

The Staff at DoubleTree Hilton were friendly and helped to all our needs. The bedding was okay but need to be updated with full memory foam for better comfort.  Also| We were disappointed that there wasn’t any access to the television for our own video accessories through HDMI ports for my son to watch Amazon or Netflix. So many hotels have this feature and we thought that would have been a great perk since we were not interested in any of the available broadcast DoubleTree Hilton provided. Love the cookies!,Jul 10| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611

On word: cockroaches. Stay literally anywhere else. I stayed for two nights over the 4th of July weekend| and while the first night was okay| I came back to my room the second night and saw a cockroach crawling up my headboard. I immediately packed my stuff and checked out of the room. The overnight front desk person was nice and offered another room| but I knew I wouldn’t sleep. I ended up sleeping on a friend’s couch| and thank goodness I had local friends!!! That was the most major issue| but there were minor issues as well. First| there were no tongs with the ice pail| and despite calling and asking for some and being told some tongs were on the way| we never did get tongs. Okay| no big deal| I thought. I booked this place for the rooftop pool| and the pool itself is a lot of fun. Unfortunately| there are no rules about music| so multiple people were blasting competing| terrible music| and it definitely affected the vibe. We went out to the pool at around 1PM| and there were no towels. We asked for towels| and the staff person told us that the person who washes towels wouldn’t be in until 3PM. They did come back to the pool with about eight towels| but we only managed to get one to share for four people. When I called to get a refund for the second night| the person I spoke to was argumentative| impatient| and unhelpful. I had to call three times because she hung up after answering one question each time. I have to wait 3-5 business days to see if the refund| so we’ll see,Jul 7| 2021,1,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
AC didn't work the fan in the bathroom didn't work. There was no concierge there was puke on the elevator no breakfast available even though the website. Would never stay there again,Jul 7| 2021,1,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611

Had early check in and room wasn’t ready. White guy with a nose piercing didn’t help at all. I ordered 2  rooms and requested they be next or across from each other.. My husband and I took my daughter out for her 14 birthday so her and her friend can have their own room| However since I didn’t put “Kids” on the reservation they put our rooms on separate floors and refused/ said they had NO rooms available on either floor.. Just a big inconvenience seems like he was to busy trying to be a big shot to actually help.

Had a nice stay over the Holiday weekend. The rooms| lobby and elevators are well kept. Staff is very friendly and kind. The pool was a little underwhelming and the addition of covid restrictions and the holiday crowd didn’t make it better - as well as the coffee and food area in the lobby. Would consider staying again but I would also be curious in trying other options in the area for the price point though.,Jul 6| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611

The hotel itself is fine. Great location and parking is easy (but EXPENSIVE). My biggest gripe is housekeeping. Maybe it’s covid| but we stayed for 5 days and had no housekeeping. When I asked for it| I was told I needed to schedule it 24hrs in advance which wasn’t explained when we checked in. We have 2 small children so there is a limited window when they wouldn’t be napping.

This is a really nice hotel in a great location. Staff was friendly| beds were comfy| pool was warm- the only thing I wish were different is that I wish you could sit outside on the rooftop deck at night.

Front desk is alot to be desired.  They never informed us of the fact that your key card is required in the elevator to even get to your floor. Can't visit people on other floors because your key card will only let you access your floor.  If you don't scan your key card fast enough in the elevator before it takes off| you will have fun riding the elevator up and down several floors before you can get it to work.  ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE.  Many of the guests around me were frustrated with the same thing. I understand its a security requirement| but they need to tell guests about it up front upon check in so they know what to do.  Also| I was in the one bedroom suite and there was a huge disgusting white liquid stain on the backside of one of sofa bed cushions.,Jun 29| 2021,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611

My first time in Chicago with my husband for a relaxing weekend so I wanted a place to stay close to the Pier & Magnificent Mile so I found this hotel in the Gold Coast area. Shopping & the pier were close walking distance| just step out the front door and head to the left for the pier & to the right for shopping. I was impressed by the rooftop pool| very clean & the lawn chairs & umbrellas were of impeccable quality. The pool looks like it does in the photos & the view is incredible. I believe this might be the only hotel with an outdoor pool| so that was a plus. There is a Whole Foods across the street & a convenience store next door if you need anything. I liked that in order to use the elevator in the hotel| you need a room key - which was important because I felt safe. Highly recommend this hotel & will stay here again.,Jun 5| 2021,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611

One of the worst experience I have had at a Hilton. Our room was on clean 1 day. We did not get new towels after asking 4 times. When I spoke with the agent checking out the only thing he had to say was he offered me a bottle of water.

I like how close it was to everything in walking distance. Didn’t like that we were using toilet paper that was from previous person who stayed. Didn’t like how it took me forever to get a roll of toilet paper when I needed to go tot he bathroom. Our coffee area in the room wasn’t  restocked. Cups were missing and half the cream and sugar were gone. We were denied water bottles because we booked with Expedia instead of Hilton.

New room has a bathtub with a giant puddle of chemical on floor which resulted in extremely slippery shower for entire stay| and with little ones … not so safe .

Amazing hotel! Great location.

I loved my stay here. Staff was professional and friendly and the room was clean and comfortable. I love staying at DoubleTree hotels when I’m near one and this was no exception.

I had a 3 night stay. The property was well kept; Clean; There were some really attentive and extremely helpful staffs while there were a few that weren’t so much. Besides the hotel being decent it didn’t have much more too offer. THEY DONT offer breakfast in bed!!! No room service for breakfast| which was extremely disappointing. The breakfast buffet was $25pp and it didn’t even offer pancakes as a selection! Food had no flavor| staff in the breakfast area were rude with the exception of a gentleman who was very nice and helpful. As we were seated we walked over to the tiny area available for the breakfast buffet. My boyfriend and I began to serve ourselves asked for pancakes or waffles which were not available at the buffet and we were told we’d have to order them from the actual menu. When the menu was handed to us the waffles were 17.99!!! And the pancakes another 10.00!! Of course we didn’t order none of them considering the buffet was already 25 plus tax and of course gratuity. We pursue to  eat our breakfast and as we take our first bite nothing had any taste. At that point I dropped my fork and we decided to go elsewhere. My bf and I are complete foodies! We love food and don’t mind paying but these prices for the minimal selection they had to offer was NOT worth it. I’ve stayed at multiple HILTONS and they usually offer some amazing breakfasts and room service. Not this place. They do have a mini Starbucks. We Won’t be returning that’s for sure.,Feb 1| 2020,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611

$55.00 per day to park your vehicle at the hotel you are already buying a room at is a scam. The cost isn't easily discoverable and no one tells you anything at the desk| Once you leave you get a charge with no heads up. Its shady practice in my opinion. They also list the amenities as having indoor/outdoor pools too. Outdoor only. The location was good and the hotel was clean. views were bleak and lacking. would definitely find better next time.,Nov 29| 2019,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611

Im going to assume that due to late arrival we were given the last room which literally felt like a small box. When we booked and prepaid city view was noted. No city view| view of a parking garage instead. Room handles were dusty and toilet was slow to flush.The worse part was insulation was horrible. You had to keep the heater at 75° plus all night because once it was off our noses were so cold. We were in Chicago at 45° weather but didnt expect that. All in all if im sure we probably got the bad end of the stick but for my next stay in Chicago ill search for a diff hotel. Good parts were local to main shopping area and food and staff was very nice.,Nov 4| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611

First-rate hotel in the heart of downtown Chicago.  Reasonably priced considering its location| with convenient self-parking.  As a bonus| there's even a Starbucks in the lobby.  Our one disappointment (the reason we did not give it the highest rating) was the restaurant.  It seemed like an afterthought to the bar| and while the service was excellent| the menu had a very limited range of options.  If you stay here| check out other dining options within walking distance.,Oct 3| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
It was ok. The bathroom door was constant cranking sound which was disturbing my kid's sleep. When I talked to hotels.com associate and they called the hotel| they send maintenance at 12 AM for which I told to come on next morning. No one showed up after that and the room was having the same sound on the bathroom door. Outside voices were coming constantly during night. There was no microwave in the room which was a problem as I need to come downstairs every time I need to warm my kid's milk.Surprising part is there was no wifi in the room which is insane nowadays but they provided me the wifi password after I reached to hotels.com.,Oct 2| 2019,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
I felt rooms where in of a dire upgrade. Although centrally located I think you will pay a price for that| that being the noise from the street could easily be heard whilst staying in your room. Fire trucks| Ambulances| etc. which is within close proximity of the Hospital and medical district all night long every-night! Not sure if a room in a different area would suffice.,Oct 2| 2019,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611

Check in was supposed to be at 3:00. They told us it would be half an hour| when we checked back after half hour they said another half hour| so we checked back after an hour.

No one said anything because the girls had obviously been drinking . There families with small children and couples| etc nearly 25 people outside of them present.

1. we booked the property well in advance but was told there's no room for us when we arrived. I understand it's a late arrival situation (1AM) but they could have tried to contact me first (they have my phone and email) to see if I'm still coming. It seems like an oversold situation and my arriving late just means no room for me.2. we were sent to this alternative hotel a block away at 2AM in the morning. It's close but the condition is nowhere near Hilton standard.3. they promised us earliest check-in possible the next day (the staff mentioned 11AM or similar)| but I didn't get a room until almost 3PM. I repeatedly ask the front desk staff to call me or message me directly when the room is ready| but they never did| and I have to manually check with front desk again at 2:30pm to realize that my room is ready4. the room I got had construction noise going on for hours (can't work or rest or anything). Took me 3 or 4 phone calls to eventually switch us to a different room.Overall a terrible experience| mostly service-wise.

NOT this time| I arrived after a long flight only to find out they’re over booked & have to relocate me to another hotel. When I asked why I hadn’t been informed prior to my arrival I was told it’s just not a priority to do that. Even though I wasn’t staying there the staff was far from welcoming and seemed annoyed.

On arrival to the Doubletree my family and so arrived before check in time. We were told that our room was being cleaned and they would put a rush on it. Two hours later| even after the 3pm check in time| we were still sitting in the lobby. On arrival to the rooms one was very hot. There were no towels in any of the rooms. The housekeeper was in the hallway so we asked for towels. Her response| “call the front counter I don’t have any towels”| even though she had a cart full of towels. After calling it took over an hour to receive our towels. The next day| after exploring we came in ready to shower to prepare for dinner and again there were no towels in the room. So hot and sweaty we waited another hour before we were able to get some fresh towels. One of the cabinets in the bathroom was broken but since they were very slow respond we didn’t even waste our time reporting it. For the amount of money spent| there was no microwave available for guest use and the room where we thought the ice machine was located was full of supplies like they were doing construction. The staff was very nonchalant like the satisfaction of their guests didn’t make a difference. The only bright smile| was the head bellman.,Jul 24| 2019,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611

We had no issues with our stay at the DoubleTree.  We enjoyed the pool on the roof and liked the fact that they served Starbucks in the lobby.  The staff was incredibly helpful and polite and our room was very clean.,Jul 8| 2019,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
The location is good. The staffs are nice. The parking is expensive so use App to find better place to park. I stayed in 3rd floor so there was noise from the road during night. The bathroom has no fan to circulate hot air.,Jul 8| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611

Hotel food was extremely absurdly expensive no microwave no pool towels good thing we brought our own from home the people were nice that's the only thing that kept me happy pretty inconvenient if you're staying with your family pool area with slick with puddles I slipped and fell,Jul 8| 2019,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
The hotel was great the staff was underwhelming and attentive and long lines to check in check out with only one person behind the desk seem more interested in selling trips and getting people checked in and checked out of the hotel,Jul 7| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611

i didn't like that our room was between a noisy ice machine and the elevators which were noisy all night because they were constantly being used. There were also just thin sheets and blankets with no other extra blankets in the room| we weren't able to access the wifi at all on any of our devices without paying $9.95 per night which we weren't going to pay since we only brought a certain amount of money which we lost right away when we had to pay a $75 dollar deposit even after we spent almost $200 booking the room and an additional $55 just to park for the night which was absolutely ridiculously overpriced. Needless to say we are never staying here ever again and we had a horrible time here.,Apr 14| 2019,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611

The hotel is at a great location and within walkable distance to the magnificent mile| millennium park and navy pier. The staff was very nice| and overall the hotel had a very pleasing  atmosphere. The hotel room was clean and spacious. The only thing that bothered me was that there was no fan or vent in the bathroom. The huminnity after showering had caused the moisture to build up and you could tell there were spots on the ceiling that looked questionable. Not sure why you wouldn’t but an air system into a hotel bathroom.,Apr 2| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
Very clean and rooms are updated great service at the bar i hated paying so much for parking that was the only bad thing so if you going to stay here i suggest using public transportation or ride share,Apr 2| 2019,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611

Room was clean| however I had requested a king room and received 2 queen beds. I checked in early and asked them to text me when room was available and they didn’t. Also parking credit of $30 was not received. Was told I would get it on my receipt and we should just park in the garage. We did this and when we Checked out they said since we paid for the garage they can’t give us the credit. She did give us $18 credit from restaurant.,Feb 19| 2019,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
For the money paid it just wasn't right. My blinds were broken my Closet the door was brokenParking was terrible because I was only there for 30 minutes to check in and ended up paying $24. So I found a lot down the street where I was able to park for the whole weekend for $40. If you are a guest there your parking should be included Or discounted,Feb 19| 2019,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611

I paid extra when I booked this hotel room to get a room on a higher floor with a good view.  We were only put on the 16th floor in a room that over looked a dirty parking lot.  I would actually like my $20 - 30 dollars back that I paid for a room with a view.  The front entrance of the hotel was under construction| so there was no curb appeal and it was very hard to get dropped off or picked up from the front as space was very limited due to the construction.  The beds were a little to firm| as were the pillows so we couldn't wait to get home to our own beds.  The windows also leaked cold air| so we had to call down for extra blankets as it made our room to cold.,Feb 18| 2019,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611

Location of this hotel is great...walk to restaurants and shops easily. They are next to a grocery store where you can buy incidentals like water| soda| snacks even sandwiches and liquor.  Hotel is beautiful and staff are so nice| we enjoyed our stay.  We booked two rooms and were able to be next to each other which was nice of the hotel. I like the double queen room| very clean| nice big vanity in bathroom with shelves on the bottom for storage. View of city only problem the weather was real crappy and rainy.  The thing it does need is a coffee shop or something. Had to go across the street and down the block for quality coffee in the morning (missed breakfast). Hotel only has one restaurant/bar area which is on the first floor/ lobby area.   No coffee shop in hotel unfortunately but still liked it.  We went to Navy Pier (yes it was very very cold but it’s New Years Eve) Navy Pier is about a 7 or 8 block walk east from hotel but it went by quickly. Once inside Navy pier you warm up quickly.,Jan 6| 2019,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611

We came to the city to see the show at Chicago Shakespeare Theater on Dec. 26.  It coincided with a huge family Christmas event in the suburbs| so this was a perfect venue.  We were able to walk to all our destinations: the Mag Mile & Water Tower Place|  the restaurant and Navy Pier.

We came to the city to see the show at Chicago Shakespeare Theater on Dec. 26.  It coincided with a huge family Christmas event in the suburbs| so this was a perfect venue.

After walking around Chicago all day and night we wanted to come back to our room and shower and relax and watch television ....it was frustrating when i tried to listen to the television and couldn't hear it! You can't turn the volume up they have it set so that you can't hear over the traffic outside and then the shower barely had any pressure coming out from a handheld shower head! That's a little aggravating if you like to take long hot showers...all in all those are the only things i could complain about!

I stayed downtown at your hotel for the parade and your Hotel was clean and your people were very nice however I was quite disappointed with the fact there was no refrigerator in the room. I have a child that takes medication that requires refrigeration. I have stayed at Hotels that let’s just say weren’t up to your standards and they at least had refrigerators. I also wasn’t told that I would have to pay more money towards incidentals. Again that’s never happened to me before. I understand that 55.00 went towards parking however I couldn’t leave the garage before I paid so why did I need to pay in advance. If anything was wrong with the room when I left you had my card already on file. I felt that was quite unnecessary. Again it’s never happened to me before at any place I’ve stayed. I’ve stayed at better and at worst and never paid more than my original price that was quoted! Now I have a problem with Hotels.com which I plan on taking up with next. Don’t think I’d stay again.,Nov 19| 2018,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611

There is loud construction going on and only two elevators were working so if you're on a high floor like I was| it takes forever to go up and down. Also| it's annoying when hotels don't have free WiFi. Should be a given these days!!!,Oct 23| 2018,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
Location is good but the condition is poor| due ongoing construction. I checked in with given keys not working had to wait on the hallway front of my door for the security to recheck the keys and bring back  the new keys. Hustle specially  if you have time constrain with your daily plans. Second TV keep off and on due to poor/ni signal keep popping on the screen . I am not happy and satisfiedwith my stay.

Hotel was under renovation| almost no elevator service|dirty bathroom| rubbish in room.You did not tell me about the renovation| I would not have booked. I also could not find a telephone number so I could consult you as to what to do.,Oct 16| 2018,1,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
Everything with the Doubletree was good. Parking was $55 for less than 18 hours connected to the hotel. That was a bit extreme. No validation either.,Oct 15| 2018,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
There is loud construction going on and only two elevators were working so if you're on a high floor like I was| it takes forever to go up and down. Also| it's annoying when hotels don't have free WiFi. Should be a given these days!!!,Oct 23| 2018,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
Location is good but the condition is poor| due ongoing construction. I checked in with given keys not working had to wait on the hallway front of my door for the security to recheck the keys and bring back  the new keys. Hustle specially  if you have time constrain with your daily plans. Second TV keep off and on due to poor/ni signal keep popping on the screen . I am not happy and satisfiedwith my stay. Good thing i only stayed for one night,Oct 23| 2018,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611

When we got there the hotel was under construction.  We were then notified that the hotel employees union was on strike| so no room service and rooms would only be cleaned every other day.  They then offered ear plugs| because the employees on strike would start beating a drum loudly beginning at 7am.  Despite all this we still paid full price.,Oct 2| 2018,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611

The hotel was under construction.  Two elevators were working at the time making the waiting time to get to-and-from the room lengthy at times.  There were hotel protesters on the sidewalk in front of the hotel banging and shouting at 7:30ish in the morning every morning.  We were on the 13th floor and could hear them loud and clear.

The customer service was good and the room very comfortable. This is the our second time at this hotel. The room rate was at a great discount| so since we were staying in Chicago for 5 days| we took this deal. I think the hotel is doing a good job trying to minimize  the inconvenience for customers due to the construction work at the hotel. My only compliant is due to construction the elevator from the parking garage does not go to the lobby floor of the hotel. This was very  inconvenient and was hard due to my husband has health problems walking. You have to walk from the first floor of the parking garage to the front of the parking garage entry and walk down a hill to the hotel entry. We stayed there 4 nights| so it would have been nice to have self-parking fees discounted for this inconvenience to customers. We had a very nice view of the city| but the windows were very dirty| but I assume it was due to the construction on the hotel.

The hotel was dirty and fairly unsafe. Very disappointed that this is a Hilton Hotel. Staff was rude and I was supposed to have parking included in my stay and they said they had no idea what I was talking about and charged $110 on my card for parking. I will never stay here again.,Aug 27| 2018,2,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
Close proximity to all attractions.Convenient to conference,Aug 26| 2018,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
It is an older hotel and it does need updating.  Rooms were fine but dining and bar were very dark and need updating. Same with pool area,Aug 25| 2018,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611

Pretty nice,Aug 20| 2018,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
It's a good spot for doing stuff downtown. Only about a 20 min walk to the Navy Pier and fairly close to several really good restaurants. Staff was super helpful| and when I wanted to eat but the hotel restaurant was closed| not only did the doormen have a really good alternative but I got 20% off my bill with a coupon they gave me. Easy to get a taxi and close to the train station.,Aug 20| 2018,4,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
Everything went well with our stay we we had no complaints,Aug 20| 2018,5,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
Hotel pool was amazing for the summer months! Hotel was under construction so the fitness facility was not available and large portions were blocked off. Parking was expensive and no valet available. Not amenities like coffee available in lobby with was a bummer. Room was nice but bathroom not as clean and I prefer. Overall decent but some areas for improvement. Priced better than other similar hotels.,Aug 19| 2018,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611

Do not use the hotel’s parking garage. Do use nearby parking facilities as they are more convenient and cheaper than the hotel parking.The rooftop swimming pool is nice.,Aug 18| 2018,3,DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Magnificent Mile,300 E Ohio St| Chicago| IL| 60611
