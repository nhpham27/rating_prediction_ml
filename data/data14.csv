It was a decent price point. The service was ok. The area was excellent.,Aug 18| 2021,3,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
Amazing view of the One World Trade Center| memorial| and the bay,Aug 16| 2021,5,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
Dirty Dirty Dirty my room was soDirty that they had to change my room and that was dirty too. Glad the manager saw this. Will be requesting a full refund!!! Beautiful view and location but Filty,Aug 16| 2021,1,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
Amazing view. Staff was great and friendly,Aug 15| 2021,5,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
Well I booked a room with a bath separated from the shower but I got a connected bath and shower and the room wasn’t as I thought,Aug 15| 2021,2,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
Rooms need to be upgraded. Views beautiful,Aug 15| 2021,5,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
Great location.Property maintenance left some to be desired. Not all elevators working. Lobby closed.Refrigerators disconnected in roomsSome staff did not seem to be up to par with amenities.,Aug 14| 2021,4,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
I didn't like the staff. Specifically Claudine. Extremely rude and unprofessional. Will not be returning or recommending to anyone.,Aug 10| 2021,3,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
The carpet is full of stains. It’s outdated. The lobby had a bad smell.,Aug 10| 2021,2,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
I rented two Jr suits and they were both very deteriorated and dirty.I opened the small refrigerator inside the room and a horrible smell came out| aperently had being off for quite a while and probably wet inside.I gave my Hilton Honors number and the person at the front desk said he could not register those nights because I had made the reservation through Expedia and not through the Hilton web page.,Aug 9| 2021,1,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
Fridge and safe didn't work| otherwise very good stay,Aug 9| 2021,4,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
Overall| I'd rate this as a good hotel and would stay there again.  We did have a few issues| but it wasn't anything that were deal breakers.  It was advertised that parking was less than 1000 ft and when I spoke with the front desk verifying the parking situation| I was told yes| they have parking and it was $64 a night.  We got there| the parking deck beside the hotel was shut down and the gentleman working the front desk didn't know what the other associate was talking about.  We still found a deck a block and a half away after searching around.  Second issue| we booked a junior suite and when we went to check in were told they no longer had any suites available.  They wanted to comp us with two connecting room| but I explained it was a trip with my husband and a second room would just be wasteful.  They then instead gave us a high-rise room.  The views from the room were beautiful.  All in all| the rooms are a little dated| but even after the confusion with the parking and booking| we loved the location| loved the views and would book there again.,Aug 9| 2021,4,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
not clean at all| uncomfortable beds| bathroom dirty and dingy,Aug 9| 2021,1,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

Fabulous views of downtown NYC!,Aug 6| 2021,5,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
There was a soap box that was stuck to the ceiling of my shower l| looks like it has been there for a while. I don’t know how that goes unnoticed when making sure a room is cleaned for a new guest to stay in. Makes me sick to my stomach knowing that if that was left on the ceiling what else isn’t clean in the room. I have taken a picture of the box that is somehow stuck to the ceiling of the shower and if you want a picture of it i am more than happy to send it to whoever reaches out to me. That was really gross and I would like to get a refund for my room. I think the least to expect when staying at a hotel is a clean room and my room was not clean. Especially in times like now with covid I would think hotels were being more cautious about how clean the rooms are to avoid spreading but I guess your hotel isn’t. Please refund me for the room.,Aug 5| 2021,1,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

I had stayed here in the past| and it was a great hotel.  It seems that the hotel is long overdue for a makeover.   Due to Covid-19 the bar| restaurant| room service were all closed.  The hotel rooms need an update.  Currently| they are worn out.  Stained couches| peeling paint| broken handles| etc.   I think it does have the best views in Manhattan| but the facilities were worn and outdated,Aug 2| 2021,3,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
It is in a great location with great views.  Housekeeping service was excellent.  I marked "amenities" only as pleasing because of some restrictions still due to Covid.  Lots of good restaurants in the area with many shopping opportunities.  We had a great visit.,Jul 31| 2021,5,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

This hotel was amazing I have never been to New York and I’m so glad we picked a great location! Directly across from the World Trade Center memorial| east subway access and a safe and clean area. I will definitely be staying here again for my next visit thank you Millennium Hilton !,Jul 16| 2021,5,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

There was a roach in my room but they immediately gave me the option to switch my room and gave me a nicer view on the 40th floor. And the lady at the front desk was very nice about it and understanding. So I did appreciate that. I do wish the pool/spa or atleast the bar downstairs could be open. But I can understand given the covid restrictions. Overall it was a decent stay and the staff was polite.,Jul 7| 2021,4,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
Prefect location. Next to World Trade Center. Beautiful view from room. Pleasant and helpful staff.,Jul 7| 2021,5,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
Parking off site. No valet. No dining areas open yet in hotel. No little store with snacks available in hotel.room was nice. Had a great view of tower..room was clean.

Great location if you want to visit downtown and stay close to financial district. It has many good food options and is very close to The battery and south street seaport.,Jun 29| 2021,4,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
Rooms are very dated and very clean. Beds were uncomfortable.,Jun 28| 2021,3,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
I was very disappointed with the overall experience at this hotel. Very very bad service and cleanliness. They didn’t do my room service and said there was nothing they could do about it| the toilet was clogged.

GHETTO! Hotel rundown| interior of rooms beat up and outdated. Tv did not work| people staying near our room were extremely loud in late hours of night. So disappointed| surprised in quality of hotel for it being near 911 memorial. Would never stay here or recommend this hotel.,Jun 26| 2021,1,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
Stayed one night in June. Location was great - across the street from the Oculus and WTC memorial. The room was clean and quiet and the staff was friendly. None of the issues mentioned by other reviews. Also| there is a pop up outdoor beer garden across the street. Have a drink and a bite to eat under the new WTC 1,Jun 26| 2021,5,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
They failed to inform us that the holding fee was going to be $200. The room was small and the products in the bathroom looked used. The refrigerator was dirty and not in working conditions,Jun 25| 2021,3,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
Room 2011 was dirty| the sofa had stains. The carpet was filthy and stains on the bed spread. I have been waiting for a refund from hotels.com of $472.77 and I have been given the run around. Both experiences were upsetting and unprofessional. I will never do business again with either company,Jun 24| 2021,1,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
The rooms are old| and need a deep cleaning. If you’re traveling with a group you won’t have any place to sit| talk and eat.| they have no amenities available. I was attacked by a non hotel guest outside the hotel while trying to eat outside had we had some indoor seating it would’ve been avoided.

Very bang average hotel. Amazing location close to all the relevant subway stops to go uptown| etc.| which is I imagine this hotel is in business in the first place. They use "COVID" as an excuse to not clean rooms (you can only request cleaning once every three days)| and they don't even send people to clean the room once you request cleaning. I just happened to come across the cleaning crew in my hallway and they were extremely kind and went out of their way to clean my room... people downstairs are lacking the competency. Lamps in room were broken| and they didn't even provide a dedicated power strip or charging station next to the beds.Will stay elsewhere in close proximity next time. Cannot stand COVID being used as an excuse to not be transparent.,Jun 16| 2021,3,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
2 night stay in New York & was disappointed in the condition of the facility. The room was dusty| we requested blankets that we did not receive until we called a second time- the next day. Apparently rooms are only serviced per request (which is the opposite of what is customary) The fan was blowing hot air| had difficulty reaching front desk through the phone. I spoke to a woman at the front desk who was helpful but besides that this experience was not worth the $636 dollars.,Jun 15| 2021,2,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

The view from my suite was awesome. The room had a plenty of room and the hotel was close to the subway and major attractions. I didn't like that the room was outdated| sink was clogged up| the elevators needed maintenance| and there were absolute no amenities made available. I would definitely stay again simply because of the views of the Brooklyn Bridge and how close it is to the subway and major attractions.,Jun 11| 2021,4,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
I like that it was in a location that was walkable to most attractions however| the hotel is a little outdated. When I walked in the bathroom| it smelled like a wet mop. I figured out that they probably do not wash the shower curtains as they are cloth materials. I didn’t like that I had to pay an extra fee to have a refrigerator in my room. Also| the water pressure in the toilet was weak and could be stronger.,Jun 11| 2021,3,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

I asked for maintenance three times and no one ever went| in the hallway there was always a lot of garbage piled up| because there was nowhere to throw it away and in the three days that I was there they never cleaned it| the room was very dusty like they haven't cleaned for centuries.,May 27| 2021,3,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
After a long drive to this hotel| we were upset to find the parking lot was closed| after that we had to find off site parking and walk back with our luggage. The room was just OK but the carpet seem to have a blood or a big wine stain| the TV is extremely outdated| no WIFI| mini fridge didn’t work| the phones didn’t work. The pool was closed| as well as the convenient store. And to top it off| the service was awful| you have to show your room key before entering the hotel| the lady asking for room keys had a terrible attitude and was yelling at everyone. I’m confused how this hotel got 4 stars. Will never stay at a Hilton ever again.,May 25| 2021,1,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
This Hotel denied finding my reservation even when I provided my Expedia confirmation number| the staff didn’t show any interest in help solve the problem even when they saw I had a 1 year old baby with me that needed a place to rest.,Jun 1| 2021,1,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

The only thing that was great about this room what is the view everything else was terrible the room looked Like it was falling apart in my point of you but in reality the couch bed was dirty some of the cabinets in the room had chipped drawers| There were stains on the bed.,May 18| 2021,1,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
When I checked-in| I was informed that all building amenities were closed. TV in the room didn't work so they moved me to another room with a broken minifridge that had old orange juice in it. When I wanted to reheat my takeout| I called the front desk and was told they had no more working microwaves. The water pressure in the shower was also shockingly low. Had to go down multiple floors for a working ice machine.  The room was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. Overall disappointing for a 4-star Hilton.,May 18| 2021,2,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

Place is really nice| solid view and all that fun stuff. The mini fridge didn’t work and was broken looking inside. Not the end of the world. Would for sure recommend the place to friends and family.,May 9| 2021,4,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
Really terrific view of WTC and the oculus.  Excellent location with lots of food options and close to our FiDI office. Everyone who works at the hotel is very nice and accommodating.  The room didn’t have a fridge| which I really wanted for drinks etc since I was there a week.  I requested one and they brought it right up. Housekeeping only came a few times because of COVID but when I asked they offered to bring up fresh towels and linens.  Only complaints are that the room probably hasn’t been updated since 2001....smelled like long ago cigarettes and there were no convenient places to charge devices.  Also the Wi-Fi was bad| couldn’t do much work from the room.  All in all depending on the price I’d stay there again...but there are newer places nearby (without the view) that I’d try first.,May 8| 2021,3,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
The only good thing I liked about our room was that it was spacious. Everything else is pretty outdated. The cabinet which the refrigerator was in was missing it’s handled and we couldn’t even open it when we tired. The two little lights above the bed was missing the bulbs. The cooling system| the room was either too cold or too hot. I love the Hilton but this one was absolutely a disappointment.,May 8| 2021,3,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

I did not like anything about the place but the location. Room smells like weed. No real heat. No microwave or refrigerator. Old and outdated. No accommodations for no restaurant due to Covid. Most hotels. No spoon no forks no bag warmers. No tooth paste and much more. It was all bad including the beds. 750$ for 2/half days. I was better off booking a extended stay.

The parking garage was closed for renovations. AC wasn’t enabled - room was hot and could not be cooled. Phone was inoperable. TV was static and difficult to see. Had the run the fan on all not and did not get good sleep.  Bathroom was dirty.  No trash bags in the trash cans.

The best part of it was the tourist attraction the One world trade center the least I liked about it I booked the junior suite when I arrived in my room the carpet was disgusting the tables were not clean and the room had a nasty odor I called the front desk immediately and they gave me another sweet not an upgrade but a regular sweet like the one I had already booked after traveling 6 hours hours way too tired since we arrived late at night this room was also disgusting so I just bought stuff to clean it..I open a section that supposed to be a refrigerator I think and it was disgusting and it let out the worst odor in the room that I've ever smelled the tables had clearly dust that show through the glass and the window seals was scratched up shower area was not clean the next day a housekeeper came around and said do you need towels they never asked for the room to be cleaned so the day after I called down for housekeeping scheduled it for 10:15 I leave the room for 3 hours just to come back and the room was still dirty call down and let front desk know that housekeeping never came they made up 100 excuses why did the housekeeper came and said it was front desk and housekeeping fault they never told her to clean it being that this is a main attraction to this city this was the worst experience I've ever had my first time in New York City then they recommended the little man parking where the guys wore a new pair of my shoes and placed them back in the car the next day,Apr 6| 2021,2,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

When I arrived in my room I realized that the window was open all the way. I informed the concierge and he placed me in another room because the window was broke. What I didn’t like about my stay was the workout room. It was closed the whole weekend. They placed a “Closed for the weekend” sign on the door. I feel like that should be something they inform people about before they book. I missed out on 2 days of working out because I thought the hotel had a functioning gym. Also| no ice on my 25th floor room. Another sign posted said “30th floor for ice. I expected more from a Hilton; a Hilton in Manhattan! The only great part about my stay was the concierge he helped a lot. Recommended a bus tour and even gave me another mask when I left mines upstairs.

The hotel was BEAUTIFUL. I’ll always stay there when I visit New York. The only thing missing was a fridge. A lot of food went to waste because I had no place for it. I used the A/C vent to keep some things at least cool and a bucket of ice for some ice cream.

The place was clean and well kept| one problem we had was that the AC was kept at 78 degrees by default so sleeping underneath the semi comfortable covers without sweating was impossible.

The location is perfect if you are visiting the Oculus or One World Trade Center.  Very nice views.

The view is amazing| and the hotel is close to all of downtown| but the rooms need upgrading| and the property and rooms were not as clean as they should be--especially not in the age of COVID 19. The office chair in my room had stains on it| there were fingerprints under the glass part of the table| and fingerprints and a decent amount of dust on the windowsills. Fortunately I travel with disinfecting wipes and spray| so I squared things away. There were maskless guests in the lobby| and discarded masks in an elevator. We stayed here 2 years ago| and it's disappointing to see how much the property has declined.

This hotel is in SERIOUS need of investment and upgrade.  The room was dated| the bed was really uncomfortable| and there was little to no staff on site to assist with problems| which in my case were many.  The 25th floor stank of marijuana in the common areas| and it even wafted under the bedroom door and woke me up.  It was so intense. The check-in process was a total disaster - hoards of people and a single agent at the desk.  She was helpful and polite - no doubt - but the expectation that one person can check in a hundred people is ridiculous.Would not recommend this hotel.,Mar 17| 2021,1,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

Being in the heart of the City and observing microaggression's isn't an unusual combination. Now I understand that all hotels have policy's and regulations they have to follow| however you can't pick and choose who regulations and policy's apply to.

Room had window left open for ventilation which is understandable. Hotel heating system and thermostats are flawed and doesn't keep the room to proper temperatures.If you book a room and there is a vacant room next door| the window will be left open in that room and therefore the door to that connected room will constantly shake and be hit with strong winds.,Mar 16| 2021,3,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
We stayed 3 nights/2 days. The men in charge of receiving guests wasn’t friendly it all. He didn’t explain about the extra fees or the health screening we supposed to fill. When we or other people asked about it he was very rude. Besides that| the first day we received the cleaning service but not the second day.

It was pretty good the only thing people was making noises and smoking even in areas that they shouldn’t... but that’s under every personal behavior doesn’t go really under the hotel but the rest was pretty good under the limits we still live in now a days,Mar 15| 2021,4,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

This is the most disgusting “motel” I’ve ever been to. The rooms are outdated and the upkeep is deplorable. There were stains and remnants of past guests everywhere.,Mar 14| 2021,2,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

I didn’t like that almost everything I needed wasn’t available due to COVID. Paired with the outdated interior| out of service refrigerator| no microwaves| no amenities available| pool and gym closed.... the price wasn’t worth it whatsoever.

My room was dusty all around. I asked a guy downstairs in the lobby| not a doorman- i think he was a maintenance guy| for forks and knives. I came downstairs because room service instructed me to. I asked the guy and he said I’d have to leave the building because there were no forks or knives in the entire building. I repeated my question to make sure he understood and he still held his ground. I then asked the front desk clerk and immediately she went in the back room and got me utensils within seconds.

First room smelled like marijuana. Area around the elevators also smelled like marijuana. Hotel moved us. Second room had moldy shower walls (in the grout line). Asked maid to clean the mold. Returned to room and bathroom wall was still moldy.

730pm Check-in took about 30-40 mins| only one woman working and long line. The room looks nicer in the pictures. Walls are paper thin (heard distributing noises that I’m scarred for life now). We were woken up by very loud rattling of the vents| it goes on for about 20/30 mins| you sit in bed wide awake waiting until it stops so you can go back to sleep. Got the King Bed city view| the view was the best part. Will try another hotel next time.,Feb 21| 2021,3,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

Very attractive location right across the street from One World Trade Center (aka The Freedom Tower). You can tell this hotel was once very sophisticated and brought in all types of people. Unfortunately| it isn't maintained great anymore and you have a lot of sketchy people staying there. The weekend I was there there was a party in the next room until 2:00am and you could definitely smell weed. Not a terrible experience but it could surely use some upgrades.,Feb 17| 2021,4,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

the hotel to me gets a lot of guests because it is near the world  trade center. Thats the only reason I can see why. It us not modern looking like other hotels at all. They do not have a smart tv| the bathroom was so so weird I’ve never seen a toilet like that. When we got there the toilet was already clogged and when i noticed that the water just kept coming up someone had to come fix it.  The fridge did not work at all.

Sorry to say| I was disappointed in the hotel.  The room was clean but there was a cigarette smell in the room.  In addition| the website said there was parking however| when I checked in I was told| no parking| here's a car for parking but it is NOT affiliated with our hotel.  The agent didn't seem interested in being helpful to my family.  we waited for 15 minutes for an elevator when checking out.,Feb 15| 2021,3,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

The room smelled horrible because there was old food in the refrigerator.  The coffee maker still had coffee in it.  The whole experience was bad.,Feb 15| 2021,1,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

Sorry to say| I was disappointed in the hotel.  The room was clean but there was a cigarette smell in the room.  In addition| the website said there was parking however| when I checked in I was told| no parking| here's a car for parking but it is NOT affiliated with our hotel.  The agent didn't seem interested in being helpful to my family.  we waited for 15 minutes for an elevator when checking out.,Feb 15| 2021,3,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
This place is bad. Not clean and also the service was terrible. The elevators took forever and people were not six feet apart,Feb 15| 2021,1,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
We were not aware that this hotel  had NO PARKING AND WE HAD TO OAY $160 for parking that was crazy. Very unhappy. So much dust in the hotel rooms. Dust on the lamps. Not clean,Feb 15| 2021,2,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

Place is beautiful but the staff wasn’t friendly or looked like they wanted to be there. The phone system didn’t work and we had to walk down to the elevator and go to the lobby to ask questions. We bought a bottle of wine but couldn’t open it cause the didn’t have a corkscrew. Ask the front desk they answered with we are out or check your room,Feb 10| 2021,5,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

The hotel feels dilapidated and very outdated. The shower in our junior suite did not have a hand-held attachment| there was constant loud banging noise coming from outside the windows.

The view was beautiful. Only downfall i was told the day before my check in that it was $50 per night for accidental fee which would b refunded. Total $150 since i stayed 3 nights. I got there and was then told it was $75 per which came up to $225 smh. No food no pool no gym and the fridge in the room was broken. It was a quiet stay but dey need to really do better.,Feb 1| 2021,2,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
property was decent and the location is excellent but it was very crowded and there was almost always a line for the elevator. the heat in the room didn't work and we booked and paid for a king bed and got a queen. the view was decent though.,Feb 1| 2021,2,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

My Sunday last Sunday was not what I was expecting from a Hilton hotel. Carpet floor was smelly and outdated.  Heating system was malfunctioning and operating it was a hassle . It’s a shame to have a Hilton chaine with such old air control system.Sheets were stained and had hair . Hallways had a terrible odor and TV signal was mediocre . Overall my  experience was horrible that I ended up leaving and staying over with family . I’m asking you respectfully to refund me as I’m not planning on staying at this hotel again !!,Jan 18| 2021,1,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

Your basically paying for the view. It’s an older hotel. The window view is amazing. But there isn’t a fridge or even a microwave. Basic lights. Last hotel was half cheaper and it was really nice.

The entire staff was extremely rude and acted as though my being there was an inconvenience to them. All the amenities were closed| which I knew before I booked| however the staff told me an in-room microwave could be requested. When requested| they told me none were available and could not give me an ETA on when to expect one. The bathtub drain was clogged so every time I showered there was sitting water. As the staff was so rude I did not feel comfortable reporting the problem and asking to change rooms. The location and view itself were amazing| and the bed was comfortable however I would never stay here again due to the attitude of the entire staff.,Dec 17| 2020,2,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

This is a Hilton| folks.Be ashamed.1. Cars. No area designated for guest dropoff/check in. Was told to just "pull up" on Fulton or Church. That doesn't work. We drove around the block and finally just parking behind some cars in front of garage doors. Ultra inconvenient to have to call| drop off son to ask| and then call again (due to unclear instructions).2. Amenities. Well| don't look for a fridge or microwave in rooms. We had a Jr Suite. The only working ice machine was 9 floors above. They said that all fridges were decommissioned. Looks like a money saving event as less guests? Was told that a fridge could be had for $40. Nice. NY NY. Nickle dime for everything. Lucky no insulin or refrigerated meds.3. Carpets. Rooms are carpeted| but Nasty. No 5 second (even 1 sec) rule here. Torn or fraying. Grundgy.4.  Spare pullout sofa bed. Pretty bad. Thin mattress. No extra pillows (had to take 1 off the king). Not able to make frame flat.5.  Cleanliness. Probably clean. We had no COVID symptoms upon departure. Bathrooms were clean. One towel had what son said looked like blood| but probably wine stains.6.  Parking. Nonexistent. Parked off site via PandaParking (4 blks) as it was cheaper| but still valet| so $ to tip on dropoff and pickup.7.  Customer service. Had better front desk service at Holiday Inn| Comfort Suites| and Springhill. Felt like we were an inconvenience.8. View. Fantastic. Saving grace.

The Millennium Hilton New York Downtown was unique in terms of it’s location. Being by the WTC and all the local transit stations made it a prime real-estate for anyone visiting.  I was able to get around the city easily. In terms of my actual hotel experience it was subpar. The hotel staff and hotel services you could tell was downsized which was most likely due to covid. I think this negatively affect my stay a little. My friends hotel room wasn’t properly prepared| the bathroom wasn’t cleaned properly. The ice machine on the various floors weren’t functional. I had to travel to the 50th floor to get ice every time. Other than does little instances. The stay was average| I appreciate that I got a nice view from my room. I was very pleased with that. I think I can’t complain my stay was decent.,Dec 12| 2020,4,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
It says they have parking on site but do not and was not communicated until prompted. No fridge in room. No USB connections in room. Clean nice place. Quick check in and out. Would probably not stay there again.,Dec 12| 2020,3,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
My boyfriend and I wanted to celebrate our anniversary as a staycation (b/c of Covid) and I was so excited for this hotel because the woman I spoke to over the phone was so kind and accommodating| but when we showed up in person| the man at the front desk barely gave me the time of day. We got a corner room (junior king suite) with awesome windows| but as a whole the room looked old and not that well kept. The couch was stained in multiple places| the window ledge was made of light wood that was severely scratched| the floors didn't seemed vacuumed| and there was only one regular coffee packet and two decaf ones for our morning coffees. They did nothing special for our anniversary (which would have been extra work on their part| but would have made me forget all the other little things). Overall| I was not impressed and I don't plan on staying here again.,Dec 11| 2020,3,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

Parking was $54 dollars way too much ! It was also my birthday and I had an ice cream cake . Had to throw it out after eating 2 bites because the room didn’t have a fridge and I had to pay $30 if I wanted one . That’s just ridiculous.

Okay| so I decided to have a little staycation in the city for the weekend with my little ones. Upon arrival| the hotel is very polished looking| would definitely appeal to business clients/visitors. Front desk staff| was welcoming| quick and efficient. No complaints there. I was placed on the 32nd floor| and my room was close to the elevator. This is where things started to go left for me. 1. This is a non smoking facility| but the elevator and room area REEKED of smoke. And not like oh someone is smoking in their room| more like this is the SMOKING FLOOR. 2. Room| albeit clean is a bit dated. The floors were carpeted| so naturally there were a couple stains. My 5 year old naturally cops a squat on the floor as a kid| and I’m like ehh ehh| don’t sit don’t sit! 3. No fridge... 4. Bathroom| again clean| but dated. And I noticed there was a leak from the pipe when you turn on the cold water. I remember washing my sons face and I’m like how the hell did the floor get so wet?5. There’s no room service until 3 days into your stay in regards to Covid restrictions. Now I’m not the sharpest tool in the shed| but wouldn’t the pandemic ramp UP the cleaning??? I digress. 6. I must have been placed on the “popping” floor because there was quite a bit of traffic at night. Not the WORST| but I’m having a staycation| so I wanted to chill.7. I had to print a document for work| so I went to the business center| where there were 3 computer stations. 1 pc and 2 Macs| TBC,Nov 23| 2020,2,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

Okay| so I decided to have a little staycation in the city for the weekend with my little ones. Upon arrival| the hotel is very polished looking| would definitely appeal to business clients/visitors. Front desk staff| was welcoming| quick and efficient. No complaints there. I was placed on the 32nd floor| and my room was close to the elevator. This is where things started to go left for me. 1. This is a non smoking facility| but the elevator and room area REEKED of smoke. And not like oh someone is smoking in their room| more like this is the SMOKING FLOOR. 2. Room| albeit clean is a bit dated. The floors were carpeted| so naturally there were a couple stains. My 5 year old naturally cops a squat on the floor as a kid| and I’m like ehh ehh| don’t sit don’t sit! 3. No fridge... 4. Bathroom| again clean| but dated. And I noticed there was a leak from the pipe when you turn on the cold water. I remember washing my sons face and I’m like how the hell did the floor get so wet?5. There’s no room service until 3 days into your stay in regards to Covid restrictions. Now I’m not the sharpest tool in the shed| but wouldn’t the pandemic ramp UP the cleaning??? I digress. 6. I must have been placed on the “popping” floor because there was quite a bit of traffic at night. Not the WORST| but I’m having a staycation| so I wanted to chill.7. I had to print a document for work| so I went to the business center| where there were 3 computer stations. 1 pc and 2 Macs| TBC,Nov 23| 2020,2,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
There’s no control on the facility| staff horrible customer service from some of them not all of them and not happy with my room at all,Nov 22| 2020,1,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
Valet parking isn’t available on premise any more according to front desk staff not polite at all for visitors. Spend about an hour looking for parking. No amenities for visitors and the rooms are not fully clean drawers had hair in them. Very nice location but definitely will never stay here again.,Nov 22| 2020,3,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

First room that I checked into had a rug in the bathroom with a huge stain on it. Looked very dirty. My room was changed as soon as I mentioned it. Next room had great views however the shower stopped up everytime I toom a shower and the toilet made a noise every 30 mins. Otherwise room was cool. Pool and and gym not open.

It was directly across from WTC. So location was nice. The front desk staff are somewhat unfriendly and show a lack of professional courtesy. But even that doesn’t bother me to much. The bathtub kept backing up| but was eventually fixed. But what I found disgusting were sample shampoo and body lotions had tiny black hairs all on the inside cap. For some reason that made me gag to think they aren’t replaced after each guest.,Oct 26| 2020,2,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

Fantastic location. Right across the street from transportation hub and mall (The Oculus). One street over from the 9/11 memorial. Plenty of things to do and places to eat. Lots to see. The view is amazing. Unfortunately| due to COVID| amenities were closed at the hotel including the parking garage but we were lucky enough to find a garage one street over for the same price we would have paid to park at the hotel. Property was very clean. WILL DEFINITELY BOOK AGAIN.,Oct 26| 2020,5,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

Well first if I had a Junior suite I should’ve had a Refrigerator Microwave And two bathrooms in my suite  because on the website that’s what it says for a Junior suite...

It was directly across from WTC. So location was nice. The front desk staff are somewhat unfriendly and show a lack of professional courtesy. But even that doesn’t bother me to much. The bathtub kept backing up| but was eventually fixed. But what I found disgusting were sample shampoo and body lotions had tiny black hairs all on the inside cap. For some reason that made me gag to think they aren’t replaced after each guest.,Oct 26| 2020,2,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

The location of the hotel was great. There’s no complaints there. You’re literally in the middle of everything. However| I’ve never stayed at a hotel that doesn’t provide a fridge or microwave. None in the rooms or lobby. That’s just ridiculous. We had no where to store our drinks and no where to warm up food we bought. It was very inconvenient. And also to charge $50 deposit per day and not have any of the amenities come with it is just a rip off. I understand we’re still in the middle of a pandemic but what does that have to do with not having a fridge or microwave in the rooms. You cared more about taking those items out than your housekeepers doing their job to ensure a clean and safe environment.  The 4 days and 3 nights I was there no one cleaned or changed our sheets.,Oct 19| 2020,3,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

Due to COVID-19 there were no amenities and the parking garage was closed. It would have been very helpful to have known ahead of time about the parking garage.

All was fine - check in staff was competent. Room was good|  view of the Oculus and the Freedom Tower were amazing.  Covid had the streets fairly empty and the hotel amenities not in service.

Our room had amazing views of One World Trade aka The Freedom tower| One of the 9/11 memorial pools and the New Oculus and it was clean a bit small for it to be a king room but it was ok. The only complaint was that there was no hot water 2x out of the 3 days we stayed at the wrong time especially the day of check out when I wanted to shower before I left. The phones in the room were not working cause they wasnt charging correctly we couldnt get ours to work. The ice machines are not turned on| on every floor so you can only get ice from the designated floors in which a sign on the machine will tell you where to go. If you want to bypass the hotel tv I was able to hook up my firestick and watch my shows just paid for the premium wifi for streaming purposes $5.00 a day used it for 2 days. Other than the amenities not being available due to Covid. I would definitely book again. Hopefully the next time the hot water issue would be corrected.  I would also ask for my next room to not be so near the elevators and maybe next views of the Brooklyn and Mahattan bridges.,Oct 13| 2020,4,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

Our stay was amazing. During check in the first room that was assigned to us the tv was very staticky and very outdated so we decided to go back down and request a new room.

The hotel is very nice & the room was very comfortable.   We did| however| have a few issues.    After checking in rather late & taking all of our stuff to our room| the room we were given reeked of smoke.     I was very disappointed as I was tired & this is a 4 star hotel.   We had to go back to the front  desk & request another room|     Our 2nd room was very nice.     After settling in| I had to go find parking as there is no valet parking & the hotel’s garage is closed.    The front desk clerk told us of a parking garage.    After driving a few blocks| I realized it was just too far away!   I had to pull over & google another lot.     It was 8 blocks from the hotel.    I found out that the concierge could not store our bags the next day from 8:00-6:00 because they only allowed bags to be stored after check-out from 9:00-4:00.     The next morning my daughter & I had to walk 8 blocks lugging our things to our vehicle to store until we left the city.     We didn’t have time to find a cab.   We discovered a parking garage 2 blocks from the hotel that the front desk clerk did not tell us about.    We were so disappointed.      The hotel is very clean & quite nice.   However| due to COVID services are limited.    Staff needs to direct guests to the closet parking garage as there are no valet services.    It was so disappointing to be sent so far from the hotel.     Overall| the hotel is clean and in a great location.    However| customer service could have been much better.,Sep 26| 2020,3,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

The hotel is very nice & the room was very comfortable.   We did| however| have a few issues.    After checking in rather late & taking all of our stuff to our room| the room we were given reeked of smoke.     I was very disappointed as I was tired & this is a 4 star hotel.   We had to go back to the front  desk & request another room|     Our 2nd room was very nice.     After settling in| I had to go find parking as there is no valet parking & the hotel’s garage is closed.    The front desk clerk told us of a parking garage.    After driving a few blocks| I realized it was just too far away!   I had to pull over & google another lot.     It was 8 blocks from the hotel.    I found out that the concierge could not store our bags the next day from 8:00-6:00 because they only allowed bags to be stored after check-out from 9:00-4:00.     The next morning my daughter & I had to walk 8 blocks lugging our things to our vehicle to store until we left the city.     We didn’t have time to find a cab.   We discovered a parking garage 2 blocks from the hotel that the front desk clerk did not tell us about.    We were so disappointed.      The hotel is very clean & quite nice.   However| due to COVID services are limited.    Staff needs to direct guests to the closet parking garage as there are no valet services.    It was so disappointing to be sent so far from the hotel.     Overall| the hotel is clean and in a great location.    However| customer service could have been much better.,Sep 26| 2020,3,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

Very disappointing ..... with the biggest issue being lack of basic requirement of people wearing masks.  No one to monitor that situation| that I saw.  Concierge desk was usually unattended.  ???

Overall the stay was good. However| there no parking which is crazy for a hotel not to have parking. A guest must of complain about noise at 10:15pm while we were getting ready to go out on a Saturday night. The staff came up to issue a warning and if they came back again we could be evicted smh. This really blow our minds... we didn’t want to ruin the night so we left has we were doing so anyways.

I was really disappointed with my stay here. Due to COVID I expected the rooms to be extra clean but that was not the case. There was old food left in our mini fridge from the previous guests. Online it states that the rooms are left empty 72 hours between guests so this food was sitting in the mini fridge for over 3 days and smelled so bad. Our bathroom floor was also extremely dirty and there were urine stains around the toilet. We called the front desk to inform them and we were placed on a long hold and then they told us the the only thing they could do was to have someone come and remove the old food but no one was available to clean it. No one came to remove the food that night. It wasn’t until the next day when we put the sign on our door for house keeping that house keeping came and removed the food but didn’t clean the fridge or anything else in the room and we had to request new towels because we weren’t given any. Also I had booked a deluxe room but there was nothing deluxe about it. It was extremely small and it wasn’t worth the extra money for the deluxe. I have stayed at the other Millenium Hilton properties and this one was a huge disappointment.,Sep 8| 2020,2,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

I loved the view in my hotel room and the television quality was great! HBO movies available! The bad side of this hotel is - the water was brownish when I first turned it on| there was bugs crawling on the wall| the AC and refrigerator does not work. Also there is no microwave that I was able to use.,Sep 6| 2020,2,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

Everything was very clean! Bed was comfortable and sheets were nice. The hallway outside my room smelled like a garbage shoot so that was kind of gross. Staff wasn’t the nicest. We asked for a wine opener over the phone and waited 20 minutes. Finally I went down to the lobby and they said they’d send one up. Another 40 minutes went by and no wine opener. One day of our stay the elevators weren’t working. (Kind if problematic since we stayed on the 51st floor.) They allowed guests to use the employee/freight elevator which was nice. But I had walked right passed the front desk toward the Normal elevator and  Waited there for a good 10 minutes before I finally went to the front desk to ask if the elevators were working. Why didn’t anyone stop me from waiting for the elevator when I walked passed 2 employees at the front desk?The location however is amazing. Central to everything and every subway. Overall| I wouldn’t recommend this hotel to anyone staying more than 1 night.,Aug 14| 2020,3,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
I have been going to this hotel since 2013; granted| I have not been since late 2016| but this weekend in 2020 was awful: the room was grimy| moldy in the bathroom| paint chipped and peeling| wall paper with paint marks all over it| the chairs looked soiled| the room smelled of smoke| kids running around and banging things at 10:30pm--horrible experience.,Aug 11| 2020,2,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

Upon arriving the concierge energy was very degrading and rude. Then after waiting two to three hours after checkin because our room was not ready In time. They then put us in the disgusting room.

The view was amazing. The bed was comfortable and the soap they provide smelled awesome. The room was nice| but was not cleaned extremely thoroughly. I found a bottle cap on the floor near the bed| in the corner of the room near the dresser there was a dirty cotton ball and an old french fry (ew)| and the snacks were not replenished before I checked in... there was only a can of Pringles and a granola bar left. The TV quality was very poor for a Hilton hotel and the room smelled like cigarettes.,Feb 18| 2020,4,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

The location is of course| fantastic. However| we were disappointed by the room. It was in dire need of an upgrade; the carpet was dirty and stained| the curtains were also dirty and stained| and there was not refrigerator. The small refrigerator that was in the room was packed full of stuff to purchase and the refrigerator was not even cold. The pool was very small and there was no spa (Jacuzzi). Perhaps worst of all| there were only two full beds in the room that were barely suited to one person| and definitely not two adults. The mattresses were terrible! I could feel the springs. We would have liked to have ordered room service the evening we arrived because we were exhausted from travelling but they wanted $24 for one burger. I understand that room service is usually expensive but $24 for a burger? Also| the final bill included charges for three snacks/drinks that they claimed we took from the "refrigerator" or "mini-bar" (whatever they want to call it) that we had most definitely not taken. They didn't argue with us and they readily deducted the items from our final bill. I definitely would not recommend this hotel to any of my friends.,Jan 6| 2020,2,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

We planned a short stay in NY for New Years. Even though we drove it was nice to see it was right next to a train station. The staff was nice even though one doorman looked a bit irritated that night. We were upgraded to the junior suite which has the most amazing view of the world trade memorial. The best hotel I’ve stayed in while visiting NY thus far. Only no complementary breakfast.,Jan 4| 2020,5,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
As always| great to stay here; all the crew super friendly. I will stay again soon.,Jan 4| 2020,5,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
I book a one night stay for a personal “staycation” - with this in mind| I believe| is the reason why the front desk attendant placed me in a handicap accessible room. The view is beautiful but the bed and toilet are considerably low - I’m 5foot 9 so this is a bit uncomfortable. I’d like fair consideration for comfort being a hhonors member and an overall loyal patron. The duration of my stay should not come into consideration when placing a “fully callable” person in a room that is comparable to what was requested at booking.”,Jan 3| 2020,5,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

Location was convenient. They originally gave us a room that reeked of smoke| but worked to move us to another room. Suite was comfortable| though the beds were hard foam. Nice to have a pool and convenient to grab breakfast at the hotel restaurant. Seems place is going to need to be updated| but over clean and upkept. Staff was very professional and hospitable. I’d return,Nov 25| 2019,4,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
We had a beautiful room with a perfect view.   The hotel was clean and staff was efficient.   We didn't eat on site but I have no complaints and look forward to returning.  The location is excellent as well.,Nov 25| 2019,5,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

I am very upset with my stay at the Millennium Hilton downtown. The hot water did not work in our room so I had to take a cold shower. Additionally| the TV in the room was outdated and each channel was fuzzy—unwatchable. I booked the room with the purpose of making it to a law exam early in the morning on time and in the hopes of having a stress-free| good night’s sleep. However| I was very frustrated with my experience. The manager sought to alleviate the situation with free breakfast| however| I was still unable to have a relaxing evening in preparation for my exam because I was unable to unwind with a hot shower.,Nov 9| 2019,1,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

Did not get the room type I booked. Did not get bed size or bathroom. Box spring on bed not covered and had damage. Not as I expected. Had to be on the phone with Expedia for 1 and a half hours to try and resolve this after long day of work and I was tired. Did not get resolved. Expedia canceled the second night without my  request and I needed to find a room after another long day of work.

Stay was okay. The mini bar fridge was not working. It was dirty. We needed the fridge because we had some food that needed to be kept cold and when my husband called they were not very accommodative. They did eventually bring in a fridge. My thing is if you are going to charge $365 per night| you better have a clean working fridge.,Oct 18| 2019,3,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
I am so glad I chose this downtown location as it provided a brilliant starting off point for attractions (2 days with my 13 year old son in NYC). Attractive location| great local restaurants| Citi bikes and sub wait stop on street next door. Pool was a lovely tonic with a bright aspect but rather dated.Breakfast was good expensive.Lovely staff.,Oct 18| 2019,4,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

Hilton is garbage. I spent $2|000 at this dumpy hotel where I heard people through the walls| and then got Zero points for my stay b/c I booked through Expedia and not directly through Hilton. What made it worse is I was asked at check in if I wanted breakfast or extra points - even though they knew I booked through Expedia!!This hotel is a dump and the service is awful.,Oct 2| 2019,1,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

It was advertised as 2 Full beds. The beds were far smaller than Fulls. Closer to a Twin. Very uncomfortable. Also| one morning we were woken by a housekeeper screaming at a guest from the hallway for 20 minutes.,Sep 4| 2019,3,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
Great and iconic hotel right across from the WTC and oculus. We were on just the 12th floor and the views were great! Bed was so comfortable and room was spacious| which was pleasantly surprising to me because most hotel rooms I have stayed in while in NYC were tiny. Drawbacks: pool looks way better in pictures| it was quite small in person and reminded me of 3 star level hotel pools. Also apparently a bartender got nasty with my associate staying in my room but the hotel gave us free breakfast for the rest of the stay as compensation. All in all great stay| I will stay there again.,Sep 3| 2019,5,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

The room was spacious and surface level clean. There was a layer of dust in the TV stand| hard to miss. The carpets in the hallways and elevators are very dated| discolored. The issue I had with my room was noise. I could hear when the rooms either side of mine flushed their toilets. It was very disruptive. Location is great though| I'd say fairly priced due to that point. Great view!,Sep 3| 2019,4,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
Fantastic location and spitting-distance to Fulton Plaza and all the transit it entails; the WTC location didn't make it way too busy| either| even though it was a Labour Day weekend. However| the washroom toilet emitted a constant sound| the fridge wasn't particularly cold| and staff were not helpful when it came to WiFi access or our hotel keycards| which consistently failed to work| including one morning at 5am that required multiple trips to the desk.,Sep 3| 2019,3,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

All in all great stay| I will stay there again.,Sep 3| 2019,5,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

The room was spacious and surface level clean. There was a layer of dust in the TV stand| hard to miss. The carpets in the hallways and elevators are very dated| discolored. The issue I had with my room was noise. I could hear when the rooms either side of mine flushed their toilets. It was very disruptive. Location is great though| I'd say fairly priced due to that point. Great view!,Sep 3| 2019,4,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
Fantastic location and spitting-distance to Fulton Plaza and all the transit it entails; the WTC location didn't make it way too busy| either| even though it was a Labour Day weekend. However| the washroom toilet emitted a constant sound| the fridge wasn't particularly cold| and staff were not helpful when it came to WiFi access or our hotel keycards| which consistently failed to work| including one morning at 5am that required multiple trips to the desk.,Sep 3| 2019,3,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

The view from my room was beautiful| overall the experience was very good. I would recommend this hotel.,Sep 7| 2019,4,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
The staff was very nice. The elevators were pretty scary and the hotel was a bit outdated. But the view was amazing definitely my favorite part of the weekend.,Sep 7| 2019,4,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
The location was great for my trip| but there were huge dust bunnies on the tv “cabinet|” housekeeping had to come remove a large bug| my A/C broke| and there was a piece of plastic in my overpriced sandwich. Overall| I was not impressed.,Sep 4| 2019,2,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
It was advertised as 2 Full beds. The beds were far smaller than Fulls. Closer to a Twin. Very uncomfortable. Also| one morning we were woken by a housekeeper screaming at a guest from the hallway for 20 minutes.,Sep 4| 2019,3,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
Great and iconic hotel right across from the WTC and oculus. We were on just the 12th floor and the views were great! Bed was so comfortable and room was spacious| which was pleasantly surprising to me because most hotel rooms I have stayed in while in NYC were tiny. Drawbacks: pool looks way better in pictures| it was quite small in person and reminded me of 3 star level hotel pools. Also apparently a bartender got nasty with my associate staying in my room but the hotel gave us free breakfast for the rest of the stay as compensation.

Nice hotel| great views and central location. Beware the mini-fridge: it's a you touch it| you buy it deal. Would have been nice to have an empty fridge instead to store a few late night snacks. But!

The hotel building was so beautiful! The view from our hotel room was amazing. Staff was very friendly! We had a few minor issues| such as having to get some of the pillow cases and sheets changed from certain stains. I would suggest the hotel upgrading on their televisions.

I enjoyed the view and the closeness to the Oculus and the different train stations. The only issue that I had was the refrigerators in the room were unplugged and we're not working and they smelled because of them not being plugged in. They said there was a rental fee involved if you wanted the refrigerator. It did not make sense to me that they were a mini bar and nothing was kept cold. I needed the refrigeration for medication and it took a while for them to come up and just plug it in. It was too complicated for my taste.,Jul 8| 2019,4,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

It was supposed to be a Mommy & Me trip. When your 7yr old says| “Mommy this the worst room ever!”| you know it’s bad. She’s not even a big traveler and nor doesn’t keep her own room clean.lol The room was VERY small with an odor. When I opened what I thought was a refrigerator| turned out to be a minibar that appeared old and smelled like mildew. Our television didn’t so I had to let my daughter watch her shows on my phone. Thank goodness for the other attractions in the city to keep her busy. The restaurant was not good at all.

The price was right| thanks to Hotel.com| but the internet didn't work| the thermostat was not great and the minibar snacks were depleted. There’s no place to get a snack. At 9 pm| the front desk directed me to the Walgreens over a block away. Room Service is ridiculously expensive. I was going to treat myself to a bowl of ice cream.

The bed was very uncomfortable| the fridge was broken| not alot of information listed about the amenities in the hotel| had to call the front desk for the wifi password. We did have wonderful view from the 29th floor. The staff was very helpful and kind.,May 28| 2019,3,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
Excellent view of the Oculus| Freedom Tower and Hudson River. Location is great| especially since it’s close to many subway lines. My kids loved the big indoor pool| which is a real luxury for a Manhattan hotel. Room was spacious but some details were missed. The sofa bed was dated and didn’t look very clean. The sheets were already on the sofa bed when we opened it up| complete with a bloodstain on the top sheet! Carpets could also do with a thorough cleaning. Overall| a great stay| but for the price of a junior suite| I would expect clean bedding and carpets.,May 27| 2019,4,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

We liked the fact that it is so close to the places we wanted to see and visit . I would expect a Hilton to be clean . Our room carpet appeared dirty with lots of stains . The bathroom fan did not work and the floor was not in great shape either . The room just was shabby and I feel not very clean. This was a sold out week so changing rooms was not an option,May 27| 2019,3,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

Absolutely gorgeous view I was on the 32nd floor and it was stunning! Room was alittle small but definitely felt roomy and at home.

Easy to find| gorgeous view| and perfect location. Was able to walk to get food and see a lot of different sites.

Check in process was good| my 8 year old wanted the highest floor possible| so I asked and we were put on the 47th floor overlooking the Oculus and WTC Memorial.  It was a breathtaking view!  The room was clean| neat and comfortable.  I was however unhappy with one thing. I booked a 1 hour massage.  Per the directions on the website| I called a few hours in advance. The gentleman was very nice and was able to call back in moments and confirm that indeed the therapist would be ready for me at 330pm. I showed up at the appointed time and honestly had a fantastic massage and was so relaxed! It was however| completely ruined because as I came out| I asked the therapist where to sign (assuming I could put this on my room bill).  It was then that I was told that I was to pay the therapist directly and that I should have been told that when I booked. Moreover| they only take CASH.  So everyone has 100 cash on them all the time| right? No| I didn't.  So after my super relaxing massage| I am in a panic and have to go to my room get an ATM card| I go to the front desk and ask where the ATM is - THE CLOSEST IS A BLOCK AWAY.... After my relaxing massage| I had to walk a block| get sweaty with the massage oil clogging my pores| pay $3 foreign ATM Fee to pay the massage therapist.  None of this was her fault and I still gave her a tip. I didn't go to the front desk to complain because I just didn't want to worry with it - I wanted to go back to relaxing.,Apr 29| 2019,4,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

BEWARE.  The Millennium Hilton Downtown REGULARLY oversells its rooms.  I arrived at 7am to check in and was told that there were no clean rooms available at that time.  I stored my luggage as requested and left for my client.  Upon returning at 10:45 pm| I was told that they were oversold -- in fact| that they KNEW they were oversold at 7am (but didn't tell me) -- and 'offered" to send me to one of their much lower-class sister hotels 15 minutes away.  The worst part (besides not being able to sleep after an exhausting day) -- the desk manager approached her offer as if it fully rectified the situation.  It was the first and last time| I'll stay at the hotel.

Service from the concierge and front desk was very rude in 3 instances during our interactions. Upon check in| the lady didn’t bother talking to us and just demanded our credit card and ID.

The pool is in desperate need chlorine and repairs. The mirror walls was dirty and smudged looked very nasty. My job is physically demanding was looking forward to using the steam room but was unable to because the steam room was out of order the main reason why I picked this hotel for the pool and steam room. Had two rooms next to each other one room had a tv that was very poor and snowy and the shower head was terrible. One room was clearly better than the other even though they were right next to each other. This is a famous hotel and for the price per night it should be in better shape! I wanted to have breakfast at the hotel $28 is over the top for a continental breakfast didn't bother looking at the lunch and dinner menu. I paid $6.00 for a can a coke and the sad thing is that the wholesale cost of a can of coke is $0.42| enough said. I love staying at hotels and love spending money at hotels and the only money I spent at this hotel was the $6.00 for the can of coke.,Apr 7| 2019,4,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

With subway stations right outside the front door we had access to the entire city. As with any older hotel| there were minimal signs of wear and tear but the room was clean and modern and the staff was attentive and helpful. One thing of note is that the AC was not on since it was winter and they do not make it available in any rooms so it got a bit warm and stuffy. The front desk clerk said the only option was to have someone come up and open the windows which we did not want to do.

Great stay at Millennium Hilton Downtown.

I stayed for four nights and the room was cleaned every day as though I was a new guest checking in. Concierge and reception staff were very friendly. The only minor downsides were expensive WiFi| very old and pixelated television (not HD)| and not allowing to accumulate Hilton Honors points when booking through a 3rd party (booking.com was significantly cheaper for the same hotel on day of booking).Overall a great stay and would definitely stay again when next in the city for business.,Mar 19| 2019,5,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

Room was clean.  Larger than other nyc properties I have stayed in.   Had a view of 1wtc can’t beat that.  Minibar was reasonably priced for a hotel minibar.

Great views & value on rooms on new Years day.  due to the mass exodus that day| we couldn't get into our rooms well past the normal check in time| thus spent way to much time ( 2+ hours) waiting in the lobby to get in our room. we waited because the staff keep telling us that the room would in ready in a few minutes.....,Mar 5| 2019,4,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

I chose this hotel since my brother would be staying and touring NYC for two nights only.  The hotel needed to be the most accessible| close to the best NYC attractions with a very competitive rate!  And these are all true for the Millenium Hotel in downtown.  The hotel is located in front of the Oculus| few steps from the 9/11 Memorial and walking distance to the Battery Park.  I also got very good rate during our stay!The lobby is nice with bar at the corner.  We did not get a chance to check the other facilities.  The room is a good size| we upgraded to two double beds.  It a little bit outdated and there were showing of wear and tear in the room itself.  There was also a funny smell in the room which we were able to resolve by spraying the room with our perfume. They told my brother it’s the bathroom cleaner scent.  All in all it was a pleasant stay aside from the smell.  The location is great!  I will consider to stay again in th future.,Aug 19| 2018,4,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

Por algún motivo un día no realizaron la limpieza del la habitación| por lo que tuvimos que estar pidiendo que la realizarán el resto de los días. Por algún motivo la camarista nos tocaba a las 8 am para hacer la habitación| evidentemente a esa hora aun no estábamos listos para salir y pareciera que esta situación le molestaba  y decidió no hacer más la limpieza de habitación.Pero en aun así la pasamos muy bien.,May 15| 2021,4,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007

Por ser um hotel da rede Hilton deixa muito a desejar. A única vantagem é a localização e pelo fato de ser um edifício alto ficamos no 53 andar vista linda.Fácil acesso ao metro. Muitas opções de linhas em frente ao hotel.No entanto a limpeza deixa a desejar muita poeira| o quarto o tamanho é bom no entanto antigo não tem tomadas próximas às cabeceiras das camas. Precisa de uma renovação.Encontramos durante a estadia peças de roupas de outros hospedes atrás das cortinas.A estadia de 7 dias neste hotel foi parte de uma viagem de 18 dias nos Eua todos os hoteis reservados pelo hoteis.com e este foi o que menos me agradou.

Ikke det beste hotellet på rengjøring og standard. Ikke som på bildene. Åpnet kjøleskapet og her var det muggete og luktet oppkast. Sa ifra 3 ganger om det men ikke noe ble gjort. Passer ikke for de med astma da det er tepoe på rommet som ikke er godt rengjort. Fikk ikke noe info om fasiliteter på hotellet. Det eneste som var positivt er beliggenheten som er helt topp. Men hadde da valgt et annet hotell i området for en ny tur. Dette trenger oppdatering på mye.,Feb 23| 2019,1,Millennium Hilton New York Downtown,55 Church Street| New York| NY| 10007
