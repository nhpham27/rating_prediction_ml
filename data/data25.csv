The hotel is convenient to the convention center| but it needs updating. The mirror in my bathroom was rusted| the sink has a lot of scratches| the doors were all scratched| and there was a weird slope in the room and halls. It was clean enough| but not stellar. I'm hoping it's due to the COVID times and lower staff,Aug 19| 2021,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
It was okay. The carpet wasn’t clean when we checked in and the next day around 0900 somebody was hammering already and woke up my kids.,Aug 19| 2021,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Great stay from start to finish!  Great staff| eager to help| great bed and excellent mattress!  I could not complain about anything if I tried!,Aug 17| 2021,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Nice and cozy hotel| everything was clean| great customer service.,Aug 16| 2021,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Everything needed was within a rock's throw away,Aug 13| 2021,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
One of the check in staff was rude and abrupt. Both check in employees evidently didn’t know how to check in or find third party bookings. The guy who checked me in bothered to investigate and find out but it was evident had he not done so other customers would not have been checked in. Rude. Colored the experience as first point of contact.,Aug 13| 2021,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
We liked over looking the beach,Aug 13| 2021,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
It was a wonderful hotel overall! The only thing that was negative was that all of the food onsite was overpriced- other than that the room was great| bed and pillows were comfortable| and the staff were all really nice!,Aug 12| 2021,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
We have stayed here several times over the years| and we were looking forward to returning. But they are beginning to have some maintenance issues. Several hotels in the area are upgrading and modernizing| and it may be time for this place to consider it. We had plumbing and moisture issues in the bathroom. There was also very lite cleaning in the room| made the bed and that's about it. The biggest issues were the sink was clogged| and there were bubbles under the wallpaper in the bathroom and its obvious there was probably moisture trapped under it. Its not surprising since there is no vent in the bathroom and it gets very warm and moist in the rooms after showers. There was also stains in on the carpet| and walls| and our bed was noisy as hell. There were also some interesting stains in the bathroom...we almost complained shortly after checking in but we just wanted to unwind and go to Disneyland. We will likely stay somewhere else next time.,Aug 12| 2021,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Location perfect ! Close to the parks and lots of restaurants and stores walking distance - staff super friendly- we would stay here again - thank you !,Aug 12| 2021,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
The room located on the pool deck was great,Aug 11| 2021,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
I was honestly expecting more from a Hilton| especially one right next to the Convention Center. Pros: Nice lobby. Huge gym. Splash play area for kids. Starbucks downstairs. Cons: Parking is $24 a night and is not included. My room had several issues: a leaking bathtub faucet| the dresser drawers did not stay closed| horrible pillows| an alarm clock with a loud non-adjustable beep| a towel rack inside of the shower| and a loud sliding bathroom door. Also the walls were thin and we could almost everything going on in the room next to us. We were woken up in the morning by an unidentified tapping sound on the window which was not coming from our room. The indoor pool was closed and there was no notification about this on the website. This was the main reason we picked this hotel to begin with.,Aug 11| 2021,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Nice place,Aug 10| 2021,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
We were blessed with a room at the very far end on the 12th floor. It gave us extra sitting room| which was perfect for my girls! We absolutely LOVE this hotel and can't wait to go back!!!,Aug 10| 2021,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Over priced| out dated| mold in shower| was moved right away next room shower handles ready to fall off... below expectations for price,Aug 9| 2021,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Overall was convenient to walk to Disney (about a 20 min walk). Room was spacious and we had a great view of the theme parks. One negative was the room bathroom size| it could only accommodate one person at a time; while this worked for us as a couple| it would definitely be challenging for a small family who may have to get children ready.,Aug 9| 2021,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
The hotel has many amenities in the lobby. It’s close to Disneyland but it is not impressive. I stayed there about 10 years ago and thought it was very nice. Now it seems like it’s due for some updates in the rooms. Overall it was clean and fine for the night.,Aug 9| 2021,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
This place is gross| old and out of date. Stay at the Marriott across the convention drive or anywhere else. I was so disappointed in the hotel itself| the food and the very small| dirty looking pool. Never again.,Aug 9| 2021,1,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Property is close to the parks. Lobby is nice| staff is nice. Room was in bad shape in need of updating. The bathroom toilet was loose. The shower drain took long to drain. The vending machine on my floor I pressed to buy water bottles and coke would come out instead.,Aug 9| 2021,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Room was dirty and furniture was old and damage,Aug 9| 2021,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
When we arrived to our room the refrigerator did not work and the sink wouldn’t drain. We called the front desk immediately and was upgraded to to a poolside view. The staff was friendly .,Aug 9| 2021,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Ive stayed here each summer for many years| never had a problem. This year was down right disgusting. The backroom door handle was broken| the bath tub plug was missing. They never changed the sheets| only made the bed. Left dirty cups on the counter| left dirty towel on the ground. Didnt always replace the bag to get ice. Called for more towels they took a hour to come up.,Aug 8| 2021,1,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
The hotel has a lot of amenities that are great.  We have stayed twice once in the spring and this time in the summer:  the spring visit was great.  However the summer visit wasn’t so good.  The pool was rediculous.   The kids area was over capacity|  kids were hitting other kids| we only stayed at the pool for 30 minutes because it was out of control.  The safe in our room got jammed 2 times and we had to get security to open it up.  On the last security visit the said the batteries were dead but that we had to wait until the following day to get new ones.  Our toilet was broken and wouldn’t flush.  Maintenance had to come up to replace parts inside the toilet.  The drawers on the tv stand wouldn’t stay closed. If you closed them they would open back up.  I will say the gym was great| older equipment but had a lot to offer.  I don’t leave reviews however I thought our experience was worth it.  We have stayed at other Hilton properties and been very satisfied| however that was not the case at this hotel.,Aug 8| 2021,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

A very lovely hotel with respectful| friendly staff. Great pool and water park for kids. We felt safe staying here. There is an actual starbucks in the hotel| ling lines but so convinient. The food court and restaurants were closed during our stay| so we were not able to order food services. On the 5th floor there is a pool and grill restaurant/bar with lounging available while kids play in the water park.

If this property wasn’t easy walking distance to Disney I would have rated it lower. Typical conference hotel with massive facilities and a ton of people running around. We were hopeful given the star rating it would be nicer. Room was small| old| dark and kind of dingy. The bathrooms were tiny and could barely fit a second person. The elevator set up was a challenge (even with 2 full banks of them) for 2 adults and a double stroller| as they they were filled morning| noon and night and would take multiple attempts to get one that you could fit into. For the price| we should have checked out the Westin instead| but I was sold on the breakfast included rate. The breakfast included rate is a $60 credit daily - not explained in the booking process - and a meal per person in their restaurant is $20. For a family of 4| it’s at least $80. You’ve officially lost your “free breakfast.,Jul 31| 2021,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
I love the room it was nice and spacious for my family the outside pool was nice my kids love it. The Fitness center was ok i only say ok because the Basketball court and other gym and indoor pool was closed.

The rooms were really clean and our kids had a great time in the pool. When we booked our rooms we purchased a breakfast buffet. Upon arrival we were told there was no buffet and we would be given a credit for food and beverages. There was only 1 restaurant and starbucks  open. The lines to these businesses were really long and were imposible to use our credit. If the buffet is not available why do they make it an option for purchase when booking.  The indoor pool was also closed,Jul 30| 2021,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

The lines to these businesses were really long and were imposible to use our credit. If the buffet is not available why do they make it an option for purchase when booking.  The indoor pool was also closed,Jul 30| 2021,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

The staff was friendly| and the hotel services were good but the rooms do not match what the lobby indicate. The lobby seems high end| but the rooms are not high end. The price for the rooms do not include parking. They also do not offer a shuttle to Disney| it’s actually the bus system that has a direct route to Disney from the hotel. Not a bad location since there is plenty of food options with in walking distance| but a bit pricey,Jul 27| 2021,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Once we got up to our room we noticed the clean and fresh room. We dined at the restaurant on the first floor and it was delicious.

Rug was really dirty with some sticky spots that stuck to your foot. AC unit was loud and came on repeatedly throughout the night even when thermostat was up or off! Really long hallways & no luggage carts available without a bell hop. Parking is OK at $24/day| but Wifi costs $12/day! Toilet clogged quickly & took hours to get it plunged. No microwave| which is odd for this type of hotel. They need a serious remodel/cleaning & a policy review.,Jul 18| 2021,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
The hotel’s lobby was very clean| all the workers were very friendly. The hotels location was great| right next to Disneyland. In addition| I opted for the Valet service| the valet were always out with my car in under 5 minutes| sometimes closer to 2 minutes and very friendly as well. I requested a room with a view of Disneyland| for an added cost of course| and was placed on the top level with a direct view of Disney| this made it perfect for watching the fireworks come night time.

I’ll start by saying that I appreciate the fact that this hotel is within walking distance of Disneyland| restaurants| and stores. That was great! But that could be said about the majority of hotels in Anaheim. Now to the criticism.....I must say that I am disappointed with the condition of this Hilton property. The room was outdated. The door handle into the bathroom was broken and it was quite clear nobody made a good attempt to repair it in several years. There was a weird leak coming from the roof of the shower. There was another leak in the hallway that was not repaired the entire time of my stay. Instead| they laid towels on the floor. Very tacky. For this to be a large Hilton property| I expected more. They should close the hotel for remodeling just like the nearby Sheraton.,Jul 17| 2021,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

The hotel is beautiful. My complaint is the parking attendant. I had forgotten my room key in the room when I went to check out (my fault) and had checked out via their text service. When I went to leave the parking lot and realized I needed my key| I pushed the button to speak to staff. I told them what happened and they didn't say "hold on a minute" or anything like that| they just hung up on me. I wasn't quite sure what was happening so after a minute I called again. That's when Cynthia was walking up and said she was "I'm already here". Her demeanor was cold and aggressive. She told me I had to go back and get the key or show a receipt. I figured there must be another way| so I showed her my text message for check-out and my room number| but she said she couldn't take it. I happened to check my email and had an emailed receipt from Hilton and she said she already had it. She did let me go after a little wait| but she was so rude about it. It really bothered me since I paid a lot to stay the night| and it was my birthday| so it started my day off negative. There was really no need for her attitude| there was no line behind me| and I was polite to her. I hope this is addressed. She does not seem like she belongs working at a nice hotel.,Jul 16| 2021,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
I will not stay in this property again - partly my fault and partly theirs. Partly my fault because I realized I just don't like resorts - too far to get to the rooms| too far to get to parking| easy to get lost| etc. I just prefer simpler accommodations. What was their fault was the inability to fix the fridge in my room - I either called or talked to someone three times and nothing was ever done. Every time they assured me someone would come look at it and nothing happened - not even a call or follow-up to see if I was happy. I'd never stayed in a Hilton before and thought the name was synonymous with impeccable standards. My mistake.,Jul 16| 2021,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

I figured there must be another way| so I showed her my text message for check-out and my room number| but she said she couldn't take it. I happened to check my email and had an emailed receipt from Hilton and she said she already had it. She did let me go after a little wait| but she was so rude about it. It really bothered me since I paid a lot to stay the night| and it was my birthday| so it started my day off negative. There was really no need for her attitude| there was no line behind me| and I was polite to her. I hope this is addressed. She does not seem like she belongs working at a nice hotel.,Jul 16| 2021,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
I will not stay in this property again - partly my fault and partly theirs. Partly my fault because I realized I just don't like resorts - too far to get to the rooms| too far to get to parking| easy to get lost| etc. I just prefer simpler accommodations. What was their fault was the inability to fix the fridge in my room - I either called or talked to someone three times and nothing was ever done. Every time they assured me someone would come look at it and nothing happened - not even a call or follow-up to see if I was happy. I'd never stayed in a Hilton before and thought the name was synonymous with impeccable standards. My mistake.,Jul 16| 2021,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Great hotel.  It is super busy with Disney but we didn’t have a problem.  We had a room where we could see the fireworks from Disney.  The pool was warm with a play area for the kids.  Would stay there again,Jul 16| 2021,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Staff is super nice. 15 minute walk with kids. Kind of far my kids were super tired after spending all day at Disney. The hotel needs a good renovation. First room we got had a leak in the bathroom sink| called downstairs n quickly got moved to another room. I would not stayed here again. Closer walk to Disneyland next time.,Jul 15| 2021,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

There is a shuttle right across the street for Disneyland.. If it had been cooler we would have walked the 15-20 min| but it was so hot outside. The Hotel was nice and air conditioned. Starbucks on site. Many of the food options were closed but still had the restaurant and used Doordash to deliver from local.  It was clean and the pool was wonderful| nice pool/play area for little kids. Felt very safe traveling with my 10 year old alone.,Jul 13| 2021,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
I was very disappointed our phone and tv was not working. The bathroom tub has molded mildew on the lining.  The room smelled musty And the refrigerator had a ice as thick as 3inches of ice .  I actually took pictures of our hotel room.. We travel do much that this is the first time I have been upset..the amount of money that I paid for a good hotel . Hilton is not worth the money I paid for.,Jul 13| 2021,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

I booked this hotel because it had great ratings and looked nice. We arrived at about 7:30 pm to check in to valet and was told to come back in 4 hrs or use self parking. Once we got our room the fridge was unplugged and we had to pull it out from a cabinet to connect it.  Fast forward to bedtime| the bathroom has a beeping sound that doesnt stop no matter what we did and the air vents in the room rattled so bad we got no sleep! Such a horrible experience|  it was so late ans we were already unpacked and tired I didnt want to go down|stand in the long elevator and check in lines and ask for another room,Jul 13| 2021,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Good hotel! Enjoyed our stay. Daily room service is back and we loved getting our beds made and fresh towels. Beds were comfy. Great location by convention center and dining places. On the down side| I could hear every word the people above us said. Not a big deal most of the time except in the early morning. Parking was close and we had easy access but was expensive.

Let me start by saying I struggled to give it 3 stars. So I would like to break my review down (stars in parenthesis): The rooms is what brought the star rating down for me. So when you walk into the hotel it looks amazing. It is large| looks trendy. Bar area is cute. Decent amount of elevators. And about a 1/2-3/4 mile walk to Disney which isn't bad| except in the evening. (4)BUT... the ambience you see in the lobby does not match the room. The rooms are old and outdated. The carpet smells. For a Hilton I expect them to do better and upgrade those rooms ESPECIALLY considering their location and nearby properties. (2)Food options are meh. Expensive| basic| and you know... just Door Dash it folks. (2)The pool is a joke. It is tiny. Considering the size of the hotel I expect a larger swimming area. So with just a few guest there it felt crowded and clostrophobic. (2)The fitness center is one of the best I have seen at a hotel. I just wish I had more access (certain areas that are normally in use were closed off). (4)The customer service is what made it hard to only give 3 stars. They were courteous and understanding. I had an issue with the refrigerator that it took them a while to get to so they issued a credit to use on food. Considering I had lost some food in the fridge because of it I felt it was fair.They also allowed me to check in early| accommodated my room request| etc. Overall phenomenal customer service. (5)Now if they would just update the rooms.,Jul 11| 2021,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

From the lobby you would think the rooms had been updated. They have not; not my normal Hilton standard. The tub was peeling in the bathroom and the wall paper was peeling in the room. The drapes and carpet have not been updated. However| the employees were very nice and accommodating.,Jul 7| 2021,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Regret booking a one night stay here. I had previously stayed at the Hilton back in 2014-2015 and apparently nothing has changed. The elevator feels like it’s going to give out on you any second. There is water damage in the bathrooms. Literally bubbles of water above the bathtub. The hotel looks depressing and run down. The floor is super uneven and the carpets disgustingly dirty. We had a 2 night stay at the Westin prior to staying for one last minute night at the Hilton and wish I had spent 4x the price to stay at the Westin because at least the Westin felt safe and clean. Nothing against the employees here as they are trying to do their best with what they have but I will say they could be a bit more accommodating as well.,Jul 7| 2021,1,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Place is horrible the dam fridge in the room kept me and my family up all night the motor to the fridge is loud. When we first got here the staff let a Karen cut the line in which we waited for check about 20mins walking in the hallway to get to the room and dry wall was literally falling from the ceiling. Definitely not like the Hilton’s I’m used to staying in.

Nothing against the employees here as they are trying to do their best with what they have but I will say they could be a bit more accommodating as well.,Jul 7| 2021,1,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Stains on the walls. Hairdryer not working. Refrigerator not keeping beverages cold. Floors feel lopsided.,Jul 7| 2021,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Place is horrible the dam fridge in the room kept me and my family up all night the motor to the fridge is loud. When we first got here the staff let a Karen cut the line in which we waited for check about 20mins walking in the hallway to get to the room and dry wall was literally falling from the ceiling. Definitely not like the Hilton’s I’m used to staying in. Do not recommend and will definitely not stay here should have booked the double tree down the road.,Jul 7| 2021,1,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Very decrepid,Jul 7| 2021,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
We had booked for 2 nights more than a month in advance  and our reservation was cancelled just a day before our check-in because they OVER-BOOKED. Huh..wasn't our fault. Never going to trust them again,Jul 7| 2021,1,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

The rep who checked us in wasn’t helpful at all| she only gave us our room key and ran credit card. The room itself had a dirty floor and a band-aid on the door.

Lots of elevators and they are fast. Within walking distance to Disney entrance. Nice lobby with a Starbucks. Room was nice and clean. Staff were all friendly. Early check in only cost $25. The only negatives were there isn't a free shuttle to the park| no free WiFi unless you are a Hilton member| and the ice machine near our room was broken for the 4 days we were there.

I like the fact the manager did her job and made us comfortable. What i did nit like is paying for parking in a parking garage that was owned by Hilton it was very expensive and parking should be free if your paying for a room that cost over $150.00 a night to stay and they need more disabled parking for the disabled like one level just for disabled. Its not ok that we have to wheel far to get to an elevator with a wheelchair thats the only down fall but they should be like the airpirt where its just for disabled.

However the room's AC was very loud when set at very cool temp| it could have used a couple of minor repairs in bathroom| the tv could've been bigger and smart with access to netflix and such| and there was no microwave unless paying $35 per stay.  Also| on-site parking was a bit expensive.  There were amenities we didn't use nor care for| such as gym| spa| and bar.  Also there is a convenient bus stop at the middle of this and Marriott's main entrances which had multiple lines including to the Disney Parks; however the service was not as efficient as they required multiple apps to get and use tickets| had no regular schedule| and it would take a long time to leave as people would struggle scanning their digital tickets one by one.,Jul 4| 2021,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

The room needed an update. The desk looked old and had chunks of the wood missing from the edges from years of wear.  The pillows were tiny and the bed was really hard. The air conditioning kept turning on even though we shut it off.  It was freezing. There was a long black hair in the complementary toiletries.  Our reservation came with free breakfast but we skipped it on the second day because it was so bad the first morning.  The Mickey inspired waffle was nasty.  I had my husband try it and he actually spit it out.  It was supposed to come with whipped cream| mixed berries and syrup.  The "mixed berries" ended up being some kind of compote. Even the wheat toast was bad. It was overcooked on the edges and raw in the middle.  Overall| I'd say I was disappointed given that this is a Hilton.  I guess they figure they're close to the convention center and will always do business so quality is not too important.,Jun 30| 2021,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Our room was quite nice with a a fair amount of natural light from a large bay window. The bed was comfortable| the shower head was higher than most (we're both tall people) and the desk/table rolled out| which was nice for us as we travel with board and card games to pass the time. Our refrigerator frequently and loudly made popping and clicking noises that startled us both in the middle of the night. Checking out proved confusing at first as well. The "Zip Out" checkout button on the phone went to a full voicemail box. Additionally| despite on-screen instructions to use a menu button on the TV's remote| there was no such functionality. It wasn't until we spoke to guest relations on the way out that we learned of the texting-based check out and one posted sign in the lobby| rather than info provided during check-in or information left in the room with instructions.,Jun 30| 2021,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Booked a 2 night stay for a larger room.  Was told for the 2nd night| that they didn’t have the room available so we’d have to check out from first room and check into a 2nd room.

As soon as we checked into our room we noticed in the bathroom that the shower handle was off and sitting on the side of the bathtub I called the front desk and told them and they said they would send someone up| they never did.

Easy access to lobby from parkinglot. Good signage so you didn't get lost. We were there for something at the convention center| which was very close too! Thank you. Side Comment: Expedia would only let us cancel the reservation 48 hours out from our date of stay| whereas the hotel would have let us cancel 24 hours out. So beware of the cancellation time.

This is a very nice hotel to stay in however with summer almost here the crowds are coming out I had Tom put up with people talking loud I.

When we got to the hotel we were told that they no longer had our room available. The young lady was very nice and found us an alternative. The view was nice but I do not think that the room had been dusted or vacuumed since they were closed| sheets  had not been refreshed and the towels were probably the same ones that sat in the bathroom while they remained closed. They smelled musty. Overall| not what I expected. Pool is very small and when you stay at a hotel that large you would think the amenities would be reflective| they are not. When I checked out received an emailed receipt and I was charged 3 days of parking| when I did not have car and used Uber. The person that I spoke to reversed the charges| but did not explain why I was charged. Had I not reviewed my receipt would have been charged for something we did not use.

I chose to stay at this hotel since it was close to Disneyland. The lobby looked amazing when checking in. I felt like I was in a high-class hotel. The elevators to the parking garage brought me directly to the lobby. The reception staff was helpful and nice. I had an issue with neighbors smoking in an adjacent room which staff promptly fixed. The lobby had a Starbucks inside of it which was great for a quick breakfast| however| they charged several dollars extra for items which made the process expensive. When I saw the room I was slightly disappointed by the quality. The bathroom door ( which slides closed like a closet door) was sticking against the carpet. The bed was squeaky and the pillows felt cheap. Using one pillow and my head was on the mattress. Using two pillows kept my head at an uncomfortable incline. The mini-fridge in the room kept my bottled waters at a slightly chilled temperature. The water pressure in the room was low but comfortable. Based on my three-day stay| I would rate the front of the hotel and the lobby as a 5 out of 5. Sadly| I would rate the room as a 3 out of 5. I hope the Hilton would put more effort into the rooms as they did the lobby.,Jun 6| 2021,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
This Hilton has been a long time favorite of my family’s. However after this last stay I think I might look at some other properties before booking this location again. It is need of an update| the rooms| pool| hallways| restaurant| menu| I’ve been staying there for almost 10 years and things are close to identical. On the plus side it’s has a warm nostalgia about it all. But with the area becoming filled with newer hotels I just feel like this one now falls a little short. Great location.,Jun 5| 2021,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
The hotel was nice but the room itself was kind of old and dirty. The bathroom had hair| dirt| and mold...and the mirror had discoloration around the edges from poor ventilation. The bedroom furniture was covered in a layer of dust. But the housekeeping was kind helpful. The hotel has hidden fees...they don’t mention when booking that they require a $50 security deposit. When checking in they say you’ll get it back but on the bill at checkout there is no mention of a return and we have yet to see it. Parking is expensive. But I will say our flight got in early the the hotel was very accommodating with an early check in. They have a Starbucks and convenient store in the lobby which is nice... but for a Hilton I would have expected a cleaner room and watch out for those hidden fees.,Jun 4| 2021,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Access to Disneyland Resort was great and reasonable.,Apr 26| 2020,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Be warned. This hotel caters only to conferences. The foodcourt closed early and $21 a day| not 24 hours for parking. The food was expensive| so we chose to go out and have pizza delivered (Pizza Hut was very fast| hot| and came to room: big plus). I would stay somewhere closer (we walked) that has free parking.,Mar 16| 2020,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Sorry but the rates to park are vehicle were way too much also paying for WiFi is NOT ok for how much we paid for our room. Overall I won’t be here again.,Mar 16| 2020,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Very nice hotel at a very good price. However| it is showing its age in several areas. Everything is clean but some things are pretty worn. Would still recommend this location if staying in the Disney/Convention Center area.,Mar 15| 2020,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

I liked that is was easy access to Disneyland... the one major negative we experienced is finding a pair of  boxers on the floor next to courtyard window...grossed us out of course and made me believe that the room wasn’t that clean after all.,Mar 5| 2020,1,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Broken furniture and leaking shower head. Very disappointing.,Mar 5| 2020,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

I made a mistake on reservations and they would not accommodate me on any credit. They have the worse customer service. Dont try to contact the front desk ever because no one it there and dont try to call to talk to anyone!! Horrible service.

It was a nice property overall| but it wasn't very clean in the room| and also seemed fairly old and a bit run-down. It could definitely use a good cleaning and a facelift| in general. The restaurant was really| really good| and the staff was quite nice. I think it was just that it was because it is an older property. Also| please| please| please add outlets to the rooms!

Check in was quick and helpful. We booked for Saturday night. We planned to go to. Disneyland for Saturday and Sunday. We were able to park before we checked in and also all day Sunday. It was about a 15-20 minute walk to the park. We didn’t mind because we knew we were gonna be walking all day anyway. The rooms were very clean. Did not get to experience any amenities but saw there were a lot available to us and we wished we could stay just to hang out at the hotel!

Our Air conditioner took 3 hours to cool our room| it was over 80 degrees...The maintenance guy looked at it and said it was working but the unit was too small for the corner room.,Feb 10| 2020,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
The room was really bad. The bed felt old and not comfortable at all. We can hear all the noice around the room. Don’t like it at all.,Feb 10| 2020,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Looks great in the lobby. We were hoping the rooms would be clean. Instead they were dark with dirty carpet. I love staying at the Hilton but wow this place needs an upgrade.,Feb 9| 2020,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Like almost any Hilton the property it self was great! We where traveling with a toddler and my next door neighbors decided to smoke pot lol!!!With that said I called front desk and stated that the odor was extreme and coming into my room with my toddler| they stated they would send security. We left and came back and the smell was worse| so I called again and they offered to come up and deodorize our room! First of all from the get go it would just have been so much better if they had just offered to move us instead of me asking to! I am not the type of person to be asking for anything just part of customer service i would have expected that| so due to the fact I had my child I had to ask! Or else honestly I would have not mind! Other than this event everything se was great. So hotel and amenities 5 star! But customer service cannot say the same!,Feb 9| 2020,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
The pool had a fun kids area| there were nice little touches like water with oranges available in the lobby.  I mile to Disney on a nice tree lined sidewalk.,Feb 8| 2020,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

I booked this hotel specifically to be able to take my 4 and 8 year old to the indoor pool. When we checked in I was told the indoor pool access was only available for people ages 16 and above. They would not refund my money at first. I told them I was willing to pay for a day| if they would reimburse me for the second day so I could relocate to a different hotel. It was nice| but I really booked it for the pool so I couldn't justify the higher cost. Finally| I guess they preferred to lose all my money because they said they would refund all my costs but I would have to relocate right then. No problem| I called Expedia and they were able to solve my issue| relocate my children and I. I only lost three hours on top of late check in time of 4 pm. It was a great hassle| but lesson learned!

It's a nice location and away just a little bit from Disneyland| but I was unhappy with the hallways and room; they are very outdated and dusty. The staff mentioned that the property will see a remodel soon! There were two large spiders that came out of the headboard as I was sleeping in the middle of the night. For the two nights I was there| the toilet never flushed properly. They removed the toilet| brought it back| came back again and again to fix it| but it never worked. The shower wasn't draining properly. Overall| the two days were annoying and inconvenient. However| the lobby| overall look and feel of the hotel are very nice| and the staff are accommodating and pleasant to deal with.,Jan 3| 2020,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

When we arrived we were greeted by valet and the check in process was easy. The hotel is big so we did get lost many times going in and out of our room. The room was clean and simple. We stayed at this hotel during our visit to Disneyland. While the walk isn’t bad| I appreciated that the Disney parking lot With complimentary shuttles to the park was just a walk across the street. I would Stay here again,Jan 3| 2020,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Close to Disneyland. Very nice hotel. Was glad to stay there. Would go back.,Jan 3| 2020,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Property was clean| staff was friendly| and bed was comfortable.,Jan 4| 2020,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
It's a nice location and away just a little bit from Disneyland| but I was unhappy with the hallways and room; they are very outdated and dusty. The staff mentioned that the property will see a remodel soon! There were two large spiders that came out of the headboard as I was sleeping in the middle of the night. For the two nights I was there| the toilet never flushed properly. They removed the toilet| brought it back| came back again and again to fix it| but it never worked. The shower wasn't draining properly. Overall| the two days were annoying and inconvenient. However| the lobby| overall look and feel of the hotel are very nice| and the staff are accommodating and pleasant to deal with.,Jan 3| 2020,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Extremely coherent process to obtain anything I needed,Jan 3| 2020,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

This Hilton appears to be around 2005-2010 vintage on its last refresh| and it is the most bland| boring| taupe-on-dark-taupe kind of mediocre design aesthetic that would bore you even if you were on a business trip.... except you're not| because t's next to flippin' DISNEYLAND. The suite had one piece of art on the walls. Brown carpet| brown wall| brown drapes. Big| empty brown walls. The bare minimum. I've stayed in an Extended Stay motel that puts this to shame. Rusted mirror in the bathroom? Really guys? I would honestly rank this hotel BELOW a Hyatt House (a down-market brand). Anyway| I popped an extra antidepressant to get through it| and stayed two nights and got the hell out of there before the Insurance Actuarials of America conference showed up. $400/night. Get with it| HIlton Anaheim. You're better than this and your owner here has become way too lax in upkeep.

The food court needs better options.  There is only 1 Starbucks for hundreds if not thousands of guests.  The line in the morning was ridiculous.  The basketball court is dark and dingy.,Jan 2| 2020,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

We stayed at this location because past Hilton experiences have been pleasant. This location was very busy (understandably with the holiday)| the valet| Jerry was amazing and was extremly helpful. Past that point it was mostly downhill. The check in process was fairly quick and painless but the room was dirty (think slime in the tub)| the hallways were dirty| lights were out in some sections| the lounge was basic but plesant| the new room was dark (as it turns out the hotel rooms just are not facing the correct direction for optimal natural light| we were told we could view the fireworks from the property (this is not the case) but we only found that out after asking another guest relations specialist (giving us 20 mins to get to a more appropriate location). The lounge was closed for dining guests only| which made very little sense as it stayed empty all the times we walked by. We were saying for our before/after wedding ceremony and were left with a mediocre taste. We are generally very easy going but when we checked out there were dirty Qtips right at our door step| dishes all over| dirt clumps| some substance I don't think I want to know the details of within eyesight. The concierge never answered the phone| guest services was very pleasant but unfortunately they could only transfer us to the appropriate department (who never answered their phones). Overall I give the pleasantness of the staff an A+ despite all the turmoil (especially the valets). Cleanliness overall D.,Jan 1| 2020,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

It was freezing cold in that whole hotel. We will never stay there again. We will go to the Marriott from now on. The bar staff were less than desirable.

At check in on Christmas Eve| we requested to be on level 12 with family but the initial front desk receptionist said “they were 100% booked”. So we were given a room on level 5| perfectly fine. The hallway had a light odor| and upon entering the room it also smelled like wet carpet. Approx 1/4 of the floor was soaked. Luckily we were given an alternative room on level 10 by a different receptionist| as well as a $50 credit for the inconvenience (so| it must be in their script to say the hotel is 100% booked) Aside from the squeaky pipes and plumbing in room #2| it did the job. We were sad to find out that in order to use the amenities| gym and basketball court it would cost an additional $20/day. The Starbucks located in the hotel was appreciated. We asked to extend our stay one more night| but again| “the hotel is 100% booked” so we ended staying our final night at a competitor nearby.

I like that the location to Disney is great| just a 20 minute walk and the price is good too. But there were several issues all starting with room key. We called guest services who sent security who never came. We went downstairs and even though the woman said it was probably the door battery| she gave us knew keys and said try that first which of course didn’t work. We finally got in touch with someone who sent someone up to change the battery and finally after 40 minutes of back and forth we were in our room. Room was ok but there was someone’s hair all over the bathtub and walls and the heater didn’t work. After leaving for the day and coming back| the room key did not work in the elevator so we had to go get it re-keyed. Day after| coming back again late door key did not work AGAIN| so we had to get it re-keyed. The front desk said “you’re from Reno| you know how it goes.” Although he was very pleasant| no| I don’t know how it goes.,Dec 27| 2019,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

We have a family of four and have stayed at this hotel a few times and have always had a great experience. We have stayed here for both Disneyland trips and while using the convention center. The lobby is beautiful and the staff is very courteous. It is a little bit of a walk to Disneyland from here| so for younger kids I would reccomend the shuttle| but older children and teenagers should be able to handle the walk just fine. The rooms are moderately quiet| but if people are talking in the hallways they can be heard pretty well. The price varies greatly so sometimes you can stay here for much cheaper than other hotels in the area but othertimes it onw of the more expensive ones. Overall a great experience.,Dec 27| 2019,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

The room was fair. The privacy between rooms was terrible. The guests in the room were up most of the night and we could hear EVERY WORD and SOUND they made down to the passing of gas in the restroom. It sounded as if they were on our porch with the door open . The walls were so thin that we did not sleep until they did... even then we were so tired and frustrated it was still impossible.  The room service did however go out of their way and made us the most amazing Banana splits( not on the menu) that it ALMOST made up for the lack of sleep. The homemade whipped cream was “to die for!! Also the floor in our room was  extremely slanted for what we can assume the the building had settled. Our family members didn’t have the same experience on 2 floors up.  Also sometime during the night there was a flood and the hallway flooded. The holiday decorations in the lobby were beautiful!

Nice. Starbucks in hotel. Friendly staff. Clean. Parking is expensive,Nov 26| 2019,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Gorgeous grounds. Super convenient to everything i wanted tp go to. But room was motel 6 dated| stains on wall| paper thin walls| no fan in bathroom (?)| and the "lanai" was in truth| just a rooftop helipad that the check in girl talmed me into| that i paid extra for ugh. Oh| and stains down the side of the cabinet. The staff was either fantastic or openly hostile - take your pick. I had one staff member actually roll eyes at me for asking for scissors at the help desk. Im a nice guy and im thinking its not me| its her.  Its whatever| i was right next to the convention center| but next year ill walk a little further. The Hilton did not impress? I repeatedly thought "This hotel is hundreds a night| and its soooo basic." Not minimal| basic.,Nov 25| 2019,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Good| central location to Disneyland. Definitely recommend taking the ART shuttle ($6/day or multi-day passes available). Guest Services staff were awesome!,Nov 26| 2019,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
The hotel is nice but it’s a shame that they charge to use the gym,Nov 26| 2019,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
The room was fair. The privacy between rooms was terrible. The guests in the room were up most of the night and we could hear EVERY WORD and SOUND they made down to the passing of gas in the restroom. It sounded as if they were on our porch with the door open . The walls were so thin that we did not sleep until they did... even then we were so tired and frustrated it was still impossible.  The room service did however go out of their way and made us the most amazing Banana splits( not on the menu) that it ALMOST made up for the lack of sleep. The homemade whipped cream was “to die for!! Also the floor in our room was  extremely slanted for what we can assume the the building had settled.

Lobby was beautiful| clean rooms. Didn’t like the price to park and the $28 breakfast buffet was a bit much. Not really worth the price.

The hotel is nice and clean. Easy walk to Disneyland. Beds were comfortable. Staff were all very nice. We did not try the restaurant. But room service food was decent. The only thing is the rooms are nothing great for being a Hilton and paying the extra price. Other hotel in the area are cheaper and just as nice of a room.

The customer service and amenities were nice. There’s a food court & Starbucks which were awesome. What I was disappointed about was the condition of room. The bed was comfortable but overall room needed an upgrade/remodel. The pictures online were a lot nicer than the actual room. I probably won’t stay here again until the rooms are nicer.,Oct 28| 2019,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Room was nice| great price| view of the courtyard. Clean| no noisy neighbors| all I can really complain about it the green LED that’s always on in the fire alarm (I like pitch black sleeping). Close walk to everything. Pleased overall.,Oct 28| 2019,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Air Conditioner was busted constantly on an extremely hot week. Hot water in the shower didn’t work consistently| we had to get in the habit of waking up early to start running the water to get it hot (ice cold every morning) wifi was free but not really? Half of our party was given a free wifi for the week the other half was told to pay| the wifi also cuts out every time you swap between the lobby and your room. Pool and Hot Tub was great and location to the park was nice. The ART bus for Disney is a waste of money| just Uber/Lyft to the parks| cheaper| more reliable,Oct 28| 2019,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

The Hotel was nice | it had everything I needed. I thought the staff were Very Very Nice and helpful 👍,Oct 28| 2019,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
The hotel is nice and clean. Easy walk to Disneyland. Beds were comfortable. Staff were all very nice. We did not try the restaurant. But room service food was decent. The only thing is the rooms are nothing great for being a Hilton and paying the extra price. Other hotel in the area are cheaper and just as nice of a room. Wish it had a microwave in the room.,Oct 28| 2019,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

The customer service and amenities were nice. There’s a food court & Starbucks which were awesome. What I was disappointed about was the condition of room. The bed was comfortable but overall room needed an upgrade/remodel. The pictures online were a lot nicer than the actual room. I probably won’t stay here again until the rooms are nicer.,Oct 28| 2019,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Room was nice| great price| view of the courtyard. Clean| no noisy neighbors| all I can really complain about it the green LED that’s always on in the fire alarm (I like pitch black sleeping). Close walk to everything. Pleased overall.,Oct 28| 2019,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Air Conditioner was busted constantly on an extremely hot week. Hot water in the shower didn’t work consistently| we had to get in the habit of waking up early to start running the water to get it hot (ice cold every morning) wifi was free but not really? Half of our party was given a free wifi for the week the other half was told to pay| the wifi also cuts out every time you swap between the lobby and your room. Pool and Hot Tub was great and location to the park was nice. The ART bus for Disney is a waste of money| just Uber/Lyft to the parks| cheaper| more reliable,Oct 28| 2019,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Very convenient to convention center as well as to Disneyland. Modern and clean| we enjoyed our stay. A nice touch was the hotel brought cake and a card up to our room for my sons birthday.,Oct 28| 2019,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Very nice hotel| room was very spacious| although not clean| found socks from the previous guests under the table.,Oct 28| 2019,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Clean| safe| upscale property with easy access to Disneyland shuttle. Onsite amenities such as the store| food court and Disneyland kiosk were great,Oct 26| 2019,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
For a Hilton| you'd expect more. Overall nice hotel| very clean| service is great| but the rooms seemed a bit crammed. -The bathroom was super tiny and when the door opened (inward) it was about an inch away from hitting the toilet. -The closet was pretty small and when that door opened it always slammed on the wall.-My biggest disappointment was that the mini fridge didn't have a freezer section as most other hotels we've stayed at. We drove 8 hours with a 2 year old so we had to pack freezer packs in an ice chest to keep his milk cold. So| by the time we had to drive back home| we had to stop for ice at a gas station because our packs were melted.-EVERYTHING has a charge- the breakfast ($70) for my husband| toddler| and myself. Shuttle to Disneyland parks had a charge (1-day passes or 3-day $16 I believe)| using the gym was $30 for one day.I joked with my husband that even a fart would cost you some $$Last year we stayed at the Marriott SpringHill Suites and to be honest the rooms were much more spacious| breakfast was amazing| freezer in the mini fridge| and just a short walk to the park!,Oct 26| 2019,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

It looks amazing in pictures| the lobby is beautiful and so is everything else in that area. However| the rooms look old| they were also filled with dust with whatever they clean them with and even then the rooms were not “clean.” I don’t expect them to be “squeaky” clean but there were crumbs and little pieces of trash left in the drawers and around the floor| and this was when we first checked in. I asked to have the room be cleaned again but once again their was dust everywhere from what they use to wipe stuff off and they did not get any of the little stuff I had mentioned. Because of this we decided to only have them switch out our towels and make the bed instead of actually cleaning the whole room everyday. The staff was friendly and understanding. You can only get WiFi in the rooms if you are apart of the Hilton honors club| which all you have to do is sign up with email| but it’s just crappy that we pay so much to stay there and not even get free WiFi without having to sign up for a bunch of other junk email. It’s a good walking distance from the parks and other stuff around. Easy 15-20 min walk. The Starbucks was a nice touch but the employees were very rude| they made my coffee well enough so I guess it as ok.,Oct 25| 2019,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Hotel was old and grungy. Furniture was old and upholstery was torn.  Lobby was loud.We stayed one night and left the next day.,Oct 25| 2019,1,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

ordered a dessert with extra ice cream to take upstairs.  It didn't have the extra ice cream| when brought to there attention| they gave me the extra ice cream and removed the charge from my bill.,Oct 21| 2019,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

It’s clear that they have put a lot of money into maintaining the restaurant| bar| pool| and those types of amenities however the room was outdated and in disrepair. There was mystery dried red goo on the walls| dirty marks on the ceiling| the beds were lumpy and uncomfortable| the shower was extremely difficult to moderate the temperature| the control to switch from shower to bath was difficult to use| the bath plug leaked| and so on. It was really disappointing that a hotel charging a minimum of $250 a night for the cheapest room wouldn’t at least offer a continental breakfast when similar hotel chains at similar price points to| and that parking was so expensive. Aside from that| they didn’t have the king size room we reserved and instead gave us a room with two queen size beds| which was frustrating.

We had a great stay! Took the kids to Disneyland. We brought our truck that’s lifted and we were able to keep it safe in valet parking.  Hotel was always busy because of the convention center. | but check in/out was a breeze. It’s very close to Disneyland but we still took the bus which we never seemed to wait more than 5 min for. Totally recommend getting bus pass if your going to DL. It was nice to take breaks from the park and enjoy the nice pool area at the hotel. We had a room on the 5th floor that opened up to the pool deck. It was perfect. Only complaint I have is that I ordered Chips and salsa by the pool. Paid $25 and it wasn’t busy but somehow they forgot about me. I lost track of time 35 minutes later I walked up to the bar and they apologized that that forgot about me. I’m not sure how because it was not busy. Oh well. Lessons learned. Overall we were very pleased Also the gift shops had Way cheaper prices for DL items.

I had a standard king bed room. Pros: large remodeled lobby| with all amenities| full service Starbucks| several quick service restaurants| one full service bar/bites and a full service dining restaurant| & car rental agency on site. When your looking for convenience at your finger tips this is it. Steps to convention center. To Disneyland you can catch free park shuttle 5 min walk to the Toy Story parking lot across street. You can Uber for about $8 a ride. Or you can walk| we walked one night we timed it| exactly 15 minutes at a regular pace. The room/bathroom was clean.Cons: the rooms & hotel hallways are outdated. Our room was old & outdated did not feel up to level of a hotel rated 4stars. The lobby has been renovated but as soon as you step out of the elevator you go into a 1983 hallway time warp| & when entering the room you go into 2000 time warp (which is when I’m assuming these two were last renovated. The carpet in our room has seen its better days & so has many of the room furnishings. For this reason we wouldn’t stay again unless it was in a renovated room. The Marriott hotel across the street has similar prices & all their rooms have been renovated. Also this is one of the largest hotels in the west coast| the architecture shape of the hotel building assuming shaped like an “H” because you go through a maze to get to your rooms| not a problem for us| but something to consider if you have mobility or time issues.,Sep 9| 2019,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

When we arrived we immediately noticed that one of the water bottles provided (at additional charge) was already opened.. trash cans had no bags| no laundry bag provided| Hilton Honors WiFi was so hard to connect to| the toilet seat was broken| parking is cheaper for non guests than it is for actual guests| windows were dirty| the room itself just looked so off and the coffee maker looked like it was recently used- it was still wet in the water compartment. The stay was way less than what I expected for a Hilton and once everything was mentioned to the front desk| all we were offered was a water?

We have issues when we try to check it take us almost an hour| because Hilton Anaheim told us our registration it was process| so we have to call expedia custumer service and they said transaction was complete on their end| so we ask to speak to a Manager(Lori) at Hilton and she said check ins sometimes takes longer than an hour| she was very rude and seem she didn't care about the situatuation.

Small rooms| too far from Disneyland if you are coming back at night with 2 sleeping children and on top of that I need to pay for parking| is dumb to pay for parking when I'm staying in the hotel| I understand for people not staying in the hotel| do they expect that we were get in there walking| and they didn't plan for cars?,Sep 8| 2019,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

I expected more with the  hilton name|  the bathroom had hair|  and the bathroom knobs falling off.  Your a guest and paying for your room and you dint get free wifi|  and you pay for parking|  this should all come with the room.

The hotel is conventiently located 3 long blocks from Disneyland. The Anahiem Convention Ctr is right next door. There is a simple food court if you dont want to pay alot on room service / food. There is also a Starbucks coffee on the 1st floor. But it closes very early. I assume the hotel food service is what they want guests to pay for instead. I get it. The room was nice. Desk is hooked up with a laptop / charging / internet jacks. TV was basic and will charge you to watch premium movies. HBO was free. Bed was terribly soft and muddy. As well as the pillows. But I may be used to a more firm bed. Lots of extra towels. Be careful when taking your first shower as there are 2 towels inside the shower? And for environmentally friendly types| there was a small sign stating if you dont want your towels washed every day| simply hang them up dry and the housekeeping staff will not spend the resources to was / dry / stock them until you place them on the floor. Overall| this was a fine visit. The Expedia service was almost effortless. Now to pay the bills...,Sep 6| 2019,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

What can I say....it's a Hilton. Spacious lobby| good sized room| comfortable bed| and great location. The rate I got was amazing. The service was friendly and helpful. If you plan on going to Disneyland| as I was| this is a very nice place to stay at. Not far from the park| and you have a very secure| safe and family feel to it. The shuttle to Disneyland is a bus that makes a few stops on the way| but it is not that expensive and still only takes about 10 minutes to get there. However| the buses that return from Disneyland to the Hilton stop running just before the park closes. Be mindful of this. Another big drawback is that there is no hotel shuttle to the Orange County(John Wayne) airport . Nevertheless| it is a splendid hotel.

Staying here is sufficient for a Hilton experience. I expected a bit more from the on-property gym but that is probably because I regularly go to a very nice gym. The rooms are OK in size but expect to be able to hear your neighbors - I could hear plates| a fussy baby| etc. and this concerned me that perhaps our TV or alone time could be heard. I prefer the location about a mile away - suites for the price of a small room here. However| there is much to be able to walk to from this location.,Sep 5| 2019,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Upon arrival our air conditioning was not turned on so our room was very hot considering it was in the 90’s outside. We turned it on and left for about 5 hours. Still hot in the room. No windows or balcony to air it out. Had to have someone repair the air conditioner. After that the air was fine. The pictures and reviews looked a lot nicer than this hotel actually is. It looks good when you walk in but the hotel is older and not in a good way. The floor looks like it’s sinking when you walk through the halls like the building has settled. The room was outdated along with the bathroom. Felt more like a 2 or maybe 3 star. Our bedding was very old and used which grossed me out. It looked like an old towel that’s been used for 10  years that needs to be thrown away. It also smelt like a pool. It had two sheets to cover and dress it up so overall very thin bedding. I will say our room had a beautiful view of the city| sunrise| and sunset. The pool was fun| could just use a few more umbrellas for busy days. Service at the hotel was great. Checking in and out was a breeze. No additional surprise charges. I really enjoyed the Starbucks inside the lobby.,Sep 5| 2019,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Everything went fine. Room had a strange red stain on the floor but I let it be. Check in and check out went well| though they tried to charge parking even though I never used it. I asked them not to charge me starting first day and someone at that front desk told me they removed it but at check out time| it was still being charged. They removed it then. However| had I chosen an express check out| I would've been charged. Pool area and bar staff were my favorite. Super friendly and great to talk to. Room and view were great.,Aug 30| 2019,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Overall the hotel is clean and safe. The staff are friendly and answered all of our questions. The location to Disney (which is why we were there) is about a 20min walk if you want to do that. It’s fine in the morning but a bit of a journey at the end of a long day if you don’t take the shuttle or an Uber. It does show the wear and tear of high turnover at times. Although the maintenance team is actively trying to stay on top of it.,Aug 30| 2019,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Room is pretty clean.  Bedding quite comfortable. Just missing one set of towel on the first night. 3 sets of towel for 4 people. Have to join hilton loyalty program to get free wifi. A bite of trouble. Starbuck on premise quite handy . A bit far to walk to  Disneyland.  But okay if your  kids are not too small. Used art bus to get around after walking for 3 days.,Aug 31| 2019,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

The hotel was great overall! Our room was very clean and comfortable when we arrived. We had dinner at MIX our first night. The veal/pasta entree was okay at best. We also ordered the pepperoni pizza which was much better. We took the rest of the pizza back to the room because we thankfully had a mini fridge. We had dinner at Disneyland all other days. Speaking of — we walked to Disneyland both days we went and the distance wasn’t bad to walk.On our last day| we went to the pool. The pools open early and check-in is at noon| so we were able to use the pools before leaving with plenty time to spare. The outdoor pool is free to use| but there’s a charge for the indoor pool.When we checked out| we went downstairs and the line was long so we opted for the express check-out via text which was much easier.

Common areas are beautiful| rooms are rather dated but still comfortable. Great property to stay at when using convention center. Had an issue with housekeeping in room that was eventually handled by manager. Still disappointing to deal with in first place.

Out of 4 computer stations only one was working properly.Restaurants food is good and service there is great but they are very expensive.Overall the hotel was not satisfactory compared to the Hilton Hotel reputation or the cost paid for the stay.,Jun 23| 2019,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

It had a lot to offer where it was located to be able to walk around the area. It also had different options of food places and a nice atmosphere. The entire staff was friendly and helpfulThe guest room area hall was extremely noisy and the pull out couch was not made up to sleep in and was squeaky loud and uncomfortable,Jun 23| 2019,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Room was clean and comfortable but room service trays were left in the hallway too long.  Also disappointed that fees were charged for so many accommodations such as gym| pool| parking.  In-house restaurants too expensive.  Need to add a shuttle to Disneyland; only public transportation was available or had to walk.,Jun 20| 2019,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Housekeeping forgot to clean our room one morning. Also as a couple on our honeymoon they put our room right next to the elevator. The walls are thin. The ac unit didn’t work well. There was no fan in the bathroom which made the rest of the room muggy. No light above shower| so in the dark. No main lights in room only individual ones. Room was dark. Tiny closet space with no room for shoes| etc. Hinge of fridge broken. Not impressed.,Jun 20| 2019,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

My toilet was constantly running i called to have it fixed. They came up to the room in about 10 minutes which i thought was very satisfying and fixed the problem. Then after the next flush the toilet was back to constantly running and it was about 1130 at night now so i wasnt calling again. So i rigged the back of the tank to fill up once then flushed and reshut the water off. The next morning had to continuously turn the water on and off while the restroom was being used. We were headed to Disneyland so i was not going to wait for maintenance to come "fix" the problem. So shut the water off and we left. Then once we got back did the same thing over. Shutting the water off and on saved them 2 days of wasted running water. Called the people down stairs to give them the heads up that the water is shut off so it doesnt run while we check out. She said okay i will make a note of that on your account. Went down to check out| nothing was noted on my account that the bathroom was bad. Lady apologizes and gives me a $50 dollar discount. Okay fair fine whatever. BUT this is the part that rubs me wrong. While i was laying in bed the second night before i fell asleep i looked up and the fire alarm is wrapped in plastic. May not be a huge deal but i have been in a hotel where there was faulty wiring in the room a few down from me and their room filled with smoke luckily they had a fire alarm that went off and evacuated the floor. So the "what if" plays in my head. Who checks the rooms??,Jun 16| 2019,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

I liked the location of the property and the amenities offered. I didn't like that we were unable to get the type of room that we requested and that housekeeping did not come to our room until the 3rd day of our trip.,May 27| 2019,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
We enjoyed it.  Location was perfect and all of the staff were super helpful and nice.We plan to stay again next year.  We were there for business and we were put in a quiet zone.  Cool,May 27| 2019,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
The carpet in the room is looking very old.House keeping personal are not doing their job in providing the daily needs of the room.The Hotel is charging many items falsely .I advice the guests to their final bills carefully.I stayed 4 days there for attending a medical conference.,May 27| 2019,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Amazing stay we will definitely be back,May 26| 2019,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Front desk was very nice. Good proximity for Disneyland. Clean rooms| cable tv| swimming pool and water slides/play activities for the kidos... amazing room price... starbucks in the lobby...  very nice amenities and lobby... this was our second visit| looking forward to the third .. the only con is the valet price - 26bucks (unlimited in/out) is a little steep but still well worth it considering the room bargain (valet ppl are extremely nice). Highly recommend staying. 9/10.,May 26| 2019,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
very accessible to the venue of my meeting| easy access to disneyland  but the facility is getting old and need improvement. building structure|and remodeling of each room. parking is very pricey for in house guest. it should be less for those houseguest.,May 26| 2019,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Excelent service and clean rooms. Young lady at the counter was very helpful ans understanding,May 26| 2019,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Our room was not ready...sometimes understandable.. The greet staff tried to up-sell me on a different room rather than accommodating...must be a new sales program. Our room had a dead remote control for the TV| burned out light bulbs and unlike just about all the rest of the world| no WIFI unless we were HH members. Really??? Even roadside motels offer free WIFI. Lost me back to Marriott.,May 27| 2019,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Property is relatively no-frills business oriented hotel.  Staff were friendly and helpful| very responsive. It's very convenient to take the ART shuttle to and from Disneyland Resort (used a 3 day pass)| which was the reason for our stay| and it was great to see the fireworks from our room (as advertised).  The pool area and room seemed dated/tired and bathroom lacked towel bars and was not ideally arranged for use by a family of 4.  But it suited our purposes well.,May 22| 2019,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
We have been staying here last couple times we came to Disneyland and most likely will again next time. They have a Starbucks| bar with good drinks| great customer service everywhere on the hotel grounds| and honestly anything that was needed. If they had free parking for guests it would’ve been perfect but sometimes we can’t have everything.

Looks great from outside. Absolutely awful on the inside. This hotel does not have free wifi in hotel rooms| they charge $13 per day for wifi. They also have nasty tap water in their rooms with an unpleasant coming from the sink drain. If you want drinkable water| you'll need to go to the Starbucks in the lobby| but they close every day at 4pm! Not to mention the water temperature at this hotel is awful. The shower water temperature will constantly fluctuate from warm to cold every minute| making showering an unpleasant experience. As a person passing through the lobby| I would call this a 4 star hotel. The one good experience I've had was getting an early check in. As a guest staying at the hotel| it's a 2 star hotel at best.

It was nice and clean and easy to check in and out. What I wasn’t really a fan of was having to pay $14 to use the fitness center. No smart TV? I stayed at the Marriott right across last year and walked around inside the Hilton and thought it was much nicer so that’s the reason I booked with Hilton this time around but I should have gone with Marriott with the nicer room and bigger TV with smart tv function,May 14| 2019,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

The staff were very friendly and accommodating. Great communication. However| housekeeping doesn't do a very good job of cleaning the room. After my first night| I accidentally dropped an empty water bottle on the side of the night stand| completely forgot about it. The next day as I was picking up something| I saw an old lotion underneath the bed| left i there since I was going remove my DND sign to get my room cleaned| however upon returning .. I still saw the lotion underneath the bed and surprisingly the water bottle was still there. When I removed it| I saw that the back of the night stand was extremely dirty| and filled with dust. Also| I feel like they should update their TV and have USB ports.,Apr 27| 2019,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

The service and amenities are amazing. Great place to stay..easy walk to Disney or by use of bus which comes by at short times. Wish they had more kid friendly things to do on our down time hanging out at the hotel especially the pool area which was smaller than i thought. Plus side was early.check in with no fees as well as easy to get around the area if u wanted too by car. Maybe wish they had deals to lighten the cost on parking or even for Honors members but i know thats a norm and not an amenity.  Overall great stay which is why we keep.coming back,Apr 21| 2019,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

It was so dirty. Pillows are smelly because it wasn’t dry enough after washed. Table| light and phone are all dusty. Carpet is old and smell. We are totally disappointed of this hotel. We stayed for 3 nights at Hilton Anaheim and one night at Hilton LAX AIRPORT| Our family will never buy any Hilton hotel anymore.,Apr 5| 2019,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Good hotel. Beds are a bit hard but I guess some people like that. Good location. Easy access to food and Disney. No shuttle so you walk or ubber. The pool isn’t anything much. Rooms are nice and clean it the maids come at like 8am so keep your privacy tag on your door or they come in while you’re still asleep. Good price. It feels more like a business hotel for the convention center then one for a family going to Disney.,Apr 4| 2019,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Just across the street from Disneyland! The room was large and spacious| and the gym was very well equipped! Staff were always friendly and the Starbucks option as an alternative to the complimentary breakfast was a nice touch! Looking forward to my next stay at the Hilton Anaheim.,Apr 3| 2019,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
The room was small.  I was expecting a better stay for being a Hilton.  I’m a Disney annual pass holder and have stayed at a number of hotels in the area and had better stays for less money. The bathroom door was a slider with no lock and did not have a perfect seal.  Our fridge in our room did not work but we had maintence come and try to fix it but they could not so they brought in another fridge.  There was no microwave in the room also.  The lobby was amazing but the room lacked in Charm.,Apr 3| 2019,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Good location| short Uber ride to Disney.  Rooms are just okay.  Starting to look a little worn out.  The bathroom in particular was not what I would expect at this price point.  Again| looking a little worn out.  There is only one towel bar and it's in the bath/shower so your towels get damp if you hang them there.  Otherwise there is only one hook in the bathroom to hang anything else.  No where to hang hand towels etc.  Beds were comfortable| pillows were not| but I generally don't like hotel pillows| too flat after you lay on them for a few minutes.

We were visiting to attend a family member's wrestling match and go to Disneyland. We have stayed at this property 5 or 6 other times over the years and it is a nice hotel.  I marked service as average| due to the length of time it takes to check-in.  This is something I have commented on over the years and it has never been addressed.  We stood in line for 15 minutes with only 5-6 people in front of us.  The hotel had 3 counters open to check in guests and it was just slow.  This experience would not deter me from staying there again| just plan to wait in line for a while when checking in.,Jan 11| 2019,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

This time round wasn’t a great experience. The room was older and dirty| than the first time we stayed. Bed cover was dirty| had to completely take it off. Bathroom was dirty. Dirty floor| hair stuck in tub| walls| and sink. And to top it off| the hotel had some sort of protesters that lasted the two days we were there.  We were on the 10th floor and could still them well. Cow bell/drums started at 330am| then more people arrived to help scream and shout until 8am. I think the union workers  were protesting about their expired contract. ( hope it gets resolved soon for both parties).,Jan 6| 2019,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Well. Let me just say| I'm not a fan of Hilton in general. I don't like their business model (over charging you for every little thing). Having to pay for basic Internet at $12 per day is just insane. I would also say that it was a bit misleading. The amenities listed fitness center and indoor pool should be clearer. The fitness center is not free. It's $15 per day. The indoor pool is inside the fitness center and it's for 16 and older. So| my 4 and 6 years old were stuck to swim in the outdoor pool which they didn't mind at all.Parking was fine compared to other facilities in the area. The hotel was very busy| so expect the service to be the same| quickly get in quickly get out. However| the staff were professional at all the time. The person that was keeping our room was very nice and professional.The first day| the valet person who I also think serves as security or some sort of gate keeper| instructed us to go directly to the parking if we are not planning to use the valet service. This was strange and really unnecessary. We had lot of baggage to whole and we needed help. So we returned back and used the front entrance instead. The following days| I just ignored them and passed through them. They didn't like it for sure.Since Disneyland was not our only destination| it was challenging moving through the traffic. Expect one to two hours to get to anywhere else. By LA standards| this is normal.,Dec 31| 2018,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Our experience was great. The staff was great and knowledgeable about any questions we had. Our room was clean and the view was spectacular.

Door handle was broken upon our arrival and sitting on bathroom sink counter from 1st to last day| cleaning personnel did nothing but clean around it. Thermostat in room needs to be looked at/ it was either too hot or too cold and no way to adjust it to proper temperature. Last day cleaning personnel didn’t show up to clean our room until nearly 5:30PM. We had already had a full day an just wanted to rest so we just asked for trash to be taken out and for fresh towels. No reason people should be cleaning that late when check in is at 4PM.,Dec 26| 2018,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Spur of the moment decision to treat my grandchildren to a stay at the Anaheim Hilton.  Got a great rate for 1 night| the munchkins had a great time swimming in the pool.  My highlight was room service.  I had the most wonderful person who was extremely patient and kind while I got the order in for the kids and the gentleman who delivered was exceptional.  Customer service is extremely important to me and I have to say that the Hilton delivered.  It was a great stay and I will definitely return.  Thank you staff at the Hilton!

Door handle was broken upon our arrival and sitting on bathroom sink counter from 1st to last day| cleaning personnel did nothing but clean around it. Thermostat in room needs to be looked at/ it was either too hot or too cold and no way to adjust it to proper temperature. Last day cleaning personnel didn’t show up to clean our room until nearly 5:30PM. We had already had a full day an just wanted to rest so we just asked for trash to be taken out and for fresh towels. No reason people should be cleaning that late when check in is at 4PM.,Dec 26| 2018,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Spur of the moment decision to treat my grandchildren to a stay at the Anaheim Hilton.  Got a great rate for 1 night| the munchkins had a great time swimming in the pool.  My highlight was room service.  I had the most wonderful person who was extremely patient and kind while I got the order in for the kids and the gentleman who delivered was exceptional.  Customer service is extremely important to me and I have to say that the Hilton delivered.  It was a great stay and I will definitely return.  Thank you staff at the Hilton!  You were great!!!,Dec 26| 2018,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

The hotel was very crowded with not enough elevators.  The Starbucks onsite was awesome but they closed at 4pm every day.  Our room was ok.  The HVAC unit was very noisy. There was a loud clanging noise.  Service was good.  Without me asking they put all of my three room reservations right next to each other.,Dec 26| 2018,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

It’s my first and worst experience with Hilton. I called Hilton 3 days in advance to know if they provide Microwave in the room and they told me I can request one which I did. I called  Hilton on my day of my checkin around 7 pm  PDT   as I was running late due to traffic and also enquirer about the microwave| they told me it would be there in the room. I finally checked in before 12 am and when I reached  the hotel room there was no microwave and there was cold in the room. Though I was tired after driving for 10 hours and went down to know where’s the microwave and also requested for blankets as it was too cold in the room and I tried adjusting the temperature which didn’t work. The front desk executive told me it would’be there in 15-20 mins plus there would be charge waited  for an hour and again went down to check on microwave and blankets and it was around 1:30 so this time I asked for a manger and explained him the situation. I could only get one blanket and no news on microwave and after waiting till 2am I tried sleeping by putting the jackets on. I requested for microwave since my daughter was sick So we can give her something warm. So due to extreme cold in the room my daughter started coughing and I had to call my doctor. The Manger didn’t bothered to call metocueck how are things though they were terrible. Again I went down in the morning as asked for a Senior person who can understand my concern. I spoke to Fred- Assistant Director Front desk operation. Finally I,Dec 25| 2018,1,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

I have previously given a statement regarding my stay. The low light would be the semen stains on the headboard which I did not discover until the middle of the night as I was tired when I first entered the room from a long day at Disneyland with my family.  It appears they were more stains on the dust ruffle on the west side of the bed near the flightellipses Disgusting .  For the price that I paid I would’ve expected more especially under the Hilton name. But apparently on the fifth floor and the 300 wing the gas around is valued as the room was rather shabby| lacking a microwave|  couch table etc.    when I call the concierge about the fact that the ice machine on my floor was not functioning| I thought he might send a snap to me| but instead he told me to search the other wing of the floor  for another ice machine.  I also find it funny that the Wi-Fi is not free unless you’re a special member to the Hilton hotel franchise. I’ve stayed at many hotels of lesser status than Hilton with much nicer rooms and better amenities.   It just seems in less I spent $400 a night I wouldn’t have a room that I would expect staying at the Hilton. It seems it and I was considered riffraff as I was using Hotels.com and getting cheaper rooms. I’m assuming that’s what the fifth floor is for at least a 300 wing.  I suppose I expected too much. Free Wi-Fi perhaps some type of continental breakfast or at least some coffee.   There was no couch| the tv was tiny and the bathroom was shabby.,Dec 3| 2018,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Our experience was close to wonderful: The Bell Captain services at checkout (December 2nd) was outstanding (name tag says “DJ”). Our only inconvenience was upon our arrival (check-in date| December 1st). Although we have the DMV California Disabled Placard| the Vallet Parking staff did not allow us to park in a Disabled parking spot near the main entrance| stating it’s reserved for Vallet Parking only. They told us we need to go to the multi floor parking building (which I did). I called the police to confirm the rules| and they said if I have the placard| the hotel cannot stop us from using it| regardless of its location. They were willing to come for a formal complaint| but I said I would try to resolve it by myself. I then explained this to the hotel night manager| and she gave instructions to hotel staff to finally allow us to park there. Then a pizza delivery person parked his vehicle there and I had to wait till he returned| to then move my vehicle. All staff should be trained and instructed properly| and point out to not give priority to vallet customers over regular parking customers. This made us get to sleep much later than otherwise| as it was already way past midnight when we arrived at the Hilton Anaheim.

I have previously given a statement regarding my stay. The low light would be the semen stains on the headboard which I did not discover until the middle of the night as I was tired when I first entered the room from a long day at Disneyland with my family.  It appears they were more stains on the dust ruffle on the west side of the bed near the flightellipses Disgusting .  For the price that I paid I would’ve expected more especially under the Hilton name. But apparently on the fifth floor and the 300 wing the gas around is valued as the room was rather shabby| lacking a microwave|  couch table etc.    when I call the concierge about the fact that the ice machine on my floor was not functioning| I thought he might send a snap to me| but instead he told me to search the other wing of the floor  for another ice machine.  I also find it funny that the Wi-Fi is not free unless you’re a special member to the Hilton hotel franchise. I’ve stayed at many hotels of lesser status than Hilton with much nicer rooms and better amenities.   It just seems in less I spent $400 a night I wouldn’t have a room that I would expect staying at the Hilton. It seems it and I was considered riffraff as I was using Hotels.com and getting cheaper rooms. I’m assuming that’s what the fifth floor is for at least a 300 wing.  I suppose I expected too much. Free Wi-Fi perhaps some type of continental breakfast or at least some coffee.   There was no couch| the tv was tiny and the bathroom was shabby.,Dec 3| 2018,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Our experience was close to wonderful: The Bell Captain services at checkout (December 2nd) was outstanding (name tag says “DJ”). Our only inconvenience was upon our arrival (check-in date| December 1st). Although we have the DMV California Disabled Placard| the Vallet Parking staff did not allow us to park in a Disabled parking spot near the main entrance| stating it’s reserved for Vallet Parking only. They told us we need to go to the multi floor parking building (which I did). I called the police to confirm the rules| and they said if I have the placard| the hotel cannot stop us from using it| regardless of its location. They were willing to come for a formal complaint| but I said I would try to resolve it by myself. I then explained this to the hotel night manager| and she gave instructions to hotel staff to finally allow us to park there.

No instructions on how to get to your room. Took 30 minutes to find our room. After a long day and with kids it’s not the ideal situation.

Great staff all around but the rooms were very out dated. First room tried to stay but three hours into sleep there was so much banging from the elevators we couldn’t sleep and asked to be moved which thankfully they allowed. First room didn’t even have the sheets tucked in| there were cobwebs in both the bathroom and main room. Tv was small and old. Bathroom door would not shut all of the way and everything has a slight yellow tinge to it and the ac vent wasn’t fully attached to the wall. Second room was slightly better ie the bathroom door shut| no cobwebs and not loud banging from the elevator but still for the Hilton that is suppose to be third largest in the US and for the prices we paid sooooo disappointing and gross. Now the pics on their site show pretty great spots and I agree their lobby and amentities at awesome but I can’t sleep in the lobby. Also the breakfast there was almost 30 per person| food was really good but pretty pricey.,Nov 12| 2018,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Check-in was fine| then the two started taking care of customersWi-Fi was terrible,Nov 1| 2018,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
It's not always fun being at a convention. But having a nice room with good staff make it doable.,Oct 31| 2018,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Overall| everything was great. We were there for Disney and after taking the bus on the first morning| we realized it was very walkable. The pool was fun though the “splash park” was crazy cold. Food court was a nice option for reasonably priced meals with the family. Service was great and efficient. The price was only 20% of what we were seeing for the park hotels so it was absolutely the best deal,Oct 30| 2018,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Property was nice. Onsite amenities were overpriced and not many food locations withing walking distance.,Oct 30| 2018,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

This hotel connects to the convention center and features any of the services you may need for a productive business trip. The rooms are clean| bed comfortable| pillows fantastic and although the hotel is aging| the maintenance crew really does a great job in attempts to keep up.

I’ve previously stayed at this hotel and it was a great experience| however this experience was not so good. To start| when we arrived to the room| the heater was broken and there was no hot water. We let guest services know that they didn’t work| and they said that they would take care of it. Fast forward 24 hours| after a long day at Disneyland where it was raining| we came back to the room. Again no heat and there was barely any hot water. We had to use the hair dryer to blow hot air in an attempt to warm the room up. Needless to say this stay was not a good one for my family.,Oct 15| 2018,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

I’ve stayed at many Hilton’s around the world and other hotels| this by far was the worse.  For the price we pay to stay at a Hilton we should have stayed at a motel 6 or something similar to at least get a clean room!

Great location. Everything was good i can see it getting too busy during peak summer time due to close proximity with Disneyland,Sep 29| 2018,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
The toilet in the room kept running all night and the door hinge to the bathroom sliding door came right off. Parking was expensive and thought breakfast should at least be included for the price. Too much nickle and diming...,Sep 28| 2018,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Lady that checked us in was awesome! Super friendly| went over & above. Room we were given was not "city view" as we booked. And they wanted to charge us extra for a pool view or Disney view. NOPE. Pool was super small for as large as this hotel is. There was ZERO seating left at the pool for us when we got there. Really like the extra games on the patio deck. Our room was small. Sink was cracked. Shower water pressure good. Walk from self parking garage to elevators to lobby to registration to your room is L O N G . Beware. Would stay again| but its a bit overpriced for what you get & self parking is $25 I think? Receptionist told us it was a 15 min walk to Disneyland. Nope- it took us 25 minutes to walk there with all the foot traffic| the crowds & all the lights you have to wait for. Its a very far walk!,Sep 25| 2018,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
2 blocks from Disneyland| we used ART buses which pick you up and drop you off right in front of the hotel. Clean rooms and nice staff. One of our "go to" hotels if the price is right.,Sep 25| 2018,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
The hotel was very close to Disneyland| we were able to walk there. However| I wish I was able to do mobile order for the Starbucks| the line was extremely long in the mornings.,Sep 25| 2018,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Nice hotel with comfy beds and a small mini fridge and coffee maker. We stayed here so we could be within walking distance of Disney and it was within walking distance but a about a solid 20-25 minute walk since the park is so giant. We got our steps in! Only things I didn't like were the required parking charge of $21 a day to park our car in their lot as there is no other parking option and no free wifi. Other than that it was great!,Sep 12| 2018,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

The hotel was beautiful and the staff was very nice but the room seemed like a small closet at the end of the hall. You have to cram into the bathroom to get through the door and close it. And the floor was at a downward slope going toward to door. Not a bad experience but I quickly figured out why I got the room for so cheap.,Sep 6| 2018,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Direction guide to the rooms are very confuse.naanaanaanananananananana,Sep 6| 2018,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
The staff was wonderful and always very helpful! The gym facility was top notch and offered up top date equipment and classes throughout the day. However| the condition of the rooms| bathrooms| etc. was not what I would expect from Hilton. They needed updating badly and the carpet was old. Bathrooms need a serious facelift,Sep 6| 2018,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
It was nice. Everything was very clean and organized. Front desk was very helpful and checked us in quickly.,Sep 5| 2018,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
asked for area map| but hotel staff had none. expedia failed to state that the self parking cost $21.00/day. bathroom was dirty| sliding door will not open| and safe door was giving errors upon checking in. hotel check in clerk did not provide the room asked and paid for| but gave a room facing the busy| noisy pool area instead of Lanai Deck.,Sep 5| 2018,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
The stay was fine but the hotel bathroom wasn’t clean in our room. There sheets on one of the beds had a little stain on it as well which was disgusting to me. It’s time to upgrade the rooms. Out door pool was ghetto and pool looked cloudy. The plus side was All the Staff were Super Nice.,Sep 5| 2018,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
8/30/18 Luxury is in the lobby. Customer service was good at check in & I was able to check out from the room.  That was nice  I was not impress with the room. Furniture was shabby. No hook in bathroom for towel. Beds were not comfortable.  No Kleenex in room.  Room was small. I checked in after midnight; tire from being at Disneyland all day.  My daughter| my friend  and I  had to settle. I check-out at 9:30 am the next morning| felt I paid too much for the stay. No time to go check out pool.  Next time I will stay elsewhere for half the price. I'm not type to pay for the big name and not enjoy the comfort.,Sep 5| 2018,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Beds are kind of worn and we’re dipped where a person lays.,Sep 5| 2018,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Parking is kind of pricey but there is abundant amount of room in the parking structure. There was quite a wait for check-in but in their defence we stayed the weekend of the Anaheim Fitness Expo so it was very busy. We only stayed one night in a basic room. I have stayed in this hotel multiple times before and have always enjoyed my stay. On this particular trip| when we got into our room we found a dirty used bandaid on the floor by the window| a sticky spill in the refrigerator with a half empty drink| blood stain on the comforter. Definitely below standards. I would stay again though| only because all other times I've stayed at this Hilton I have never had issues.,Sep 5| 2018,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Plus: valet staff open your car door and the entry doors. This is a huge hotel with a ton of amenities on the inside (Starbucks| gift shop| bar| spa| pool| etc.) And near the convention center. We kind of enjoyed our stay.Minus: We stayed for Disneyland. My fiance and I are a fit couple and on the younger side. Briskly walking| it took us about 20 minutes from the hotel lobby to arrive in Downtown Disney. I thought it was 8-9 minutes? Front desk staff are mediocre at best. They hardly cared and just wanted you to check in and out quickly. We were pointed in the wrong direction to the elevators. Starbucks...that sounded great on paper but dang| the line was out the door all 4 days we were there. Staffing issue? The hotel is on the older side| our room had a slant leading into the bathroom. My biggest issue? No Wifi! Hotels.com advertised free Wifi...but theres a catch. It's only free in the lobby. Why would I go down to the lobby around midnight to use the wifi when I was supposed to receive it as a part of my package? I thought that I paid for it already| and Hilton Hotels did not honor it. In summary| we will not be returning. Should've stayed closer to the park in a motel| at least then the service would be warranted. First Hilton stay and probably the last.,Sep 5| 2018,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
The hotel was beautiful and the staff was very nice but the room seemed like a small closet at the end of the hall. You have to cram into the bathroom to get through the door and close it. And the floor was at a downward slope going toward to door. Not a bad experience but I quickly figured out why I got the room for so cheap.,Sep 6| 2018,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Direction guide to the rooms are very confuse.naanaanaanananananananana,Sep 6| 2018,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
The staff was wonderful and always very helpful! The gym facility was top notch and offered up top date equipment and classes throughout the day. However| the condition of the rooms| bathrooms| etc. was not what I would expect from Hilton. They needed updating badly and the carpet was old. Bathrooms need a serious facelift,Sep 6| 2018,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
It was nice. Everything was very clean and organized. Front desk was very helpful and checked us in quickly.,Sep 5| 2018,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
asked for area map| but hotel staff had none. expedia failed to state that the self parking cost $21.00/day. bathroom was dirty| sliding door will not open| and safe door was giving errors upon checking in. hotel check in clerk did not provide the room asked and paid for| but gave a room facing the busy| noisy pool area instead of Lanai Deck.,Sep 5| 2018,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
The stay was fine but the hotel bathroom wasn’t clean in our room. There sheets on one of the beds had a little stain on it as well which was disgusting to me. It’s time to upgrade the rooms. Out door pool was ghetto and pool looked cloudy. The plus side was All the Staff were Super Nice.,Sep 5| 2018,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
8/30/18 Luxury is in the lobby. Customer service was good at check in & I was able to check out from the room.  That was nice  I was not impress with the room. Furniture was shabby. No hook in bathroom for towel. Beds were not comfortable.  No Kleenex in room.  Room was small. I checked in after midnight; tire from being at Disneyland all day.  My daughter| my friend  and I  had to settle. I check-out at 9:30 am the next morning| felt I paid too much for the stay. No time to go check out pool.  Next time I will stay elsewhere for half the price. I'm not type to pay for the big name and not enjoy the comfort.,Sep 5| 2018,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Beds are kind of worn and we’re dipped where a person lays.,Sep 5| 2018,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Parking is kind of pricey but there is abundant amount of room in the parking structure. There was quite a wait for check-in but in their defence we stayed the weekend of the Anaheim Fitness Expo so it was very busy. We only stayed one night in a basic room. I have stayed in this hotel multiple times before and have always enjoyed my stay. On this particular trip| when we got into our room we found a dirty used bandaid on the floor by the window| a sticky spill in the refrigerator with a half empty drink| blood stain on the comforter. Definitely below standards. I would stay again though| only because all other times I've stayed at this Hilton I have never had issues.,Sep 5| 2018,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Plus: valet staff open your car door and the entry doors. This is a huge hotel with a ton of amenities on the inside (Starbucks| gift shop| bar| spa| pool| etc.) And near the convention center. We kind of enjoyed our stay.Minus: We stayed for Disneyland. My fiance and I are a fit couple and on the younger side. Briskly walking| it took us about 20 minutes from the hotel lobby to arrive in Downtown Disney. I thought it was 8-9 minutes? Front desk staff are mediocre at best. They hardly cared and just wanted you to check in and out quickly. We were pointed in the wrong direction to the elevators. Starbucks...that sounded great on paper but dang| the line was out the door all 4 days we were there. Staffing issue? The hotel is on the older side| our room had a slant leading into the bathroom. My biggest issue? No Wifi! Hotels.com advertised free Wifi...but theres a catch. It's only free in the lobby. Why would I go down to the lobby around midnight to use the wifi when I was supposed to receive it as a part of my package? I thought that I paid for it already| and Hilton Hotels did not honor it. In summary| we will not be returning. Should've stayed closer to the park in a motel| at least then the service would be warranted.

Staff was terribly rude| the rooms we’re a mess| worst place I’ve ever stayed in! I wouldn’t spend 10 dollars to stay here let alone 1000,Sep 4| 2018,1,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Beds are hard as a brick and the room lacked cleanliness overall. The walls and carpet were extremely dirty. Also couldn't figure out why the floors severely slanted down towards the center hallway. The hot water in my sink was not working and I had to call the front desk 4 times (and demand that I speak to a manager) before someone came up and fixed it. Overall| not impressed with this hotel or the staff.,Sep 4| 2018,3,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

I was really disappointed in this Hilton.  I choose it based on the reviews| pictures| and its location.  The remote control for the TV was duct taped together| the shower was clogged| the furniture was shabby| and the mattresses were well worn and needed to be flipped or replaced. The door to the bathroom was in the style of the sliding barn doors but there wasn't a tract on the ground so when you tried to open/close the door| it was difficult due to the thickness of the carpet.  Also| because there wasn't said tract| it did not seal all of the way so there wasn't 100% privacy.,Aug 27| 2018,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

チェックインカウンターやサービスカウンターの人は笑顔で対応してくれたけれど、日本語対応となっているホテルだったので、ヒルトンに決めたのに日本語ができるスタッフ（チェックインカウンター、サービスカウンター）がおらず片言の英語でやり取りをした。また、ホテル内にあるスターバックスの店では後からレシートを確認すると、注文の数を間違えて計上していて、支払いが多くなっていた。英語のやり取りがうまくいかず注文数を間違えたのではなく、商品は頼んだ数量を渡してもらったので、店員さんの計上ミスだと後から気づいた。私がその時に気づけなかったのも落ち度があるが、がっかりした。,Aug 15| 2019,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Exelente Hotel muy cerca de Disney| que es lo que estabamos buscando| muy limpio| comodo| buen precio| personal muy atento| tuve la fortuna que me entregaran la habitación antes del chek in| llegamos temprano al hotel para entrar a Disney| nos asignaron la habitación y fue muy comodo el regreso ya con nuestras maletas dentro de la habitación| sin preocupación... a descansar!!Volveré!!!,Nov 21| 2018,5,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Trevligt Hotell men lite rörigt. Med tanke på hotellets storlek och antal rum är hisskapaciteten kraftigt underdimensionerad. Långa köer för att kunna ta hiss upp till rummet.,Nov 17| 2018,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Los cuartos ya están un poco viejos y con decoración anticuada| los baños podrían ser más grandes y cómodos| por otro lado está muy cerca de los parques y el bufete del desayuno es bueno.,Oct 20| 2018,4,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Todo iba bien hasta que encontramos un bicho en una de las camas| seguridad subió a verificar el bicho a pesar de que se había dejado la prueba en guest services| se solicito un reembolso o algún tipo de bonificación y solo nos dieron usd$25. Muy mala experiencia,Oct 19| 2018,2,Hilton Anaheim,777 W Convention Way| Anaheim| CA| 92802
