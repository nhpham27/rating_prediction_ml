The room was very clean and spacious.  We were able to see the Disneyland Resort fireworks.  The area was also quiet and we felt safe.,Aug 18| 2021,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Wow this was a great stay.  It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve had a positive hotel üè® experience.  The front desk staff made checking in very easy and the hotel is very kid-friendly.  The room was large| comfortable and very clean.  For what you pay| this hotel is an amazing value.  This will be my go-to when we visit disneyland,Aug 17| 2021,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
We had a great stay here at sun coast. Its a beautiful hotel. Nice pool area. The beds were comfy. Spacious suite. Staff friendly and attentive. Only downside was parking is not included in the price. I would recommend staying here.,Aug 17| 2021,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
So clean and beds are very comfortable| walking distance to Disneyland| parking is 24$ but that is reasonable for the location|  I felt safe with my kids at all times | and the room was exceptionally clean| staff is friendly I hope to stay here again !,Aug 16| 2021,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Horrible staff| horrible service. Mediocre hotel| cleanliness| and jacuzzi is always broken with towels never being restocked or issues never resolved. The location is great though?Spent over 2|000 dollars and a week stay‚Äî Mish (the ‚Äúmanager‚Äù) and Fernando who was the man that was up front to check us in and out| bad mouthed my husband and I when we voiced our concerns and unhappiness with the property. Manager did nothing while hearing how horrible we were talked to and offered no type of resolution.  we had to fight and call corporate (which took another few days and hours) to get THE MINIMUM type of compensation. All around waste of time when guests are treated so horribly. Wasted so much time of our stay trying to be heard and understood.,Aug 16| 2021,1,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
We were disappointed in the SunCoast Park Anaheim. We were ending a vacation with a stay near Disney to spend a day at the park. On hotels.com there are several options available for hotels in this price range in this location. What led me to select SC over the others was the Superb rating| the option to include breakfast at a reasonable price| and the availability of an area shuttle. Because we selected the brkfst upcharge| we were required to prepay the reservation; I do not know if this was a SC or H.com req. When we arrived late via taxi (which took a while to procure) b/c we were told the shuttle was not "reliable" at the late arrival time| we were told after checking in and after I asked about it| that breakfast was no longer being served at the hotel. Oh. And b/c we'd paid hotels.com| we would have to arrange refund through them. That was an hour and half process of calls| transfers| repeating saga| and so forth. To hotels.com credit| we did get a refund processed. It was just harder than it should have been.Still don't really know about the area shuttle options as the clerk found it too difficult to explain or provide info| and we decided to walk. Okay in the a.m.| would have like a ride home at night.The hotel itself was nice looking and stylish| but the accommodations were uncomfortable. In our 2Q room for three people| there was only one chair| and it was very uncomfortable. And the bedpillows were like sandbags| heavy and hard. The pool was nice.,Aug 16| 2021,3,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

We did an early check-in and had a pleasant experience because the early check-in fee was waived. Never had our beds made or anything like that| wasn't  made aware that we had to call for this service.The bar doesn't open on Sunday which is disappointing. Cocktails that the bar were good. Had microwave and fridge in the room which was nice. AC worked well. 24 hour desk which is nice| they have a store where they have food and some other little extra things which was nice| came in handy. Walking distance from Disneyland. Gas station| food| really AWESOME PLAZA right down the street; Amazing options for entertainment and food.,Aug 11| 2021,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Wont stay again. Very noisy ac unit. Food on the floor. Bed was nice. Minimal service| snack prices ridiculous. Was charged for 2 breakfast we didn't go to.

Everything was great except for the fact that they had a high school waterpolo and baseball group staying at the hotel. They were extremely loud and annoying throughout the night. My husband and I got hit with one of their balls on 2 different occasions while in the hot tub. No supervision at all. Not relaxing.

I booked two rooms for 3 nights to go visit Disneyland. When I was at the park at 10 pm I received a phone call from the hotel wondering if I wanted to extend my stay because I hadn't check out already and they had me in their system for 2 nights. I clarified my stay was for 3 nights since the beginning. I was then told I needed to go to the lobby to check in again| but not to worry because I didn't have to change rooms! This was a horrible experience because of course when I came into the hotel my kids were exhausted and falling asleep in the lobby and I had to go through the whole ordeal of paying a deposit of 100 again and getting new keys. They didn't even apologize for this experience. They told me I must have made different reservations for 2 and 1 night|  I said that was not the case| my reservations were for 3 nights since the beginning. By the way| they haven't even cleaned the room or picked up the trash in my whole stay. When they saw how unhappy I was with the experience they said: we are just the night crew. That's a terrible answer. This was my third stay at this hotel and I had recommended it to other people in the past. So disappointed with the bad service I received.,Jul 21| 2021,1,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

It‚Äôs a new hotel so it looks nice but don‚Äôt be fooled| I did not sleep at all. Kept waking up all night even 1am and 3 am because you can hear every little thing from all rooms around and hall ways. Even walking from above you hear it.

The hotel overall was pretty good| however the beds were hard as a rock| and the bathroom fan in my room didn't work. The telephone was spotty(loose rj11 connector on the wire). There was also one odd happening| had room service just come into our room about an hour or two after we checked in around 5pm with pizza boxes in hand. My wife and I looked at her and said| "Excuse me?" She left. We called the front desk and a supervisor| I assume came up to the room with new room keys| which not sure why it would make any bit of difference when housekeeping has a universal keycard| and told us the housekeeper thought the room was dirty and needed cleaning| which doesn't make much sense as to why she would come into a room with pizza| even if it was an empty box why come into a room with more trash? So| not that it's really a big issue or make me not want to consider staying here again| I thought it was noteworthy of mentioning. Overall though it was a good stay| wish Disney was doing their Fireworks| since we did pay extra for the Fireworks View room.,Jun 28| 2021,4,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Pool really large and kept at nice temperature.Was right near freeway so all the South facing rooms likely have the noise that we had and view of a vacant lot.Staff friendly and helpful.Was surprised by 2 items - 1| parking is an add on charge and not part of the room price and 2| Hilton does not give Honors points if you book via the agencies.,Jun 27| 2021,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

The hotel honored my booking which allowed us to check out 2 hours late.  Due to unusual circumstances they even extended that so we could check out 3 hours late.  They honored our booking benefits and gave us a $50 credit towards Disney gifts at the book shop.  The hotel has a nice pool and the facilities are clean.  The room was very spacious and clean.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.,Jun 27| 2021,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
We have stayed at this hotel multiple times and referred many friends and family. When we got to the hotel we were notified that they are no longer doing breakfast. I wish we were told prior so we can make arrangements. We got into our room and it seemed pretty clean| however it looked as if they missed vacuuming we had old cheese on the desk chair and some other debris including cotton with possible earwax or something on the ground and a used mask behind the toilet. We called the front desk they offered to switch our room but we just had unpacked everything. We asked if they can come and vacuum they said they would after two days of no one coming we asked again and they finally came and vacuumed. They didn‚Äôt offer to comp anything| but upon our Checkout I asked and with no question they comped our parking. We did love that the spa was open until 12am| so after a full day in the park we can go relax our bodies in the spa. Overall it‚Äôs a good hotel and this is the first time we really had any issues and we have been coming here for 5 plus years.,Jun 26| 2021,4,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
The hotel was nice| and staff was friendly and helpful. It was listed as having food available| but it did not while we were there. Parking was an extra $25/night. Internet was an extra charge of $50 for our stay. We weren‚Äôt told ahead of time| but room cleaning had to be scheduled with the front desk| it wasn‚Äôt just an automatic service. The hotel price range was not cheap| so I wasn‚Äôt expecting so many added charges| and lack of normal services included.,Jun 25| 2021,3,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Love the pool and jacuzzi. Beautiful lobby with great decor. Great beds. I enjoy staying here and it is close to Disneyland. I miss the breakfast and free parking. $24 per night for parking is too expensive. Would love it if they added a universal machine in the gym.,Jun 25| 2021,4,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Great hotel. Great room. Close to Disneyland.,Jun 25| 2021,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
The hotel overall was pretty good| however the beds were hard as a rock| and the bathroom fan in my room didn't work. The telephone was spotty(loose rj11 connector on the wire). There was also one odd happening| had room service just come into our room about an hour or two after we checked in around 5pm with pizza boxes in hand. My wife and I looked at her and said| "Excuse me?" She left. We called the front desk and a supervisor| I assume came up to the room with new room keys| which not sure why it would make any bit of difference when housekeeping has a universal keycard| and told us the housekeeper thought the room was dirty and needed cleaning| which doesn't make much sense as to why she would come into a room with pizza| even if it was an empty box why come into a room with more trash? So| not that it's really a big issue or make me not want to consider staying here again| I thought it was noteworthy of mentioning. Overall though it was a good stay| wish Disney was doing their Fireworks| since we did pay extra for the Fireworks View room.,Jun 28| 2021,4,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Great hotel and location!  I searched around for a while to find the best place to stay for our Disney trip. I had a hotel right across the street from the park booked| but received a notification that they don‚Äôt allow parking before check in or after check out‚Ä¶so I cancelled it and found this hotel. I‚Äôm glad I did!  This hotel is CLOSE!  Only a 5-7 minute walk with kiddos. The staff is friendly. It‚Äôs very clean. Wonderful overall. There is plenty of parking which is $25 per day| but it‚Äôs well worth it. You‚Äôll pay that at Disney| have to shuttle in| AND I heard that just to park at Disney takes about an hour. No thanks!  Definitely will be staying here again. Oh yeah| great pool and they even have a free laundry facility with nice machines.,Jun 18| 2021,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

My stay was relaxing. The staff was very accommodating too. The front staff person| Joey was very friendly and made us all feel so welcomed. I‚Äôve stayed at this hotel and quite enjoy my time here. It was not crowded at all and all Covid guidelines are being followed.The only con was that the pool was not heated. Other than that| everything was great. Also| I was interested in a late check out.

I was t able to check in my room until 8:30 pm because my room wasn‚Äôt ready I have never stayed somewhere and the room is not ready nice hotel just very inconvenient.,Sep 8| 2020,3,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
There was absolutely no parking available. When we checked in| we notified the people at the front desk| and that resulted in them having to give up their own spots due to the lack of parking spaces available. Then to add to it| they had no more rooms with king beds available| which is what we really wanted. I still took the room with 2 queen beds only because I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to get a refund. I was ready to ask for a refund when we realized there was a lack of parking! Oh well. Definitely not going to stay here again| that‚Äôs for sure. The room| however| was nice enough.,Sep 6| 2020,2,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
So arriving at the hotel| the front desk seemed a little weird. We asked him about the pool and he made it clear that it should only be us no outsiders. Which were just like ok? Because it really was my daughter and her father and I. So he gave us our room key and when we arrived to our room| he had given us a dirty room| the door was open and there was trash holding the door open (pizza boxes| empty soda bottles) so we assumed you‚Äôd sleeping hadn‚Äôt cleaned it yet. We went back down and he gave us another room. After that the room itself is amazing clean extremely spacious !! And the best part is the Pool!! It‚Äôs beautiful especially at night. The hallways were extremely muggy and gross and the front desk guy kept staring at us like if we were doing something bad which we weren‚Äôt| but other than that my daughter LOVED the pool and it was well worth it. Ps it does suck that they force you to pay for parking 26$ extremely expensive. They‚Äôre lucky the pool makes up for it other than that it wouldn‚Äôt be worth it.,Sep 4| 2020,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Booked Sun Coast because we were attending a show at the House of Blues. Location was absolutely perfect| it was less than a 10 minute walk right around the corner from the hotel. Check in was very easy| plenty of parking also a small underground parking lot. Took me maybe five minutes to check in. As for parking - I knew there was a fee| but didn‚Äôt think there would be tax too so total for one night was 19  dollars. Staff was very friendly and the hotel itself was very clean. The room was very nice and spacious. the king bed was sooo comfortable! The cabinet to the mini fridge was falling off but it worked so we didn‚Äôt care. Bathroom was clean and the room had a nice big tv. No complaints. Saw the pool from a distance looked very nice| didn‚Äôt use it though. Would definitely book here again! Also| we were on the 3rd floor facing the freeway and didn‚Äôt hear a single car!,Feb 24| 2020,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Clean rooms very convenient location to Disneyland. A few of the staff members were rude and the breakfast was not included as was originally advertised. Had to pay almost $5 per person but they didnt tell you this untill checkout and it wasnt worth the $5 even for the quality.,Feb 28| 2020,2,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

We've stayed at this hotel several times when it was Country Inn and loved it. It was close to Disneyland and the price was right. Parking was great and free (or included in the price). Since taken over by Hilton| prices doubled and now we had to pay for parking. Shame on me for not reading the fine print. The hotel staff did not  mention the parking fee when they handed me the card to put in the window. Unfortunately there was someone above us that was very noisy and seemed to be baving a football game in the room. We will be looking for our next favorite hotel now.,Feb 12| 2020,2,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Everything was great. Except one thing. There was an abundance of pre-teen boys. Running and and stomping throughout the 2nd and 3rd floors. There was no parental supervision. I had a few of these boys target my room door specifically. Playing pranks and running and yelling. It was very annoying and I found it hard to relax.,Feb 10| 2020,3,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Had a king room on 1st floor which made getting in/out very easy. Room was super comfortable and QUIET (especially for being adjacent to the freeway and on 1st floor). Breakfast was pretty basic for hot food (coffee| juice| eggs| bacon| sausage & waffles) but for the roughly $9 that they charge| you won‚Äôt find a better price for a sit-down breakfast.,Jan 30| 2020,4,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

This is a beautiful property and convenient to go to Disneyland. But I'm very sad that the previous owners| Country Inn| included free breakfast and parking and the new hotel does not. It's hard to justify going backwards in service and perks| especially when a hotel isn't right across the street from Disneyland.

It was a 2 day reservation but after the first night some how the house keeping department was told we should be checking out.  And even though there was a do not disturb sign on the door the knocked and tried to open the door twice before 10 am.  Then at 11:30 the Maintenance department came and unlocked the door and barged right int on the two of us.  Argued with me that we should be leaving.  That check out was at 11:00.  I told him that we had two night reservation.  He said he would go check again but that we should be out before he comes back.  I called the front desk and she confirmed that we had a two night reservation and none of that should have happened.  She was nice enough to  give me a $30 credit.  We later left the room for dinner and when we came back we were locked out of our room.  That sent me over the edge.  I asked to talk to a manager... there was non working on that Saturday night.   expected to hear from a manager before we left Sunday.  I heard anything from anyone.,Jan 14| 2020,2,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

We stayed 4 nights because we could find nothing else after night one.  The traffic from Interstate 5 is so loud.  They have me earplugs but hard to sleep since I don‚Äôt use them at home.  The night before we went to bar for drink but bartender knew nothing about the beer on tap.  Another hitch washing free breakfast.  It was marketed as such but they said the policy changed and that was ridiculous.   So no it should not be rated as high.

The hotel is 15 minutes walking distance to Disneyland. Our room was studio type| very clean| and really big for 4 adults| 1 king size bed and double sofa bed. The bed was comfortable. The hotel was newly refurbished with new carpet and nice furnitures. It is now under Hilton. The WiFi was good. The aircon was quiet and efficient. The bathroom was big with strong hot shower. Although it was near the highway it was quiet. At the end of the corridor| you can see the Ferris wheel of the Disney Adventure Park. We didn‚Äôt have the time to use the pool and the gym. Ellie at the reception was friendly and efficient in managing our concerns| like defective faucet in the bathroom sink and provided us toiletries when I asked since only 1 set was given for 4 of us. Take note that there is parking fee to pay now. There is shuttle to Disneyland if you would like to use it for a fee per person per day. Overall| I highly recommend this hotel.

This property has recently been renovated and the service is excellent. I found everything I needed there and if I had a question that was answered quickly. I was very surprised because I was exhausted tonight I got there and the maintenance man even went above and beyond and went and picked up my mail for me at the bar. I would stay here in a heartbeat,Dec 7| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Mish the front desk woman was amazing! The staff was quick to change rooms since the AC was out in our original room. Great experience,Dec 9| 2019,4,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Hotel was clean and comfortable. Large beautiful pool and hot tub.  Includes Breakfast was great| lots of options. Staff was very friendly!

This was a perfect location to walk to the parks| and the complimentary breakfast had robust and delicious options to please just about anyone. Parking was also complimentary. All around| this was an excellent option if you don't want to pay the premium to stay on-site. Additionally| aside from the Grand California| this hotel is probably a shorter walk to the park entrances.,Nov 25| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Wifi was spotty room was noisy with the traffic noises through the night .... bathroom door doesnt have a latch which is very inconvenient for families with small kids breakfast was good and  bed was comfy,Nov 25| 2019,3,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
It was an interesting stay at the property. I was smacked in the middle of the switch. So it was a little confusing what was going on. I wish they had a way of contacting me letting me know the switch was going to occur prior to us coming. Every night we had to get new card keys because of the transition. Which was slightly annoying. But the breakfast was still the same and tasty. Customer service was still nice. Maria was a friendly face at breakfast. The theming is the new resort is so weird because it‚Äôs not near Huntington Beach| or any water for that matter. But I‚Äôll embrace the new change. I just hope breakfast and parking is included in the price after this change!,Nov 23| 2019,4,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

The property| staff| and amenities are excellent. We were able to check in early| which was super convenient with having a toddler and going to Disney. The complimentary buffet breakfast had all of the essentials: cereal| oatmeal| waffles| toast| eggs| sausage| fruit| yogurt| juices| coffee| & tea. The only small downside is that breakfast ends pretty early at 9:30am. The entire hotel including the room were upgraded and clean. Parking was free and lot was large. The main reason we booked here was the close walking proximity to Disneyland| which was a less than a fifteen minute walk. I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend to anyone considering a hotel near Disney or in the Anaheim area. House of blues and many other eateries are right across the street. The convenience store at the hotel has items in case you forget toiletries or want a snack. Also| Mish the front desk manager was excellent and friendly both during check in and check out.

Hotel was going through a bit of a remodel. Which is ok.

There was road construction going on next to the hotel| so getting TO and INTO the hotel was challenging and very frustrating as there was no signage to direct us nor was there any notification from the hotel to alert us prior to checking in. Once inside the hotel| we were pleasantly surprised by how nice it was. The room itself was really nice| spacious & super clean| but the noise level from the freeway made it an uncomfortable and restless night. I really do believe that the rooms facing the freeway should have better noise insulation. The breakfast was okay and with the exception of scrambled eggs and yogurt| offered the usual carb and sugar laden items most children crave. The breakfast area was kept clean and the staff was very nice. The proximity to Disneyland and not paying Disneyland hotel prices was the reason for choosing this hotel and we would stay here again for that reason| but would request a room away from the freeway. We walked to and from Disneyland and loved that we didn't have to pay extra for parking!,Oct 30| 2019,4,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

This is a clean and recently updated hotel. The hot breakfast was great with a variety for picky eaters and the dining staff was very pleasant. The theme park shuttle was convenient| but it is also close enough to walk. My only complaint would be that they advertised (and I booked) a room with 2 QUEEN sized beds. They were more the size of DOUBLE beds. Upon check out| when I was asked how my stay was| I mentioned this to the gal and expressed how disappointing this was since we did not get the rest we needed having 2 adults in such a small bed. She responded that they are not the "California Queen" beds that I may be used to| but that they are a "Standard Queen" that most hotels have. I travel seven months out of the year| and have NEVER heard of such a thing. This left a bad taste in my mouth for an otherwise nice stay.,Oct 28| 2019,4,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

The room was huge and very clean.  There was a microwave| mini fridge and coffeemaker.  It was a short walk to Disney but we used Lufthansa| because after walking all day that short walk was not fun.  The hotel doesn‚Äôt offer a shuttle but there is one you can buy tickets for that stops at the hotel.

We had to stay in a different (backup) hotel they had for us on our first night because of a plumbing issue| but that was free so we were okay with it. They were very accommodating and kind. The hotel had electric charging lots for us to charge our Tesla| the room they upgraded us to because of the plumbing thing was very nice| the breakfast was awesome| the pool is nice and the staff are great. 15 minutes to walk to Disneyland,Oct 15| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Our family stay at the Country inn & Suites was very enjoyable. A 15 minute walk to the Parks made it easy to return during the day and rest. The breakfast was excellent and plentiful. Play room next to the breakfast area is a great idea for the kids! Free parking| breakfast| and WiFi made it the best choice for our family.,Oct 15| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Hotel was nice and clean. Only issue was with shower  valve. So hard to pull up for shower seemed old or stuck.  Even more difficult if it was wet. Bad choice for design.

great hotel with great location,Oct 21| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Good breakfast to fuel up for Disney or whatever the days adventures. Friendly and helpful staff. Rooms are decent sized. Walking distance to Disney.,Oct 19| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
The staff was friendly and attentive. The room was very clean and nicely decorated. The pool was great for the kids and the breakfast was good| but not great. I would stay here again for our next Disneyland vacation.,Oct 18| 2019,4,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
The room was huge and very clean.  There was a microwave| mini fridge and coffeemaker.  It was a short walk to Disney but we used Lufthansa| because after walking all day that short walk was not fun.  The hotel doesn‚Äôt offer a shuttle but there is one you can buy tickets for that stops at the hotel.  The breakfast was fantastic lots of choices| cereal| oatmeal| waffles| eggs| sausage| biscuits and gravel| etc.,Oct 18| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

We had to stay in a different (backup) hotel they had for us on our first night because of a plumbing issue| but that was free so we were okay with it. They were very accommodating and kind. The hotel had electric charging lots for us to charge our Tesla| the room they upgraded us to because of the plumbing thing was very nice| the breakfast was awesome| the pool is nice and the staff are great. 15 minutes to walk to Disneyland,Oct 15| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Our family stay at the Country inn & Suites was very enjoyable. A 15 minute walk to the Parks made it easy to return during the day and rest. The breakfast was excellent and plentiful. Play room next to the breakfast area is a great idea for the kids! Free parking| breakfast| and WiFi made it the best choice for our family.,Oct 15| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Hotel was nice and clean. Only issue was with shower  valve. So hard to pull up for shower seemed old or stuck.  Even more difficult if it was wet. Bad choice for design.

Top property that‚Äôs super modern and is basically a new property so feels clean and fresh and is only 10-15 min walk to Disneyland with a cheap $7 taxi ride home if your feeling tied :) highly recommended,Sep 26| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
When I booked this hotel I never thought I would be saying this but my stay here was nothing but disappointment. Staff ignored my request for a specific room upon check in. Hotel was undergoing construction that was never mentioned. Noise started before 8am so it was impossible to rest. Room was on the side of freeway and was very noisy also. Would not recommend this hotel and will never stay here again.,Sep 24| 2019,1,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
It was close enough to Disneyland that we could easily walk to the park but also had transit available. The rooms were very comfortable and spacious. The Bistro did not provide room service and unfortunately we had to wait about 50 mins for the only person working to return from break so we could order a meal. Then we had to return later to pick it up.Bre Evans at the front desk was super helpful and friendly and made our  stay pleasant from the onset!,Sep 24| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Disappointing.   Upon check in the sliding barn door for the bathroom was broken.  Screws were missing form the top. The door would barely budge.  We booked this room because they listed cribs in their description.  We asked for a crib| a pack n play showed up. Which our 1 year old can't sleep in.  After a very long night of no sleep| I checked with the front desk again| they said they would send crib. After 2 pm I checked again| which they said they can't give me one.   On leaving to the park on the second day I took our do not disturb off.  Seeing the cleaning lady in the hallway and hearing her ask another guest if she would like service I assumed she was going to clean our room.  As she was directly across the hallway.   We came back 6 hours and it wasn't cleaned. Leaving dirty dishes| diapers and trash in our room all day made for a smelly return.  I went back to desk again and asked for service.  2 hours went by|  I took all the dishes out myself| ran into front desk in the hallway with hand full of dishes and they just kept walking..   At this point expecting another sleepless night we decided to go back home.  When I approached the front again I said we wanted to check out.  She asked about our stay and I said it was TERRIBLE|  she looked at my account and said oh you prepaid.  I guess that's it.   After having so many problems and not once did they say "sorry" I felt disgusted about my families experience staying here.  My recourse is to leave this response..,Sep 23| 2019,1,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Had a great stay here. Everyone we encountered was amazing but especially Hallie at the front desk. She made check-in and check-out easy and was amazing to work with.,Sep 22| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Loved the pool!!! My only complaint is the beds were to hard for my comfort. Besides that| the staff was exceptional| the property was immaculate| there was a great grab and go store. Loved that the safe was larger than the customary hotel safe!  Would definitely recommend this resort although I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôd stay here again because of the hard beds.

Great staff! Great location! Great price!!!It was so convenient in getting to Disneyland and easy access to the freeway. The staff were so courteous| welcoming| and helpful.

Staff| rooms and the pool were great! We had a nice stay.,Aug 30| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
We enjoyed our stay at this hotel| and would definitely stay here again and refer our friends & family here. The property is modern| clean and family-friendly. The staff was great| and each staff member we engaged with throughout our stay was friendly| helpful and service-oriented. Great pool and amenities| and we enjoyed the complimentary breakfast each morning| in addition to fresh baked cookies in the lobby. Although the location is close enough to walk to the Disneyland| we elected to use the shuttle which was super convenient with a little one. Layout of lobby entrance| dining area and hotel room is modern and spacious. Great place to stay while visiting Disneyland!,Aug 29| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

All of the staff were very pleasant and accommodating. The pool and jacuzzi was clean| not overcrowded and the jacuzzi was actually hot. It was wonderful. Most impressive was the ability of the staff to maintain an outstanding well stocked breakfast buffet with good food quality for the number of guest coming through a 31/2 hour timeframe. You couldn't ask for more for an all inclusive complimentary buffet. I will definitely return on my next visit to Disneyland.,Jul 31| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Pool area is great though they need to limit people bringing their own sound system.  That same group got a little out of hand.  The room is extraordinary| huge! Stroll to Disneyland.  We went to American Sports Center| a short 13 min walk.  Close to all.  Would definitely come again.  Check in was a bit of a challenge when people are buying Disney passes.  There is not a dedicated front desk person so you have to wait and the group before us had an excessive amount of questions.,Jul 22| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

They could do with more than 10 pool recliners considering the size of the complex. Also they leave you cardboard cups no glasses for use in the room. Not environmentally friendly or nice to use.

The staff was incredibly friendly.  The facilities were clean| and the location was an easy walk to Disneyland.  The kids loved the pool.  The food was good| and free guest parking was a plus.  We plan to stay at this hotel again on our next trip to Disneyland.  A+++++++,Jul 18| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Great view of Disneyland fireworks from hallway glass wall!  Check in was smooth & the front desk attendant was very helpful & cheerful.  Our room was clean| beds were comfortable for queens| bath room was nice & big with plenty of towels. Breakfast was good with a nice assortment. Pool looked refreshing but we did not get a chance to enjoy it. We were pleasantly surprised at how quiet it was considering there was a large group of youth for a Basket event| if you went by noise alone you would hardly new they were there. The food from the Cafe/Bar was pretty good & nice that it could be ordered as take out..Only complaints are: our room AC made quite loud whirling sound & the "kids room" was just 4 oversize pillows & a TV| that was disappointing since our grandchildren were not going Disneyland that left little to do for them.,Jul 18| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

We enjoyed our 6 nights in the hotel. It‚Äôs very new and fresh. We only had breakfast 2-3 mornings & found it to be average. The nice part is there‚Äôs plenty of seating. The pool and hot tub were well kept. You can see DL fireworks from the pool| but not the hot tub. We ordered pizza from the Bistro one night and it was good| just wish it was open before 5:00. Market had good options for munchies. Parking spaces are in short supply| but we always managed to find the last spot. Based on the number of times we shared the elevator with employees| I‚Äôd guess there‚Äôs no service elevator or employee parking. Prior to our stay| I remember reading a review calling the rooms ‚Äúspacious|‚Äù but I don‚Äôt agree. They were nice| clean| and beds were comfy. It was great having a fridge| microwave| and coffee maker in the room. The one thing they were desperately missing is towel racks or hooks to put towels on. We had to get creative and hang towels over the hard furniture. We left around 1:00 pm one day and never got a cleaning so we definitely had to figure out how to dry all of the towels. The area is super close to DL| but we chose to drive each day to avoid the end-of-night exhaustion. It‚Äôs across the street from the Garden Walk| which is kind of a downtown Disney knockoff. The one thing I hated was the freeway noise while trying to sleep| especially because I‚Äôd asked for a quiet room. We couldn‚Äôt hear other guests though!,Jun 27| 2019,4,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

This place has the biggest pool at a hotel that I have seen in the LA-Long Beach-Anaheim area. One end is fairly shallow| so if you are swimming laps at 6:00am (yes| the pool is open then)| you may have to swim on your back at that end. May not be able to swim laps at other times of the day. The rooms and bed are nice and comfortable. Shower was fine. Breakfast has both a 4-small waffle maker and a 1-large waffle maker. They seem to alternate between sausage and bacon. The had hash browns like diced potatoes| and like McD's. Wasn't keen on the canned fruit for yogurt. The desk has cookies. You can watch the Disney fireworks at night from the end of the hallways. The food from the bar area is pretty good| too.,Jun 27| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

I cancel my reservation in a different hotel because I read great reviews about this hotel and I don‚Äôt regretted at all. This hotel is very close to Disneyland (about 15 min walking with kids)| rooms are huge and everything looks new| free breakfast with a lot of options| the coffee is great!!! And they have free cookies| a variety of teas and hot chocolate also for free after 3pm. You can relax in the swimming and jacuzzi which open until 12am. Or you can just watch the fireworks from there every night at 9.30pm. We stay 7 days and we really had great experience. I don‚Äôt think you can get free parking| free breakfast| free WiFi in any other brand knew hotel for the same price. Price is great for all you can get here. They have a bar with a kids corner so you can drink and have fun while your kids are watching a movie next to you. They also have a restaurant but they close at 10pm. I just tried the pesto chicken pizza and my kids love it. My only suggestion is to put locks in the bathrooms| usually I hide from my kids there :) but bathrooms have only a slide door without locks and everytime I was using the bathroom kids open the door. Special shoutout for Maria| last day at the hotel I woke up late and missed the breakfast| Maria was so nice and made me a coffee since I can‚Äôt start my day without coffee. You made my day Maria!!! I highly recommend this hotel!!! And for sure I‚Äôll be back soon.,Jun 22| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Nina at check in was outstanding!!! I must say| I‚Äôm one of those crazy ‚Äúgermaphobes‚Äù if you will and this hotel definitely made the cut! I was so surprised at how clean the beds were... they even have bed bug protectors on their mattresses! Enough about that... breakfast was a great start with healthy options and a great start to our day! I was able to drink my wine and also take some to the room without having to find a convenience store!The walk to Disney is about 10 minutes and super convenient! Overall| I‚Äôm a pretty tough critic and this place has a great staff| it‚Äôs classy and affordable!

Nina at check in was outstanding!!! I must say| I‚Äôm one of those crazy ‚Äúgermaphobes‚Äù if you will and this hotel definitely made the cut! I was so surprised at how clean the beds were... they even have bed bug protectors on their mattresses! Enough about that... breakfast was a great start with healthy options and a great start to our day! I was able to drink my wine and also take some to the room without having to find a convenience store!The walk to Disney is about 10 minutes and super convenient! Overall| I‚Äôm a pretty tough critic and this place has a great staff| it‚Äôs classy and affordable!

New hotel| so it's very nice and clean. Rooms are spacious. Pool was nice and big and temperature was quite warm. Good selection at breakfast| and we did utilize the bar a couple of evenings while the kids swam or watched a movie in the movie room next door. Only issue we had was the (free) washing machine stopped working in the middle of a load which was kind of an inconvenience.Very walkable to Disneyland (about 10 min)| or there is a shuttle that comes by every 20 minutes.  Lots of restaurant selection very close by also.  Would definitely recommend this hotel.,May 8| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

This location is a stone throw away from Disney Land. More than once we just watched the fireworks from our hallway window. The facilities are new and clean| absolutely worth it. Only things I wish would improve:- Hot tub jets are nearly useless in pressure.- Shower water pressure was absolutely terrible. It has been by far the worst shower experience I've had.,May 5| 2019,4,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights with my 2 kids as we were visiting Disneyland. What we really liked: very clean premises| modern style| friendly staff| very comfortable king bed (the sofa bed didn‚Äôt look as comfortable but my kid still slept like a log in it)| spacious and quiet room (all rooms may not be as quiet as some may be facing the highway)| free breakfast with plenty of options and pleasant dining room| free parking right in front of hotel (not in a remote lot| you can access your car at all times without asking a valet)| nice swimming pool (half of it is shallow enough for a 5 year old to walk so non swimmers can still have plenty of fun| water was clean and warm)| perfect location (13 minute walk to Disney security gate at a 5 year old pace| including 2 light crossings!)| convenient bistro in the evening offering pizzas to the kids‚Äô delight and with friendly server who poured me a very generous glass of wine :-) The only thing I would improve: add racks and hooks to hang towels in the bathroom! Our room only had 1 hook and it was above the bathtub... So we ended up drying our towels on the chairs and housekeeping replaced them every day| which was a waste. Overall| this is our fourth Disney trip| we booked different hotels on each trip and this is my favorite so far!,Apr 30| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Highly recommend watching the fireworks from there!They let us have a later check out which was lovely as their was ability to do this that day.

We got the king suite it was super spacious and loved having the couch that turned into a bed for the kids. The pool was heated so it was nice when it was a windy day. And the free breakfast was amazing! They had so many choices to choose from. They keep it super clean! Disneyland was super close they do have a shuttle service provided by the city you just have to pay a small amount to use it| they give you all that info at the desk. You could also walk their| we just drove it was no more than a 5 min drive.

I   liked everything about this hotel and so did the other 11 people I   travelled with. Walking distance to Disney and some great restaurants. (Cheesecake Factory and PF Changs) Swimming pool and jacuzzi open until midnight. Complimentary cookies| coffee and tea in the lobby area in the evening. Free washer and dryers bring your own soap or buy it in the gift shop. Great variety of fruit and food to eat in their complimentary breakfast. Very friendly and helpful staff and clean and comfortable rooms. You can see the fireworks from outside their hotel| inside at the large windows at the end of the hallways or inside the pool!,Apr 9| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

This hotel is only a 14 minute walk to Disneyland. Along the way| there are many other great restaurants which makes it very convenient for kids. Breakfast selection was great! Staff was amazingly friendly and accommodating. The hotel was very open| modern and clean. The pool hours were great; and even better that you can see fireworks on the pool deck.

I wish there were some type of ventilation in the room other than the AC unit. Windows don't open and bathroom fan didn't appear to do much| the room felt musty and too humid. The AC unit smelled seriously musty when it turned on. The dishes for breakfast were often dirty| I would pick up at least three dirty mugs before finding a clean one for coffee.

Our family of four stayed here for our trip to Disneyland (5 nights) over spring break.  All staff was always friendly and more than willing to accommodate.  From front desk to maids/maintenance| all were friendly.Rooms were very spacious| clean and up to date.  Little to no noise from hallways/neighboring rooms as well.  Beds were comfy.  Bathroom was large.Free breakfast was key for the trip.  Plenty of options (also 3 waffle makers).  Didn‚Äôt make it to lobby bar| but looked fully stocked with the essentials and a happy hour.Pool and hot tub were amazing.  Both very big and pool was heated.  During our afternoon breaks from Disney| often had entire pool to ourselves.About 10 minute walk to front gates at Disneyland.  We also elected to get a bus pass for the ART (Anaheim Resorts Transportation) which comes into parking lot.  Simple 5-10 minute ride which was nice when we were already walking 8-10 miles a day in the parks with young kids.Would definitely stay here again if in the area.,Apr 6| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Fernando at the front desk was argumentative and lacking basic customer service skills.  Furniture in the king suite isn't as pictured online.  Housekeeping was hit or miss| forgetting to restock shampoo| washcloths| coffee| cups| tissues| etc.  Pool towels are tiny| thin| threadbare| and never fully stocked.  Pool area lacks enough umbrellas and furniture.,Apr 6| 2019,3,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Great location for Disneyland| 10 minute walk.  Hotel has 2 chargers using the SemaConnect but one is in a handicapped spot?....the other is accessible via 2 stalls which is nice.   Charging is free but slow.  Pool is heated and the restaurant has good eats and drinks.  Room cleaning was just ok.,Apr 5| 2019,4,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
I   liked everything about this hotel and so did the other 11 people I   travelled with. Walking distance to Disney and some great restaurants. (Cheesecake Factory and PF Changs) Swimming pool and jacuzzi open until midnight. Complimentary cookies| coffee and tea in the lobby area in the evening. Free washer and dryers bring your own soap or buy it in the gift shop. Great variety of fruit and food to eat in their complimentary breakfast. Very friendly and helpful staff and clean and comfortable rooms. You can see the fireworks from outside their hotel| inside at the large windows at the end of the hallways or inside the pool!,Apr 9| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
AMAZING experience from check in to checkout! Great location| great service a short walk to Garden Walk restaurants and Disneyland| honestly cannot say enough good things about this hotel! We will be back üòä,Apr 9| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
This hotel is only a 14 minute walk to Disneyland. Along the way| there are many other great restaurants which makes it very convenient for kids. Breakfast selection was great! Staff was amazingly friendly and accommodating. The hotel was very open| modern and clean. The pool hours were great; and even better that you can see fireworks on the pool deck. I would recommend this for any family travelling to Disney.,Apr 9| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

I wish there were some type of ventilation in the room other than the AC unit. Windows don't open and bathroom fan didn't appear to do much| the room felt musty and too humid. The AC unit smelled seriously musty when it turned on. The dishes for breakfast were often dirty| I would pick up at least three dirty mugs before finding a clean one for coffee. The bed was comfortable and the employees were very kind and helpful.,Apr 8| 2019,3,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

10-15 minute walk to Disneyland.  Quiet building| clean room| friendly staff.  I wish we had known we were getting an ADA room prior to our visit.  Because it was an ADA room water got on a good portion of the bathroom floor and I had to wipe floor every time we took a shower.

So many nice reviews and they didnt disappoint.  We showed up before check-in and were able to get a room| the breakfast was nice and they kept stocking it. At somepoint a transient got in the building  attempted to go into the breakfast area and security/management came out of nowhere and removed him quick without a commotion in less than a minute| out of the 40 people there I think only 5 of us noticed what transpired.

I booked this property based on reviews of other customers and we were not disappointed. The room was new| clean and quiet.  The walk from our room to the Disneyland gates was right at 15 minutes.   As others have stated| the free breakfast is second to none. I was astonished| hot eggs| bacon| sausage| fresh fruit| biscuits and gravy| granola and yogurt| cottage cheese| and a waffle station and more.  I would not hesitate to stay here again .,Mar 1| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

We had a perfect stay at the country inn!! They allowed us to check in early because there was a room available. They brought a crib up to the room right away| at no charge. So nice! The breakfast was delicious. Loved the brownie brittle in the gift shop. :),Mar 3| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Good hotel| free breakfast was very nice with a good selection. 10-15 minute walk to Disney which is shorter than waiting in the bus queues.,Mar 1| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

We were on a family trip to Disneyland and this hotel was a HIGHLIGHT!The staff was super nice| and the place looked clean and new!The included breakfast was a big hit with everyone as well as the heated pool and hot tub!We elected a ‚Äúsuite‚Äù with separated sitting area| it had a pull out couch and became the kids ‚Äúroom‚Äù and gave enough separation for us to watch some tv at night without disturbing anyone‚Äôs sleep!Having a refrigerator and microwave was a huge help to have late night snacks as we would wind down from the parks.We rented a car to explore Hollywood a couple days and the free parking was a convienence! (Though if you are just going to Disney the walk is minimal| we could see a lot of the park from our room!)If I had to pick a ‚Äúnegative‚Äù... and this is a stretch... the cookies that are ‚Äúavailable‚Äù in the lobby 24/7 seemed to run out very quickly and a few times the younger ones were a little disappointed that there were none.,Feb 23| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
I really like this hotel. You can use Disney land shuttle  bus if you pay $5 (1day pass). Also hotel has a swimming pool. I like this hotel's lobby.

Family trip to Disneyland (2 adults| 2 kids ages 10 and 15). We stayed one night. Check- in was quick and easy| very friendly front-desk staff. We were happy to see and enjoy the warm chocolate chip cookies at check-in. The room was a good size| everything was clean| beds were comfortable. Breakfast was plentiful and everything was clean| but the food was just OK overall. Make-your-own waffles were good| but powdered scrambled eggs and cut-up fruit that had an off-taste were not. Oatmeal was fine. The best part was that we didn‚Äôt have to wait for food despite the large group of people present. We left our bags in the locked room behind the front desk for the day| and had no problem picking everything up at the end of the day. We took a Lyft ride to Disneyland in the morning| but were fine walking back at the end of the day.,Feb 22| 2019,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Nice| new hotel with clean rooms. Great pool with a hot tub. I stayed in a king suite and the room is huge| in fact its so big it actually feels like there is furniture missing in the area between the bed and the window and it does create a bit of wasted space but if you need the extra room for a couple cots or something it would be more than enough. Central to the Disney resort area| within 5-10 minutes walking distance of many restaurants| Disney parks and Downtown Disney. Cons: close to I-5 so a bit of noise from the freeway comes through but it's not bad it just adds a bit of white noise. While this can be seen as a con| it can also be seen as a pro as it has very quick access to the freeway if you need it (which I did for my business trip). Also the breakfast was not very good; runny/soggy liquid eggs| soggy sausages| greasy bacon| the only items I ended up eating were the waffles (fresh self-serve waffle maker) and yogurt but there are other items like cereal| toast| other baked goods and juice.,Feb 21| 2019,4,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Nice rooms| comfy beds and very friendly staff. Not very spacious| but to be honest| you don't go here to spend much time in your room. The pool and spa are fabulous (though way too much chlorine - bring your goggles if you want to swim)| the wi-fi is pretty good throughout the hotel| and there seems to be plenty of parking available. The breakfast is good| but not great - if you don't get in early| the best of the fruit and other items will be gone and the scraps left over are not always appealing.The bar has a reasonable array of food available for evening meals| and the pizza is really good.As for the negatives| the US$17 resort fee (plus at least $3 tax) is a real scam and should be included in the up front price of the room. It's not "free wifi| parking and breakfast". It is wi-fi| parking and breakfast included for US$20 per night. Look closely at the fine print to find it. The towels are horrible (I have worked in hospitals with nicer towels). They feel old| hard and crusty| plus the pool towels are ridiculously small and threadbare. And there are only two washing machines and dryers for the entire hotel| which is nowhere near enough.I do feel this is a better option than some of the older hotels in the area and much better value than the Disney hotels. Uber trips to Disneyland can be had for $6-8 plus tips| and arrive at the hotel within minutes of booking| so for a few more dollars| it is worth the additional cost.,Feb 16| 2019,4,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Great property. Clean| modern looking. Free breakfast was good. They said it would be a 15 minute walk to Disney front gate. I would say it was closer to a ten minute walk.

Is it how the expensive charge hotel cost me over $1|000 for 4 nights to give me that kind the answer?I didn‚Äôt stay at 1-2 stars hotel rating did I?  So I‚Äôm not allowed to say what is not going well for me.  I said it after I checked out meaning I paid all the price already so what lame do the staffs have to face up with the customer!,Jan 2| 2019,4,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Weekend trip to DL with kids. Room was a suite with 1 king and full sleeper sofa. Bed was comfortable| but sleeper sofa was horrible. Mattress was very thin with spring poking and noisy if you moved at all. If I knew that before hand would have hot 2 queens to be more comfortable. Room was clean and spacious with a nice size fridge & microwave. Was able to grab mac n cheese and drinks in small shop on main floor. Did not get breakfast do it it being crowded both mornings at 7 am. Walk to park is 15-20 minutes but after a long day| we took bus back. You have to wait 20 minutes| but our feet didn't care they weren't walking another step. Staff was friendly and was easy to get towels| etc when needed. Noise level was not over whelming except when complete silent in room. You then could hear EVERYTHING from rooms above and next door. Parking was easy and plenty of spaces. They charge a resort fee which is not included in your payments to Hotels.com. The food places are all on Harbor so if you will need to eat on way in or out of DL or grab a snack in shop downstairs. One thing that bothered us and almost ruined our day at DL is the power saving. If you plug your phone in on a wall controlled by power saving outlet it WILL NOT charge. Made that mistake first night and luckily my daughter's phone did charge and we could use for DL app and tickets. Overall nice| clean hotel but I would say we won't stay again for DL trip| maybe a trip for a game at ball field.,Dec 30| 2018,4,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Hotel was good. Great location to disney. Uber was about 5 bucks but you can definately walk.  Eggs could have been cooked a little longer though. Bed was not comfy| felt like sleeping on cement.

This property is quite new and within easy and safe walking distance of Disneyland. It also has (paid) bus service to and from the park. The suites are spacious and good for families. The water pressure in the bathroom is lacking a bit and| despite the encouragement to reuse towels| there are no towel bars available to dry things in the bathroom. The daily breakfast is really lovely. We had variation for the first two days and then a very similar spread for the latter four days. The pool is very nice and has long hours. The service staff addressed some deficiencies in our room quickly (e.g.| dirty towels when we arrived and fridge not working). The staff were also very friendly. We would likely stay here again. The value for the price is very good.,Dec 17| 2018,4,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Great stay. Frequent shuttle to get to Disneyland was available for low cost or we were also able to take a quick 10 minute walk. Great breakfast with lots of healthy options!

The whole staff was so friendly. They have excellent customer service all around from the front desk| cleaning staff and even the guys who works the continental breakfast lobby. It‚Äôs really nice and clean. The king size suite we had was nice and spacious. Our kids loved the sofa bed and loved that they had their own tv too. The breakfast in the morning was actually pretty good. A lot better then all the other continental breakfast. They actually had hot food like eggs| sausage| bacon and potatoes. Along with the usual waffles| toast| English muffins| oatmeal| cereal| fruit| yogurt| and different juices. They even had free cookies at the check in counter. And always had a selection of coffee| tea and hot coco in the lobby. The salt water heated pool was a plus for my boys. The fact that they got to swim at night after we got back from the park made them excited. It was a really big pool| heated and it opened til midnight. Overall I would highly recommend this place to others who don‚Äôt mind walking 10-12 mins or ride the ART to the park.

Breakfast is quite basic| but good enough to get something before you are off and running.  Food menu in the bar was limited| but did the trick when we took a brief break from the parks to eat and change to warmer clothes for the evening.

Complementary tea| coffee| and hot chocolate all day was a nice bonus.  Parking| WiFi| and breakfast are all included. Breakfast is quite basic| but good enough to get something before you are off and running.  Food menu in the bar was limited| but did the trick when we took a brief break from the parks to eat and change to warmer clothes for the evening.   We didn‚Äôt use the pool| but were surprised how large and nice it was.  Staff was friendly and helpful and the room was a decent size| modern| and clean. We would absolutely stay here again when visiting Disney.,Nov 21| 2018,4,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Everything was great. We went to Disneyland waking! The breakfast has a lot of things to eat.,Nov 20| 2018,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

This is not a resort but charges resort fees daily.  No service upon arrival| no help with luggage| no help with parking or shuttle information.  No local information or hotel information in the room.  Towels and toiletries are not resort quality and not enough provided for 4 people each day.,Nov 19| 2018,3,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Our room was clean and relatively quiet. Noise from neighbors was minimal| though freeway traffic nearby provided white noise at night. Bath amenities were on the skimpy side| considering the price of the room. Only one set of shampoo/conditioner for a two-night stay for three people. Guest bar soaps were tiny and towels were small and scratchy. Overall| it was decent enough for our needs. Complimentary breakfast was good. No room service. Just glad it was clean.,Nov 16| 2018,4,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
The hotel was amazing. Everything is always great at the hotel only minor setback would be the parking and the staff. Staff seems a little ‚Äúoccupied‚Äù with other things than attend to the guests needs. I waited at the counter for about 10 minutes before they helped me while they were seemingly putting stuff away. Not cool. But other than that the hotel is always great,Nov 15| 2018,4,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Visiting Disneyland for 3 days.  The hotel is a 10 minute walk from Disneyland| short enough to leave the car parked in the parking lot and walk the way there.  The free breakfast was very good and the eating area was very large.  The pool and hottub were great and open late - the perfect way to rest your sore feet after a long day of walking.The room itself was very good. Spacious| with a bar fridge and microwave.

Our first time to disneyland and we wanted a nice hotel that wouldnt break our budget| we were not disappointed. First of all the location is great. 3 blocks away from the front gate of disney. House of blues a block away| delicious pizza at "the pizza press" 2 blocks down. The breakfast buffet was the best I've ever had at a hotel...waffles|sausage|bacon|eggs|hashbrowns etc. The pool and hot tub are open till midnight and there is a nice little bar downstairs as well. We will not hesitate to stay here again. Loved it!,Nov 9| 2018,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Quick to help| quick to clean up a breakfast table| friendly housekeepers.  We highly recommend this stay.  You truly CAN walk to Disneyland with little ones from here!

The hotel must be newly renovated. It is very clean| and spacious. You could do multiple cartwheels in our king junior suite room (I did). My only complaint| and it is one that I have experienced at other hotels is the water pressure| and hot water. Not always super consistent| but never cold. I had a tepid bath one night.Hot breakfast buffet is a bonus. You can make mini waffles| and toast| and each morning had eggs| fruit| and a meat (bacon one day| sausage another)| along with a selection of cereals| hot oatmeal| and hashbrowns/tater tots. If you're there for Disney| then having a big breakfast like this is a GREAT way to start off your day and keep you full. Disney eats are expensive.

Pros: The room was very large and had plenty of space. The breakfast was good for a free breakfast but was pretty much the same everyday with maybe one thing different.

My family and I love the Country Inn and Suites. Mish and house keeping are amazing. We asked for extra towels and the crib for my 1-year old and not only they came| but they set it up and added a hypoallergenic sheet. Only criticism was when we checked out my son needed his diaper changed and only the women‚Äôs restroom had the changing pad. The men‚Äôs restroom should have one to| but nonetheless this won‚Äôt deter us from staying there again.,Oct 28| 2018,4,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

The property was nice| clean and well kept.  The room was odd in that it had a sleeper sofa and desk in the front of the space| bathroom and king bed and huge empty space in the back of the room.  It was nice to have the sofa for our kids separated by the bathroom.  The room was laid out strangely.  We did have some issues with house keeping not cleaning the room but they fixed it and gave us some credit for the mistake.

Very nice new hotel in walking distance from Disneyland. Perfect for our family we were traveling with a 2month old. The only bad thing I can say is that our shower was hard to use.

My family has stayed in this hotel many times in the last few years since it opened.  Our experience is always positive with the staff.  The facility is very close to Disneyland which is very convenient.  Breakfast is average with little variety| it is satisfactory in filling the belly before a day at Disneyland.  Only negative comments I can say about the property is that the bathrooms were not quite as clean this trip as compared to previous stays and the beds are very hard.  The pool is amazing and it is a very quiet place to get your rest.  I really hope they address the uncomfortable beds before our next stay and other than that we cannot wait to return.,Sep 24| 2018,4,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
We loved our stay during our family trip to Disneyland. It was wonderful to come back after a exhausting day and relax at the bar while our kids swam in the pool. We ordered dinner from the bar a few of the nights and it was surprisingly delicious. It was so nice to not have to drove anywhere and fight any more crowds for dinner| we could eat and head straight up to bed. The breakfast was pretty good and they had plenty of space for all the kids and parents to get their food and not feel like we were climbing over each other. The beds were to hard for me and not very comfortable but that is my only complaint. We were able to relax on the beanbags and wait for our delayed plane in their cute little kids room located close to the bar. It really was a great hotel and a quick walk to Disneyland I would recommend it to any one looking for a close hotel to Disneyland.,Sep 24| 2018,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Overall| we really enjoyed this hotel! The people were friendly (even when we checked in late)| breakfast was included| and their little market was open when we got back late from the parks. The parking was a little limited| many people were using the parking lot for the hotel next door that is currently under construction. I can imagine parking will be more difficult when that is complete. Otherwise| great stay!,Sep 23| 2018,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
We were able to get an early check in and the process was quick. It was an easy walk to Disneyland and at the end of the day it was nice to discover that the pool stayed open late| allowed for a good wind down.,Sep 23| 2018,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

The pool is amazing and it is a very quiet place to get your rest.  I really hope they address the uncomfortable beds before our next stay and other than that we cannot wait to return.,Sep 24| 2018,4,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
We loved our stay during our family trip to Disneyland. It was wonderful to come back after a exhausting day and relax at the bar while our kids swam in the pool. We ordered dinner from the bar a few of the nights and it was surprisingly delicious. It was so nice to not have to drove anywhere and fight any more crowds for dinner| we could eat and head straight up to bed. The breakfast was pretty good and they had plenty of space for all the kids and parents to get their food and not feel like we were climbing over each other. The beds were to hard for me and not very comfortable but that is my only complaint. We were able to relax on the beanbags and wait for our delayed plane in their cute little kids room located close to the bar. It really was a great hotel and a quick walk to Disneyland I would recommend it to any one looking for a close hotel to Disneyland.,Sep 24| 2018,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Overall| we really enjoyed this hotel! The people were friendly (even when we checked in late)| breakfast was included| and their little market was open when we got back late from the parks. The parking was a little limited| many people were using the parking lot for the hotel next door that is currently under construction. I can imagine parking will be more difficult when that is complete. Otherwise| great stay!,Sep 23| 2018,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
We were able to get an early check in and the process was quick. It was an easy walk to Disneyland and at the end of the day it was nice to discover that the pool stayed open late| allowed for a good wind down.,Sep 23| 2018,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Very nice hotel for the price.  Friendly people and a good breakfast.,Sep 23| 2018,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Great stay| I highly recommend this hotel to any family that will be visiting Disneyland. Clean| great service and great breakfast.,Sep 21| 2018,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
I‚Äôll start by saying I love country inn and will continue to stay (this location included) but there were a few issues with our room. When we first got there| our lock didn‚Äôt work| which is just personal preference. The chair had a couple stains on it| and the bed was rock hard. You could hear the busy highway outside crystal clear (as well as the construction. The pros| this place is very clean| has free breakfast| and is walking distance to Disneyland. The staff is also very friendly and try to help any way possible. I would stay here again| although it will not be my first choice,Sep 20| 2018,4,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

This hotel is a gem. Clean| fresh rooms. Great breakfast. Swimming pool and spa open until midnight. We parked our car each day with ease. Sure there is a whirl of traffic in the am but it didn‚Äôt bother us. We have always stayed across the street from dl in those busy| tired hotels. Never again.,Sep 20| 2018,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Really close to Disney. Really helpful and kind staff (receptionist| waiters|cooks| cleaning crews). Stayed for five days and each day there was a slight variety in breakfast. Have stayed at many hotels in Anaheim before and I can say I will definitely book this hotel again for my next Disney trip.,Sep 19| 2018,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Hotel staff was helpful. Room was right next to cleaning staff storage area. There was loud banging in the morning around 630am. Cleaning staff on weekdays were very good| weekend staff did not do well and missed a lot of cleaning. Overall pleasing| but would make sure I was not next to hotel cleaning staff storage on each level. Don't expect a great cleaning on the weekends.,Sep 19| 2018,4,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
Lovely hotel| great location. Being fast walkers it only took us about 10 minutes to walk to Disneyland sometimes beating the ART shuttle that stops right outside! Plenty of restaurants within walking distance as well. Staff were pleasant & helpful when required. Over a 10 night stay the breakfast became repetitive I did however appreciate the fruit options for something healthy and the waffles were good. Coffee & cookies are available in the evenings which is a nice homely touch| very nice after a long day out. The room itself was large and spacious. Staying on the 5th floor we were lucky enough to view the Disney fireworks at night from our room. The minimart downstairs was actually quite well stocked & reasonably priced. Some small issues - on quite a few mornings we ran out of knives at breakfast. The in room coffee is atrocious| a kettle & actual cups & a spoon would be much better than the paper cups & weird little coffee machine. The towels are small & the provided soaps & wash were unpleasant| take your own! We generally take slippers when staying in hotels so didn't notice until the last day the carpets were quite sticky which was weird & gross. Be aware there is a resort fee that runs about $20 a day which adds up over a long stay. Overall the hotel was very good| with a few minor tweaks I think it could be great as most hotels in the area are quite old. Also there was works right next door but we had no noise issues.,Sep 19| 2018,4,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

This is a great little hotel. It‚Äôs newer compared to other hotels close to Disney. It‚Äôs about a 10 minute walk. It has free parking and free breakfast. A win/ win. It was clean and comfortable for me and my three preteen / teens. They swam in the pool / hot tub when we got back from Disney and I had a drink a drink at the bar. Perfect respite after a long day walking the park.,Sep 16| 2018,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

Lots of potential but lacking attention to detail. The room was a great size for our family but furniture was minimal and no frills like luggage racks. Bathroom has a sliding door but no lock. Pool and hot tub area was fantastic but pool towels were tiny and threadbare. Best breakfast I‚Äôve had in a budget hotel - clean and well designed flow so you are not waiting in line all morning. Carpets are in desperate need of a deep clean and when we asked for extra linens for the rollaway the blankets had stains on them. The service guy was kind.

Great location! Close enough to Disney| yet far enough to aboid all the disney traffic. The hotel was easy to find and very pleasing to the eye. Only down side is the construction site next door| however there was no construction being done at night. The staff was very friendly and answered all my questions (: the room itself was much bigger than expected and very clean! I would absolutely recommend this hotel for couples| families| etc! Very modern and newly decorated. Loved it!,Aug 23| 2018,4,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

As I commented in an earlier review of our stay this past weekend the staff at check In was ‚Äúokay‚Äù meaning it was perfunctory and for me not friendly but business like. I don‚Äôt expect more than a friendly| welcoming check in. We were the only people checking in so they were not busy with other people. Also I was not aware of the $100 charge added to the rate for incidentals and the $19 resort fee we would not be using. The staff called me that night after seeing my rating and took off the $19 fee as a gesture of goodwill which was nice. But then most of the chargers did not work in the room so when we got up only one phone was charged. We had to share one that worked the am before we left. I told staff at check out and he said he would have maintenance check the room before considering my request for a slightly reduced rate for our inconvenience. He didn‚Äôt call me back about it. On the way to the university to attend family orientation for our son I realized my phone charger was missing. I called the hotel and the staff personally went to see if it was in the one place where a charger worked. He said it wasn‚Äôt there. I later had time to go through my bag and there was no phone charger. Perhaps the cleaning staff took it. I don‚Äôt know. My husband and I shared his charger for the 10 hour family orientation at the university. I can afford a new charger but It was an inconvenience for sure.,Aug 23| 2018,2,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802

This hotel had everything you‚Äôd need during your stay and more! Even if you forgot something they had a small store that had tons of stuff at great prices! Tip: buy a poncho at the hotel for $3 instead of at Disney for $9 if you need one! Also the staff was so friendly. There‚Äôs a little hang out room for kids to watch movies| get popcorn and chill on comfy pillow chairs. There‚Äôs also some good Quiet spots for couples to lounge at which is what my husband and I did| we got drinks at the bar and sat in front of the fire place. It‚Äôs about a 12-15 minute walk to Disney but you can take the bus too bc there‚Äôs a stop at the hotel. But get your day pass at the front desk first| bc they don‚Äôt sell day passes on the bus. Also I ended up needing to do laundry and it‚Äôs free to use| they sell laundry detergents at the little store too which was only $1.00! Parking was simple bc they have outdoor as well as garage parking available| we chose to park in the garage to keep our care out of the sun. It was just PERFECT! Rooms are spacious too and you can see the fireworks from the pool area or your room if you‚Äôre lucky.,Aug 22| 2018,5,SunCoast Park Hotel Anaheim| Tapestry Collection by Hilton,1640 S Clementine St| Anaheim| CA| 92802
