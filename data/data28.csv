We had a great location in DT Chicago.  The hotel was clean and so where the rooms.  The breakfast was okay…waffles| sausage| potatoes| variety of breads| fruit| coffee and juices.  It felt safe because we were 3 women there for The Banksy Exhibit.,Aug 18| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E. Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
Friendly staff (Miles) that offered suggestions for places to go.,Aug 17| 2021,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E. Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
A great place to stay! It's quiet| clean| everyone was friendly. Very close to the river walk and L trains. Would stay here again!,Aug 17| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E. Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
Good service,Aug 17| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E. Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
We liked the location of this property—it was right by the river so we could walk almost everywhere we wanted to go. We didn’t like that our air conditioner in the room made a high whining/buzzing sound that we noticed as soon as we walked in—it sounded an airplane turbine. The hotel staff member said they couldn’t do anything about it and that they were all booked up so we would just have to deal with it. They refunded some of the money for our stay| but the situation wasn’t ideal. Luckily I had some earplugs—we each used one to help us sleep.,Aug 16| 2021,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E. Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
When we checked in the room was disgusting. We mentioned something to the front desk| but they had no other similar rooms available to move us to. They had the room cleaned the next morning| and it was still dirty. We ended our stay a day early because elf the room being gross. When I called the front desk| I spoke to the manager| who was rude about our complaints. They did comp one night| but only after I had to ask for it.,Aug 16| 2021,1,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E. Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601

I love the Art Deco features and the level of privacy. Staff is always accommodating and pleasant; we had a few issues and each was fixed immediately. The bed was not very comfortable| however| and the thermostat was set at 68 degrees| but the room got very warm overnight. I would definitely stay again at this Hampton Inn!,Aug 10| 2021,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E. Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601

Great location near tourist spots| one block to river walk.  Hotel has historic interest.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  Rooms are extremely small. The property has been remodeled but the upgrades were low quality.  Our wallpaper was buckling and dirty in places.  Very loud traffic noise.

Room was too small and hardly any space to move around even though we had a King bed. No valet or on-site parking but the hotel has off-site parking at a public parking which was a block away and there is a discount for hotel customers. Parking costs $43/night with ticket validation. Location was fantastic right in the heart of the city walkable distance to many restaurants| bars| shopping| river| etc.,Jul 27| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E.

I had 2 issues during our stay.  First| when we went to park we were instructed we could use the hotel app but were having connectivity issues.  The front desk attendant told us we did not need the app| to just get the ticket at the garage and that it was the same both ways.  When I retrieved my car the price was $10 more per day than the hotel rate. When I spoke to the front desk| I was told the rate using the app was $43| using the ticket was $53.  This cost me an extra $20.  The front desk employee did not seem to care that I was told the rate was the same using either method and that it costs me $20 extra for my stay.  Very frustrating.  Our second issue was with housekeeping.  We were told there would be housekeeping services.  When the room has not been serviced I requested additional towels/washclothes from the front desk.  Four hours later we returned to the room and still no towels.  We had to return yet again to request service.  This was rather ridiculous.  We finally received these late that evening.,Jul 26| 2021,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E. Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601

Room was great| bed was comfy...and they have even started breakfast again. Off site parking was just a block away so not a long walk.

The Hampton Inn Downtown was a great hotel in the perfect location.  As the former Motor Club of Chicago| the building provides a beautiful art-deco lobby from the 1920's.

The continental breakfast the same every morning - a prepackaged bagel| yogurt| hardboiled eggs.  I wish they would provide more variety.

Upon checking in I was told I was in the wrong hotel. Front desk attendant told me to go next door. After returning to the hotel again and she checked us in. She gave us our room keys which did not operate because apparently the room was already occupied. She did offer an upgraded room which apparently our party of 4 cannot use given we needed double beds. She then offered a $50 refund for the inconvenience. As we got to our room we did not have any complimentary bottles of water. We tried to call front desk and it kept ringing for about 5 mins straight? Still no pickup. Ended up going down to front desk. When asking for it at the front desk a different lady told us we should have received it upon check in and we can only have 2 and she told us they were low with an unpleasant tone.,Jun 24| 2021,1,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E.

I loved the location. It was near everything we wanted to do. It was great to stay somewhere with history behind it such as the motor company. The only bad thing was that their was construction nearby. But I know Hilton has no control over that. Due to COVID breakfast wasn’t served and no indoor pool. We’re the only downsides. Other that that rooms and building were great.,May 28| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E. Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
The price wasn't too bad for the area.,May 26| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E. Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
Oh Gosh it wasn’t the best hotel we booked in cause didn’t have their own parking area | also we kept hearing the toilet plushing from upstairs like every 5 mins its annoying. Breakfast was crappy too.,May 25| 2021,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E. Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
Staff was amazing & very helpful. Location is amazing. Central to all the big attractions. Hotel & rooms were beautiful. Doubles are cozy| but definitely comfortable. Parking is a short hike| but there’s an unloading zone in front of the hotel for checking in. Not doing a hot breakfast due to covid. Bar is also closed due to covid| which was a letdown.  The only complaint is there is construction right next to the building| & the curtains in the room don’t close| so our room was illuminated at night from the lights. Otherwise| I’d definitely stay again,May 25| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E. Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601

Location was perfect. The nice woman that checked us in was so kind and went above what I expected.  The hotel was advertising for drinks they did not have at the bar such as their draft beers| but we found other places with such great views.

The Staff were extremely nice and helpful. The cover on my daughters bed was stained. When we pulled off the sheets| there were crumbs of some nature on the mattress pad| which looked like it had not been changed in a long time. We found a smoking device on the floor. BEWARE the city is under construction. This hotel is right next to a major overhaul starting before day break. They are right outside your window and can see inside your room easily. The hotel parking is a block away. You have to cross over a major roadway to get to your parking. It looks scary at first but seriously| you will be fine.,Apr 22| 2021,2,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E. Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601

I came into town with my husband for a quick business trip and were very happy with our stay. The front desk associates were so helpful with finding restaurants after we checked in and gave great directions to the parking (one block away).

Breakfast we pretty limited due to COVID| but appreciated the effort. I have a gluten and dairy intolerance| so I wasn't able to eat it (which is normal| unfortunately). But I came prepared with my own bagels in the hopes that I'd have access to a toaster. The front desk attendant searched all over for a toaster| but couldn't track one down.

Great location! We had about 5 days in Chicago and only used public transportation once (to visit the Field Museum - too lazy to walk there :) but it's trully possible if you'd like - 25 mins away) - everything else we wanted to visit was 15-20 minutes walk - Sky Deck| Navy Pier| Millennium Park (Cloud Gate aka Bob)| Chicago River and so on. Room was comfortable| lobby - very beautiful.

I anticipated two days of reservation and left because of the lack of structure for the Coronavirus fetus.  I would like to be reimbursed for these two unused nights| indivisible as for Indianapolis (it would be next but I also had to cancel).,Mar 21| 2020,2,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E.

The noise level at this hotel is beyond loud!!!! It is right next to a very busy fire station and also a bunch of night clubs.

There was a desk clerk named Drew and from the time we arrived he made my wife and I stay enjoyable. Our plane arrived early and naturally we wanted to get to the hotel as quick as possible to drop our luggage off and grab a bite. Knowing we were super early to the hotel we knew that check in would be slim. Upon arrival Drew greeted my wife and I asked about our flight and we explained everything went well and arrived early to drop everything off to grab a bite and explore the city. Drew said our room was ready for check in and invited us to have breakfast in the lobby. He gave recommendations to local restaurants and site tours (skydeck) which was really helpful and appreciated. Along with the other staff at night and the following days the entire stay was enjoyable and definitely recommend staying at this hotel again.,Jan 6| 2020,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E.

The location of the property was good. It was accessible to many of the popular sites and public transportation. We were surprised  to find that there weren’t any dresser drawers in the room. We thought that is a standard so we had to leave out of our suitcase during our stay. You can hear street noise from our room. There are also construction right next to the hotel which of course the hotel has no control over. The staff was very courteous. The hotel kept our luggage after we checked out since our flight was later and we wanted to explore more.,Nov 27| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E.

The location of the property was good. It was accessible to many of the popular sites and public transportation. We were surprised  to find that there weren’t any dresser drawers in the room. We thought that is a standard so we had to leave out of our suitcase during our stay. You can hear street noise from our room. There are also construction right next to the hotel which of course the hotel has no control over. The staff was very courteous. The hotel kept our luggage after we checked out since our flight was later and we wanted to explore more.,Nov 27| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E.

The atmosphere of the hotel in the morning would be markedly improved if the TV news was shut off| or put a small screen in a corner.  With the news blaring thru the 2-story lobby with hard acoustics is not a nice place for breakfast.  It's an art deco building| why not play 20s/30s soft swing to complete the setting.  But especially at 6am| and I was the only one| besides the desk clerk| it is a grim sounding space with the TV news in the background.

The location is excellent and the decor is terrific.  The staff was courteous and nice.  What was not good was the noise from a block away that could be heard clear as day through the windows.  It was almost as if the sirens| cars and trucks were driving through our room.  It was terrible.,Aug 22| 2019,3,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E.

Spent one night here to catch the train from Millenium Station in the morning. The hotel was in a great location. The highlight of our stay was the comfy bed and the continental breakfast.

I rarely leave negative reviews of hotels. When I book| I’m very budget conscious and therefore gauge my expectations appropriately. But being a Hilton Honors member| I’ve stayed in my far share of Hamptons and this one fell below par. First the positives: -The location is good. Not amazing but within about a mile of most major attractions. Coming from O’Hare| we took the blue line L train and got off at Clark/Lake and it was maybe a half mile walk to the hotel. -All staff members we dealt with were very friendly. -Room was clean. No complaints there. Now what fell short for me:-Noise during the night. There aren’t words to describe the ungodly noises from outside at 4 am to 7 am every night but one that we were there. Sounded like someone dropping a metal dumpster from a third story balcony repeatedly. We aren’t light sleepers and were both miserable. -View. We had a view of a dirty alley. I always expect a crappy view when I book through a travel site if I don’t upgrade to a special room but this was definitely disappointing. -Size. Again| travel site bookings are the bottom of the barrel for hotels and the Hampton stuffed us into a room that was smaller than any European room I’ve stayed in. -False advertising. The online photo showed a shower door. Our room had a curtain. Not a big deal to some but I avoid germ-lined curtains intentionally.I hate to say I wouldn’t recommend to anyone. Kind of the downer of our otherwise great trip.,Aug 13| 2019,2,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E. Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
We had a really nice stay! The breakfast was great and changed on a daily basis so they never served the same hot food. We were there for 5 days. The location was great. The only complaint I would have is that we stayed on the 14th floor| which I was absolutely fine with| but this meant they did not come to clean the room until the end of the day which was annoying. We would leave by say 9am and come back at 4-6pm and the room would still not be cleaned! Also| in the room| there was a huge pillar that took up a significant amount of the room which was irritating as well. If you do stay here and stay on one of the higher floors| call the desk when you leave for the day so they don't come around 7:45 pm to clean your room and then do a crap job because they are upset even though it was them who completely forgot (and then they accused me of leaving the sign on the door - which I did not do!).,Aug 12| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E.

This hotel has the perfect location if you want to be in the middle of the action in Chicago...only few blocks away of Millennium Park| bus stops| and the train. We stayed there for 6 nights and we were really pleased. I would’ve given a better review if it’s not because the breakfast is not great| we had breakfast included but we ended up eating out 3 days. If you don’t mind to have a very simple breakfast you will be fine. I read all the reviews before booking and some people complained  about the noise| so I requested a room in the higher floors| we were on the 7th floor and I could still hear the street noise (like garbage trucks or something). After the first night it didn’t bother me that much| just be mindful of the perks to be in the middle of Chicago.,Jun 21| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E.

Everything about this hotel is great| expect| the size of the room.  We were a little disappointed with the room size| but it worked out.

We were traveling with a tired toddler waiting to be checked in.. We requested if early check in is possible| they said they will try. Since 4pm we kept going to the reception asking if room was ready and they said the cleaning dept hadn't reported it yet. It was almost at 4:45 that we go checked in. And even at that time I went with a sleeping toddler on my shoulder asking about it. They didn't even us call us when the room was ready. Coming to the room| it was non smoking but we clearly could smell smoke from the room door. Very disappointed| especially staying with a toddler.,Jun 20| 2019,1,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E. Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601

Nice hotel in a great location near the river. Reasonable walk to many sites on Michigan Ave. and the surrounding area. Came during college spring break with my daughter|  but will definitely return during warmer weather. Would also choose this hotel again. The staff was friendly and accommodating (held our bags before and after check-in)| the breakfast options were tasty and fresh and hotel was clean.,Mar 13| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E.

I lived that it had this boutique hotel feel. The staff was extremely helpful and courteous. The rooms were small| but very chic and clean. The only negative was that you could hear the traffic really loudly outside| even in the 14tf floor.,Feb 25| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E. Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
I was told that the credit card I used to reserve the room was not valid and my room was given to someone else| I was told that they called me but didn't leave a message...I got a room next door from Hampton inn and paid for it with the same credit card no problem... How do you explain that? I think they over book the rooms and then use this excuse to manage their mess ups... Not coming back..,Feb 24| 2019,1,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E.

Lovely historic building updated with modern comforts. The free breakfast was nice to have| and the hotel was walking distance to most places we wanted to go and just a couple blocks from the trains. I used the fitness center| which was okay. The machines aren't very sturdy| but at least there is a place to work out. Rooms are small but the layout is very functional and makes it feel larger than it looks. The front desk and valet staff were friendly and always helpful. They will hold your luggage behind the desk| which was helpful on our last day since we had a late departure. I would stay here again.,Feb 13| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E. Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601

It seemed more like it was a business type hotel.  It was clean| reasonably comfortable| and the breakfast was pretty good (good sausage patties the first day| but blah eggs in an omlet| and the second day the scrambled eggs were good| but horrid turkey sausage links).  The location is great (in fact| probably the best thing about it) for the River-walk and Millennium park| pretty close to the L and some other downtown landmarks.  I wasn't a fan of the room layout (with the TV way over on the side| as more of an afterthought).  I also didn't like that we had a separate door to go through to get to our room door (only a few rooms seemed to have this| but mine did| and I didn't really like it).  Overall| I'd give it a 4/5.  I'd be willing to stay here again (although I'd want a different room).,Jan 26| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E. Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601

We were stuck in Chicago when our flight was cancelled so wanted something reasonably priced and close to orange line which goes to Midway. Breakfast was great! It was comfy. Room smelled damp and we could not figure out AC/heating. You are paying for the extremely central location. Our first night was 237US and second 350US. 350 was too much but could not be bothered moving. Staff was great.,Oct 10| 2018,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E.

With a location down the street from the fire station| we were treated to sirens all night long. The room had only a desk chair so one of us always had to sit on the bed. Finally| we had a prepaid room but they still held $969 dollars on my credit card. It took multiple conversations with the front desk before the manager resolved the issue.

Nice hotel in downtown Chicago| walking distance to a lot of tourist attractions. Room was nice but rather small. There's not enough drawer space for clothes.,Oct 14| 2018,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E. Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
The carpet smelled like stinky feet. The bed mattress we could feel the springs. The breakfast was ok. A little slow to add more food for the guests.,Oct 13| 2018,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E. Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
We were stuck in Chicago when our flight was cancelled so wanted something reasonably priced and close to orange line which goes to Midway. Breakfast was great! It was comfy. Room smelled damp and we could not figure out AC/heating. You are paying for the extremely central location. Our first night was 237US and second 350US. 350 was too much but could not be bothered moving. Staff was great.,Oct 10| 2018,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E. Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
My only concern was the room temperature. Several adjustments were made but the room was still too cold. Had to sleep with extra clothing and comforters.,Oct 9| 2018,5,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E. Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601

With a location down the street from the fire station| we were treated to sirens all night long. The room had only a desk chair so one of us always had to sit on the bed.

Rummen var rena och fina med sköna sängar och kylskåp| utan att vara något extra men perfekta för att vara där en weekend då man knappt hinner vara på rummet. Frukosten var klart över medel jämfört med andra amerikanska gratis hotellfrukostar.

家族旅行(大人2人、中学生、小学生の4人)で利用。ウィリスタワーやミレニアムパーク、シカゴ美術館等、ダウンタウンの観光地へのアクセスがとてもよかった。ホテルの部屋はとても清潔で気持ちよかった。装備品は必要最低限。アメニティはシャンプーやせっけんはあるが・・・という感じ。部屋の広さはダブルベッド2台の部屋だったが、広いという感じはない。まあ観光から帰ってきて寝るだけの場所と考えれば、気にならないかと。空調は効きすぎなので、一枚羽織るものを用意したほうが良いと思う。,Aug 8| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,68 E.
