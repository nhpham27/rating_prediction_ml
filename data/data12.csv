Doubletree bumped us to Hotel Central New York South and it was the worst experience ever| no house keeping| I had to call the lobby and ask to have someone come get the trash and I had to call to ask for toilet paper and fresh towels. The shower door didn’t close correctly the sink faucet spritzed everywhere| there was no complimentary bottle water the ice machine didn’t work| and the area was not very nice at all| I would not recommend this place even to my worse enemy,May 22| 2021,1,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
I really enjoyed my stay. Will recommend to others. Customer service very friendly.,Mar 29| 2021,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
Could not use our reservation due COVID and could not cancel AND lost our Reward Night. Very disappointing.,Dec 22| 2020,2,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
I made a reservation at the Double Tree. When I showed up| I was informed that it was turned into a shelter due to covid.  No one informed me of this in advance. My reservation was moved to another hotel with no heads up at all.,Dec 7| 2020,1,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

Clean property| needs snack vending machines and food service,May 4| 2020,5,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
Good hotel overall. Service staff were super helpful and polite. Linens were clean. The only issue I had with the room was the bad mildewy or moldy smell from heating/cooling unit whenever the fan was on| and the strong mold smell in bathroom so I left the fan on all day. Down pillows also had strong smell. Not for the allergic.,Mar 29| 2020,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

Wonderful stay. Breakfast is okay but all stead were nice.,Mar 14| 2020,5,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
Terrible smoke smell. No shampoo or soap. No toilet power holder. Had 2 rooms and both had extremely inconsistent maid service. Not up to Hilton standards really disappointed.,Mar 13| 2020,1,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
The bathroom pipes were clogged all the time! It was uncomfortable when it comes to share your stay with some friends.,Mar 10| 2020,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

It had a nice restaurant but was cramped in size and nothing really special. Rooms are very small and bathrooms are inadequate. The closet was not a closet and clothes could not be hung.,Mar 3| 2020,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
Easy check in| check out.  Friendly| helpful staff. Room on the small side for a 6 night break. No room for suitcases. Good area with easy transport links to enjoy Manhattan.,Mar 3| 2020,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

The hotel is run down and the elevators break down.  Although the staff was nice| not very knowledgeable.  I needed a safety pin and asked for a sewing kit.  The staff advised it did not come with one and I should go to Duane Reade.  I asked for one anyway and found one in the sewing kit.,Feb 17| 2020,1,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
The location is amazing for a first time stay in New York. It’s close to every cool tourist spot but there are also 100’s of other hotels around the same area. The elevators are super tiny here| but I imagine most of NY to have tiny rooms and facilities. The rooms definitely need to be refurbished as some of the stuff were damaged and unsightly| but the bed was comfy. Overall| it was an OK stay.,Feb 17| 2020,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
Clean and comfy and a great rate. We have been coming for decades. Seems as they are cutting corners little by little| our room was looking slightly ragged.,Feb 12| 2020,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

A reasonably priced room in NY.  Main complaint was that the elevators were slow.  Too many floors for only two cars.  Room was ready for early check-in| so that was a plus.  Room itself - I got a low floor| right next to the elevator| probably because I booked on Expedia - was predictably small.  Closet/armoire had a full size ironing board wedged into it.  Not a lot of room for much else.  Did not locate the ice bucket until checkout.  Bathroom also small| but that's to be expected.  No alarm clock| but there's an app for that.  If all you need's a bed for the night| and you're not looking for an experience| this place is fine.,Jan 20| 2020,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

Had made reseveration thru Hotels.comType of room was not available. Had been put in a double bed room for 4 nights. Spent over 2 hours on the phone with hotels.com just got so frustrated. So much for sliver service from Hotels.com. It was a joke...,Jan 16| 2020,2,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
Very nice hotel. Clean| good sized room! (especially for a hotel in Manhattan!) When I was checking in| the front desk person was very nice and helpful. They also offered late checkout. The breakfast was delicious. I didn't realize the breakfast buffet closed at 10am| I got there at like 10:45. I was kind of disappointed by that| but the food you could order on the menu was great. Also the cookies they give you at the front desk is very good. Only thing that bothered me is during the night the hallway smelled like a strong smell of cigarette smoke. But I think that was another guest smoking. The hotel has signs in the rooms that say smoking is not allowed. It's in a great location. Right near Herald Square Macy's and all the subways/PATH trains. Very short walk to Times Square and all the main attractions. Also Chelsea is a very nice neighborhood in general| so the hotel is along a nice street. I will definitely be staying here again next time I need a hotel in NYC!,Jan 16| 2020,5,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

Great location staying at this hotel| close to the subway and easy to get an Uber/taxi. Approx 15 minute walk from empire state building and only 10 minutes from madison square garden. Great restaurants located nearby and very convenient location. Staff are excellent and helpful! You can request mineral water for free at the check in desk each day. The rooms are ok| very outdated and the cleanliness was ok - found dust around the room on our first day when we checked in. The lifts are appalling| there are about 27 floors in this hotel and only 2 lifts that skip the bottom floors. We were on the 4th floor and just took the stairs down each time as we gave up waiting for the lift. Apart from that| all was ok! Decent for the price paid and location.,Jan 4| 2020,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

Great location and the staff we interacted with were extremely helpful and friendly. Overall a fairly nice place| however the carpet in the common hallway on our floor (5th) was filthy. Looked like it hadn't been vacuumed or cleaned in some time. Our room's carpet was fine| albeit a little dated. So overall not that big of a deal| but it was hard not to notice as it's the first thing you see when you step off the elevator.,Dec 30| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

Location is great.   5 minutes walk from Penn Station.   The hotel is very small and old but the room and amenities were very nice.  Great shower|The best thing was the price!!!!    I can give up fancy lobby and oversized rooms to save substantial amount of money,Dec 10| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
The hotel is older| but clean  and the beds were really nice. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The only negative was the lobby. It is quite small with very little seating. Overall I definitely would stay here again.,Dec 21| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

I felt that the rooms need to be updated. The carpet was stained and the chair needed to replaced.,Dec 18| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
The staff was so lovely... very friendly and helpful... room service which is sometimes delivered as an afterthought... was excellent!Thank you.  I would recommend this hotel...

We picked this hotel because it is very convenient to penn station| but we weren’t very happy with it. The front sitting area and entrance had construction barriers and bags of garbage piled up. There is almost no lobby at all so no place to sit or even stand when you are waiting to meet people. The whole place was a little dingy and sad. We will definitely try a different place next time,Dec 1| 2019,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

The 2 bed room was small but good for a weekend.,Nov 29| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
The staff was very courteous and friendly.  Upon arrival| was greeted with warm chocolate peanut butter cookies.  Very small room and cozy bed.  The carpet is very dated but overall| I enjoyed my stay.  The upper floor rooms is were the view of the Empire State Building.  The location was great.  The hotel is close to the police dept| Metro train| Empire State Buliding| Madison Square Garden| The Wendy Williams and Rachel Ray Show.  Plenty of restaurants and galleries.  Only problem was self parking| which is on the other side of the hotel.  Two night stay... Arrived late| around 8 pm.  Parking was discounted at $33 per 24 hrs stay.   I was charged full price on the last day| after leaving early.  Plus if you leave out of the parking garage| the Parking garage will recharge you an additional $33 to park.    Other than that| I will stay at this hotel agsin.,Nov 27| 2019,5,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

Overall| the hotel didn't seem to reflect the quality that I've experienced in the past with Doubletree.  With the Doubletree brand| I expect higher quality versus other hotels.  At this location| the service was strong and professional.  The lobby was very dated and small| with no real sense of presence.

Service was terrible.  Upon arrival the front desk clerk did paperwork and ignored me for at least 10 minutes before checking me in.  Coffee in the morning is complimentary and when leaving the front desk charged me extra for coffee.  Don’t mind paying for coffee but not when it’s supposed to be complimentary.  The front desk and manager argued with me when I brought it to their attention and actually accused me of eating breakfast there| which never happened.

I’ve stayed in cleaner & newer Doubletrees. But this one is convenient. It’s a 5 min walk to the MTA stations or 7 min walk to Penn Station. You can take the MTA to JFK for $2.75. It’s definitely better to stay in this area than in Times Square. You can get to Time Square via MTA in 10 min. Chinatown and its great food in Canal Street is reachable via MTA in 25 min.  From Penn Station| you can take the NJ Line to EWR Airport for $15| or the Long Island RR to Long Island. 2.75. It’s a 7 min walk to a Nordstrom Rack and a 3-5 min walk to reasonably priced eateries & pizza parlors.,Jun 18| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

I attempted to cancel this reservation prior to staying but I was within the cancellation period.  I am truly disappointed at the conditions of this hotel.  The Hilton Chelsea did not meet its expectations.  The check in was good but the rooms are old| smell| and small.  Our first room had dirty linens and smelled so they switched our room...

This property is very old. The room condition was quite poorly maintained. Ripped wall paper| stained carpets| the hallways are really worn and dirty| the public bathrooms are disgusting and the smell is horrible| there are only two elevators and you may have to wait 15 minutes for an elevator| the rooms are so tiny you have no where to open luggage (they are all the same as we asked to upgrade and there are only a few studios)| the condition of the ac/heating unit is awful (broken units)| the iron was so damaged that it destroyed my shirt and the bathrooms are so tiny and the door takes up so much space (why isn’t there a sliding door?). Overall there’s not much to like. This hotel needs a major overhaul. Even the lobby is unkept| unwelcoming| and unsightly. For a Hilton property this was really poorly maintained.,Apr 8| 2019,2,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
Great rooms for the price although they are tiny. Very clean. Bar/restaurant is small| we had to find somewhere to eat to fit our party of 7. Staff was excellent.,Apr 16| 2019,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

I attempted to cancel this reservation prior to staying but I was within the cancellation period.  I am truly disappointed at the conditions of this hotel.  The Hilton Chelsea did not meet its expectations.  The check in was good but the rooms are old| smell| and small.  Our first room had dirty linens and smelled so they switched our room... The second room wasn’t as big| but was cleaner.

The room was wonderful. But I feel like they need to have more elevators for a hotel of his size: the lobby is always filled with a crowd waiting for the elevator.,Jan 7| 2019,5,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

Hotel was far from the pics but it is all good. Contstruction were ongoing. We were “double check-in”| meaning given a room that was already occupied since when we entered| I noticed the luggage from the guest before me in line.

Hotel is a little old/dated. Bit stuffy. Hotel bar/rest is not flash. Bed was very comfortable and large for a New York hotel room. Lots of draws and storage for cases and clothes which really helps. Higher floors are better for use of lifts as in the morning theres never room for lower floor guests to get in. First world issues....location is ok but in a bit of a tired/funny spot not really in Chelsea. Street is not appealing.

Last minute trip to NYC so I picked this location because it was close to the venue my son needed to be at for a show. The hotel was under construction so the lobby was a mess. In fact it felt like there was a hole in the floor at the main entrance and there was just a rug thrown on top of it. The room itself was nice but I noticed little things in the middle of the night that irritated me. The shower head was dripping water and the smoke detector started chirping in the middle of the night like the batteries needed to be changed. The room was a bit outdated and the bed linen and towels were thin and rough. I only stayed one night.,Sep 16| 2018,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

The room that I booked was not ready so they decided to upgrade us to a suite for the night. The suite was only prepared for 2 people when there was four of us and the bed sheets were urine stained and no cover on the duvet. On the second day| we were asked to change rooms again but again they had no room ready for us and we were asked to leave everything in our room with our valuables out of the safe for the hotel staff to move. I explained that we had valuables and passports that needed to stay in the safe and that I will not leave them unattended; they said that we can leave them or come back at 12 when there is a room available and if I didn’t do either of the 2 choices I would be escorted from the premises. The manager on duty had a discusting attitude and did not want to help us one bit| even though it was the hotels fault that we had to move rooms,Sep 14| 2018,1,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

Our hotel room was tiny| dirty and had a terrible odour. The carpet in the rooms was dirty. It is under a huge renovation so the whole lobby is torn up. There were workmen everywhere. It was not good. The staff were very nice and doing their best under the circumstances. I felt like it was not good value for the money,Sep 8| 2018,2,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
Last minute trip to NYC so I picked this location because it was close to the venue my son needed to be at for a show. The hotel was under construction so the lobby was a mess. In fact it felt like there was a hole in the floor at the main entrance and there was just a rug thrown on top of it. The room itself was nice but I noticed little things in the middle of the night that irritated me. The shower head was dripping water and the smoke detector started chirping in the middle of the night like the batteries needed to be changed. The room was a bit outdated and the bed linen and towels were thin and rough. I only stayed one night.,Sep 16| 2018,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

The room that I booked was not ready so they decided to upgrade us to a suite for the night. The suite was only prepared for 2 people when there was four of us and the bed sheets were urine stained and no cover on the duvet. On the second day| we were asked to change rooms again but again they had no room ready for us and we were asked to leave everything in our room with our valuables out of the safe for the hotel staff to move.

There's some renovations going on that we didn't know about. There's only two small elevators so the wait times are significant. The room was clean but clearly very dated. Carpets could use a face lift.

Expedia| unfortunately| messed up our reservations. Their inventory did not match the hotel's room inventory so we did not get the two double bedrooms like we ordered. Thankfully| DoubleTree still was able to accommodate us and they placed us in one double bedroom and two king bedrooms at no extra cost. The staff overall was excellent and very nice! We didn't eat the breakfast but from what I could tell it was nice and it was always packed in the mornings.It was centrally located for the most part. Within walking distances to a lot of sights like the Empire State Building and stores (Macy's| Nordstrom Rack| H&M|etc.) which was a bonus. Just be aware the streets in Chelsea are not as clean as other areas in NYC so watch your step when walking. If it hasn't been raining and you see a puddle| don't step in it. It's not rain.   The hotel is under renovation at least in the lobby area from what I could see. The rooms definitely need some refurbishing but nonetheless| the beds were comfortable and clean and the showers were great. I probably wouldn't pick this hotel to stay for a long length of time or at least not until their renovations are done. But it was a good bang for your buck.,Jul 16| 2018,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

Currently under construction so there are only 2 elevators which at one point there was a line just to go up. Lobby was cut in half so it got crowded and crammed. It was also occasionally loud due to the machinery being used. Smaller than I expected but it is NYC so it makes sense. Great location and access to subways and tourist areas. Staff was friendly and helpful. Room had everything we needed and was a nice stay. It wasn’t anything fancy| but it wasn’t bad. If you need a place to rest your head| get in a million showers (with that summer humidty!)| great A/C| nice location| then this place should do it!,Jul 7| 2018,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

The service is very good and the people are friendly and helpful. Unfortunately this hotel is in need of a refresh| which I expect is going to happen given the scaffolding out front. The bathroom smelled like a gym locker| which we suspected was the shower curtain. The 90+ weather in NYC didn't help. Room was very small as was the bathroom and the sink and furnishings in the bathroom were worn. The towels were also thin and small. The fan in the bathroom was also very loud as was the air conditioner. The location is great| but the hotel needs an upgrade.,Jul 6| 2018,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

The staff was friendly and helpful|  The hotel is undergoing renovations and was very noisy and congested due to the lobby being closed off.,Jul 11| 2018,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
hotel location is great. But room was awful| too small| bad odor in the room and beds| no success to change the room. Asked to have mini refrigerator without success as well.,Jul 9| 2018,2,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
Currently under construction so there are only 2 elevators which at one point there was a line just to go up. Lobby was cut in half so it got crowded and crammed. It was also occasionally loud due to the machinery being used. Smaller than I expected but it is NYC so it makes sense. Great location and access to subways and tourist areas. Staff was friendly and helpful. Room had everything we needed and was a nice stay. It wasn’t anything fancy| but it wasn’t bad. If you need a place to rest your head| get in a million showers (with that summer humidty!)| great A/C| nice location| then this place should do it!,Jul 7| 2018,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

Front desk stuffs are very friendly but housekeeping is not up to the mark of Hilton.,Jul 6| 2018,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
The service is very good and the people are friendly and helpful. Unfortunately this hotel is in need of a refresh| which I expect is going to happen given the scaffolding out front. The bathroom smelled like a gym locker| which we suspected was the shower curtain. The 90+ weather in NYC didn't help. Room was very small as was the bathroom and the sink and furnishings in the bathroom were worn. The towels were also thin and small. The fan in the bathroom was also very loud as was the air conditioner. The location is great| but the hotel needs an upgrade.,Jul 6| 2018,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

If you want to stay at Double Tree stay at the one in time square it’s so much better for just a little more. This was small and cramped up. We had booked a king bed. But that most definitely wasn’t a king. I am currently on my own king bed with my baby and husband and it is so much more roomier than that one. I even asked the front staff to make sure. The location was OK. Close to Koreatown| penn station| some restaurants. The actual block was dirty and bummy. We walked over from 8th Avenue and kind of felt uncomfortable with the area. But towards 7th was much better.,Jun 18| 2018,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

The first room we stayed in smelled so bad and musty that it made my asthma worse and I coughed all night. We ended up moving to another room. It wasn’t musty in the 2nd room| but the bathroom tub and the sink in the bathroom had drain issues.

I liked this hotel overall| but I can’t rate it as highly. I love Doubletrees and the service and free cookies. However| the frustration we had is is due to the fact that they didn’t let us know about the construction going on upon arrival. We got a note under the door from management that we didn’t even see until the morning. They said they’d be doing construction on the walkway from 8am on. Well we really wanted to sleep in because we both work later in the day. This was very disruptive to our sleep and extremely loud as we were right above the street. This is unprofessional and ridiculous for such a highly rated hotel in NYC. I would have asked for a refund or discount but just wanted to leave. Also the comforter was falling apart and the room was a bit musty.

The hotel is off the beaten track tucked off the street on 29th. The room was small even by NYC standards| bathroom looked like it had not really been cleaned in number of stays| just a quick wipe. Shower was moldy| carpets needed work. Overall the condition of the room was poor. They definitely need to ramp up the inspection of the rooms. Also| someone needs to stay on top of the engineering department. Our room had a broken picture frame| a bathroom mirror that was delaminating| and some poorly repaired furniture.,Feb 20| 2018,2,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

Booked a last minute stay and was not disappointed. I was nervous because the price seemed too reasonable ($95) for a decent hotel in midtown...but i was wrong. It was clean (showed some signs of age)| comfortable (very comfy bed)| and centrally located  (near 28th st metro station and penn station.) Elevator went down one morning| but we were onlyon the 3rd floor| so it wasnt too inconvenient. I would definately stay there again.,Feb 12| 2018,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

Shower was moldy| carpets needed work. Overall the condition of the room was poor. They definitely need to ramp up the inspection of the rooms. Also| someone needs to stay on top of the engineering department. Our room had a broken picture frame| a bathroom mirror that was delaminating| and some poorly repaired furniture.,Feb 20| 2018,2,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

One of the elevators was frequently out of service ( the majority of our four day stay)| leaving only one to transport guests in their 27 floor hotel. This was rather frustrating. Great views | great staff...,Feb 12| 2018,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
Booked a last minute stay and was not disappointed. I was nervous because the price seemed too reasonable ($95) for a decent hotel in midtown...but i was wrong. It was clean (showed some signs of age)| comfortable (very comfy bed)| and centrally located  (near 28th st metro station and penn station.) Elevator went down one morning| but we were onlyon the 3rd floor| so it wasnt too inconvenient. I would definately stay there again.,Feb 12| 2018,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
This is a great hotel with a TERRIBLE elevator situation.  Get a room on a lower floor and take the stairs.,Feb 10| 2018,5,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
Easy access to subway.  Very walkable neighborhood.  Close to sightseeing and shopping.  Room was comfortable bathroom small and ceilings with cracked plaster.  Enjoyed the view of the empire state building from our room.  Found nightly rates to be quite reasonable.,Feb 8| 2018,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
The receptionist were very friendly and nice. Great location| would recommend to others.,Feb 6| 2018,5,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
very comfortable and close to stores| theaters| restaurant an Penn Station.,Feb 4| 2018,5,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
Couldn't check-in upon arrival at 2pm. The booking stated check-in starts at 4pm but the hotel did not accommodate us and gave us a low floor room stating that the hotel was overbooked (we had however booked several weeks ago).Bed and pillows excellent but the room was very small and dusty. Some channels on TV did not work and the satelite/internet connection was poor.The elevators were slow and insufficient for the demand.,Feb 1| 2018,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

The hotel is very comfortable and the location is very good to move around regardless of whether you choose to do that by feet or to take the subway (2 stations nearby). The staff is attentive and they store your luggage if you arrived earlier than expected. The room was super clean and cleaned again daily.,Dec 27| 2017,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
The hotel did not look like it did on the website. The room was small and looked like it had been a very long time since it was cleaned. The curtains were full of dust and we found a live roach in the drawer with the glasses and ice pitcher. The only thing positive that I can say is that the staff were all very friendly and apologetic.,Dec 26| 2017,2,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
Room was clean and quiet stayed two nights in a 10th floor single king at the back of the building so not facing the street.  Bit of an annoyance was the bathroom door that would never stay open.  This hotel is one of those small hotels squeezed into the streets around Chelsea.  Elevators weren't too bad| there are only 2 of them shared with housekeeping.  29th St around the hotel is not so nice until you get onto 7th Ave| homeless sleeping in doorways| folks smoking in parked cars| and trash everywhere.  I would only stay here for a cheap rate| at high rates there will be better value to be found elsewhere.,Dec 26| 2017,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

My husband| two daughters| and I stayed in a room with two full beds. The room was very small| which is to be expected in Manhattan. I guess what I didn’t expect was how small and cramped even the hallways were. We were on the 2nd floor| which is apparently were the hotel staff keeps all of the vacuums. Literally| just in the hallway outside of our room. I think the staff also had a closet on The seconds floor where they kept towels and other supplies. The staff was so loud anytime they were getting supplies. I’m actually not sure if they were exceptionally loud or if the hotel is just so tight and close together that you can hear everything that is going on. I’m a heavy sleeper and can usually sleep through a lot| but I was woken every morning by employees in the hallway. There are two elevators in the hotel. On the last day of our trip one of the elevators broke. We could have taken the stairs| but the entrance to the staircase that goes up to all the floors was only accessible through a locked door on the outside of the building. Only the hotel staff had the key to get in through that door. Sometimes we would use those stairs to go down from our room. The staff would pile trash that needed to be taken out on the landing of the stairs so we would have to squeeze through to trash to get downstairs. Good parts of the hotel: comfy beds| relatively clean rooms| happy staff. I think the problems with this hotel all come from a lack of space.,Dec 22| 2017,2,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
Good stay; decent price for the accommodations provided . One of two elevators not working taking the stairs was not convenient. Location excellent.

This hotel is very central in Manhattan.. we love to walk| but had subways convenient to us if needed (Penn Station| 28th St) The rooms are ok in size for New York. Staff are friendly & helpful.

Nice hotel 2 minutes walk from Madison Square Gardens and 5 minutes walk from the Empire State Building.  The first impression wasn't great as we arrived at night down what appeared to be a dark alley into a small reception area.  The room was small but immaculately clean with a really comfortable bed which I was loathe to leave.  There is a small bar which was nice after a whole day walking around.  There is also a restaurant which I haven't tried yet but will have breakfast there today.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel.,Dec 4| 2017,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

There is a bus stop and a subway station soon.Pennsylvania station is nearby| and access by Kennedy Airport and New Work Airport is also very good by train.,Sep 13| 2018,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
Hotellet var eldre enn det ser ut som på bildene. Dette var i utgangspunktet ikke noe problem| men kombinert med at fellesområdet var rene byggeplassen| ble ikke inntrykket så veldig positivt. Vi ble møtt med flere lass med søppel i inngangsområdet og lobbyen var sperret med stilaser og plastforheng. Arbeidet var også ganske høylytt. Servicen og beliggenhet var egentlig ganske bra| men det kom dessverre litt i skyggen av alt kaoset...,Sep 11| 2018,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
hotel tres bruyant et encombre a cause des travaux de renovation!les chambres sont faites tous les jours |aspirateur sur moquette 1 fois en 10 jours !!,Sep 10| 2018,2,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
Das Hotel liegt super und Manhattan lässt sich von dort in alle Richtungen erkunden - vieles auch zu Fuß. Frühstücksmöglichkeiten gibt es ausreichend in der Umgebung. Was. Ich optimal war: Wir hatten ein Vier-Bett-Zimmer - zwar mit Blick aufs Empire State Building| aber sehr sehr klein. Es gab keinen Platz| die Koffer abzustellen. Außerdem wurde das Hotel während unseres Aufenthalts renoviert. In der Hotel Lobby sah es chaotisch aus. Wir haben zudem zum Teil ewig auf den Aufzug warten müssen| weil permanent Handwerker und Hotelpersonal ebenfalls damit unterwegs waren. Vielleicht gibt es ja im Normalfall einen dritten Aufzug - wir haben ihn nicht gesehen. Trotzdem können wir das Hotel wegen Lage und Sauberkeit empfehlen.,Sep 1| 2018,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

O quarto era pequeno porém muito confortável.

Séjour de 3 jours. Hotel localisé tout près d'une station de métro et de plusieurs restaurants et commerces d'alimentation. Situé à distance de marche des principales attractions: Times Square| Central Park et même le World Trade Center pour les plus en forme. Chambre petite| un peu désuète mais propre et avec une excellente literie et un poste de télévision de bonne dimension. Pour un léger supplément| on peut aussi avoir vue sur l'Empire State Building| situé à proximité. À part les inévitables bruits de portes qui claquent et les personnes qui ne peuvent pas s'empêcher de parler fort dans les corridors| même tard| j'avoue que les chambres entre elles sont bien insonorisées et que nous y avons fort bien dormi. Personnel courtois et discret: merci pour le traditionnel biscuit à l'arrivée et le bon entretien des chambres. J'ajoute le tarif plus que raisonnable du stationnement publique juste en face de l'entrée à 33.$ US/jour: ne pas oublier de faire tamponner le carton de stationnement avant de quitter l'hôtel pour bénéficier de ce tarif préférentiel.,Mar 12| 2018,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

When we arrived there were no reservation for us so we recieved an other room. It did not meet the standard we had booked. The cleaning was not so good| l lot of dust in the corners and the bahroom was freezing cold. The heating was very noise. The bed was good and also the location Close to Metro| Penn Station and shopping.,Jan 8| 2018,3,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001

Meine Mutter und ich waren im Dezember 2017 dort. Das Zimmer ist völlig in Ordnung und auch super sauber. Nur die Heizung ist unglaublich laut. Für Leute die einen nicht ganz so tiefen Schlaf haben| werden aufwachen wenn die Heizung anspringt. Man kann sie auch komplett ausschalten| dann kühlt das Zimmer aber recht schnell aus.,Dec 23| 2017,4,DoubleTree by Hilton New York City - Chelsea,128 West 29th Street| New York| NY| 10001
O lobby do hotel precisa de uma reforma| muito antigo. A frente do hotel estava suja.
