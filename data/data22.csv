Hotel is in a perfect location| a few blocks from Millennium Park on the lake. The common areas are a little cramped as they tend to be in cities but the room was not.,Aug 18| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
This property  is an old office building  turn into a beautiful  hotel.,Aug 18| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
Great location in the theatre district!  Parking is a few blocks down.  Room was nice.  Portia who worked at the front desk was incredibly accommodating and helpful.,Aug 17| 2021,4,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

The location was amazing! Shopping lots of places to eat in the convenience of walking distance was perfect. The staff was super friendly and mattress was great. The only thing that was a disappointment was having to request housekeeping daily. The lack of access to housekeeping was a bit frustrating. I Had to constantly reach out to get more toiletries and towels. And when they bright new ones came| I even had to ask them to do obvious tidying up like emptying the trash cans or disposing of old towels left on the floor. I would have preferred requesting housekeeping service at the beginning of my stay once rather than having to constantly request it.,Aug 14| 2021,3,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
Overall great location and great parking that is 2 blocks away but great price. Comes with free breakfast. Not bad of a hotel. TV wouldn’t work most of the time. Just a good budget place.,Aug 14| 2021,4,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

One needs an eagle eye to find the hotel as it blends into a  theater facade next door. Once “discovered”| however| the hotel and staff are great. It’s an older facility but well maintained and accommodating. AND it’s central: an easy walk to the Chicago Art Institute| Lake Michigan and its parks| the Chicago Symphony and a variety of restaurants.,Aug 13| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
The room was spacious| especially for a Chicago hotel. The location was great as it was within walking distance of the loop and had several restaurants within walking distance. The room was clean and comfortable. The free breakfast was nice and had a good number of options.,Aug 12| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
The newly-remodeled room was spacious. The bedding was super comfortable.  The provided breakfast was a step above the typical continental breakfasts of cereal| Danish and coffee provided at other hotels.  The accessibility to attractions and public transportation was superb.,Aug 10| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

Beautiful building| love the area| the staff was wonderful| we'll stay here again.,Aug 5| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
The rooms/bath were spacious and clean.  The lobby| breakfast area| however| need to be updated.  The chairs and tables are old and broken.  The material on the chairs is coming apart and in awful condition.  The breakfast food is not good.,Aug 1| 2021,3,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
The best thing about this hotel is location location location. It is right next to 2 major L trains and almost every bus in the city stops on the corner; so if you plan to use public transport| it's a great choice. Also| it is in the middle of everything| walking wise. So if the Loop attractions and restaurants are your jam| this is great. The service is also good. The people are nice| and they are responsive to request. Now the less good parts: this is an old property that clearly has not been updated in ages. This means the decor is ancient| dark| and it all feels dingy (our room was nothing like the picture). The mattresses are also old| and quite uncomfortable. I woke up repeatedly every night| and had hip pain by the end. And the sheets are old| so they don't fit the mattress. Stretch them as you may -- they come off at multiple corners every night...And finally| the faucet design is such that it is at the very edge of the sink| meaning whenever you use it| water is all over the counter and your stuff. Dumbest design I have ever seen. In short| if your goal is sightseeing and you plan to spend minimal time in the hotel| and if you are a good sleeper| able to deal with some discomfort| this is the place for you. If you are more touchy about decor and your bedding--not for you.,Jul 30| 2021,4,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

The staff here is amazing. Honestly the nicest staff I have ever encountered. Even when we arrived  at three in the morning| the night clerk| Oscar| was outstanding with his service and personality. The hotel is perfectly located in the loop| one half block from the train line. Everything is walkable| and convenient.The rooms need a little attention. The bathroom door did not lock and you have to push the front door hard to be able to engage the deadbolt| but over all it was perfect and these didn’t bother me too muchThe hotel is a historic building directly adjacent to a theater. In 1905 it was the tallest building in Chicago. They have kept cool vintage artifacts in place for visitors to appreciate.Breakfast was ok. Not many items for those with Celiac disease. Basically hard boiled eggs and fruit.For those that can eat gluten| there is a waffle maker| sandwich’s| sausage| omelettes| cereal| etc.The breakfast attendant was exceptional. Even while we ate| she asked if she could get us anything else. That’s excellent service.I WILL stay here again.,Jun 24| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

The staff was incredibly nice and helpful. I couldn't say enough good things about them. If I could give them ten stars I would. Parking is only $20 in garage but it is a block our so away. Upon arrival parked right in front of building (not between valet signs) and checked in before moving car to garage. Same when the trip ended. Retrieved car from garage and parked in front of hotel to load our luggage. Breakfast wasn't much and it was cold. Confusing entrance to building. You enter on the left side and lobby is not on the ground floor. Get on the elevator and select lobby button. Also| hotel should clean the outside of windows in rooms.

The staff was incredibly nice and helpful. I couldn't say enough good things about them. If I could give them ten stars I would. Parking is only $20 in garage but it is a block our so away. Upon arrival parked right in front of building (not between valet signs) and checked in before moving car to garage. Same when the trip ended. Retrieved car from garage and parked in front of hotel to load our luggage. Breakfast wasn't much and it was cold. Confusing entrance to building. You enter on the left side and lobby is not on the ground floor. Get on the elevator and select lobby button. Also| hotel should clean the outside of windows in rooms.

Stayed for one night at the beginning of April. Good value for the location and property. Off site parking| around the corner 1 block| was the cheapest I’ve ever seen in Chicago. $20 for the night and good until 5 pm the next day.Hotel was clean and spacious. Larger room than many other hotels in the area I’ve stayed at. Free breakfast was also available. Overall a positive experience.

This hotel is very centrally located in the heart of the Theater district. It is a quick 8-10 minute walk to Millennium Park one way| 8-10 minute walk to Sears Tower| and 15 minute walk to the Mag Mile.

The staff were all very professional| check in and out was easy and contactless| rooms were clean and had a mini frig. With Covid| the breakfast is a box with yogurt| fruit| a bagel| and a bottled water. It was convenient to take on our adventures. Since there is no room service| I would have liked if they checked on us to see if we needed more towels| shampoo| take out trash| toilet paper. etc| since we were there 5 nights.

My stay was excellent| rooms were perfectly clean and staff was amazing. I was scared to travel during this pandemic but the Hampton Inn made us feel comfortable and safe. We were able to check in early and check out late they also held our luggage since we had a late flight. You can also communicate with the front desk through text which I found so convenient & easy. They also offer complimentary toiletries you might of forgotten. No hot breakfast is being offered at the moment which we understand it’s for everyone’s safety| but they do offer breakfast to go bags which included fruit | granola bar| muffin or bread and some water which was perfect for us since there is no charge for it. Parking is not advertised as free there is a fee which can be a little pricey it was around $40-$45 a night. There is a $60 dollar deposit hold for each night you stay but was placed back into my account in minutes after checking out. Please do your reach when booking for any extra fees before being upset over charges if you have questions call the hotel. Over all my trip was amazing and I will definitely be booking my stay here again!,Aug 24| 2020,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
Hotel was clean. Expected a bath tub and not a just a shower but not a deal breaker. Room is not big but high ceilings and long windows and curtains made it seem spacious| especially with curtains open.  Great location| decent Italian restaurant down the street| McDonald's| and a few more. Stayed during covid 19 pandemic so lots of places are closed| ex. Restaurant right across the street.

My stay was excellent| rooms were perfectly clean and staff was amazing. I was scared to travel during this pandemic but the Hampton Inn made us feel comfortable and safe. We were able to check in early and check out late they also held our luggage since we had a late flight. You can also communicate with the front desk through text which I found so convenient & easy. They also offer complimentary toiletries you might of forgotten. No hot breakfast is being offered at the moment which we understand it’s for everyone’s safety| but they do offer breakfast to go bags which included fruit | granola bar| muffin or bread and some water which was perfect for us since there is no charge for it. Parking is not advertised as free there is a fee which can be a little pricey it was around $40-$45 a night. There is a $60 dollar deposit hold for each night you stay but was placed back into my account in minutes after checking out. Please do your reach when booking for any extra fees before being upset over charges if you have questions call the hotel. Over all my trip was amazing and I will definitely be booking my stay here again!,Aug 24| 2020,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
Hotel was clean. Expected a bath tub and not a just a shower but not a deal breaker. Room is not big but high ceilings and long windows and curtains made it seem spacious| especially with curtains open.  Great location| decent Italian restaurant down the street| McDonald's| and a few more. Stayed during covid 19 pandemic so lots of places are closed| ex. Restaurant right across the street. Staycation was great and staying at this hotel added to the relaxing weekend.,Aug 24| 2020,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

I thought parking was attached to building so that was disappointing having to walk from parking garage to hotel after a long day. The staff was friendly even though the receptionist was obviously very swamped. He stayed calm and collected the entire time and explained everything well. Kudos to him! The room was very clean even though they were also rushing to have available clean rooms for the guests. You could definitely tell they were short staffed.,Jul 5| 2020,4,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
Check-in too late| we had to wait for the room to get cleaned until 7 pm. The breakfast was terrible| a mini banana| a bottled water and a snack. This is the second time it happens at Hampton in. Not happy at all.,Jul 4| 2020,2,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
Although our stay was for only one night| it was extremely pleasant and accommodating. They were effective and efficient under the new guidelines and I could tell that they spared no expense with the cleanliness of their property.

This was the worst stay of our lives. We went to Chicago for valentines day weekend. This hotel does not have parking and the closest parking garage is three blocks away so if you're like me and can barely walk or move around this is very difficult. The price to valet is very expensive and it is not for the entire stay like we were told. It is per night. The comfort was awful and when we stayed I tried to use the blow dryer in the bathroom| when I turned it on It sparked and started smoking in my ands. luckly I didn't receive any injury sense I use my hands for work. When I told the lobby about the incident they sent up a dryer from housekeeping that smelt like burnt hair. I ended up having to use the plug in the room instead of the bathroom because the plug in the bathroom no longer worked. This is not a good place to stay if you are low on money. The only exception is that it is close to everything and the breakfast is different from other blahblah hotels.,Feb 17| 2020,1,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

There was a WONDERFUL selection for breakfast each morning. It was hot and fresh AND different each day!,Feb 5| 2020,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
Friendly staff| great breakfast| comfy room. It was in a good location for what we wanted to do and I didnt have to look at a Trump hotel marquee.  Stayed in room 708. The bathroom floor door stop was broken off. There was a rather sharp edge on it. I told the desk clerk about it.,Feb 4| 2020,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
It was the only property that didn’t have any staff to check in you at 12am. I have never experienced that in my life.

Excellent location and clean| comfortable room. Loved the cookies! Wish the hotel would invest in sustainable plates| cups and utensils for breakfast. It is time for hotels to stop investing in single-use items such as these| in the age of climate change.,Jan 4| 2020,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
This was our family holiday 'experience'| seeing Hamilton and staying at the Majestic. If you are seeing a show at the CBIC| stay at this hotel because you get amazing theater access. Our 2 Queen room was lovely - however| at the last minute one of my young adult daughters ended up not coming and I took my best friend along in her place| with one young adult daughter and my preteen son. I looked for a larger room to upgrade but didn't find anything. I did see an option to add a rollaway bed and figured that would at least give them some personal sleeping space. Unfortunately| the Hampton will NOT allow a rollaway if the room has 2 beds. I understand the premise but also found it very difficult. My young adult daughter opted for the floor| which I hated for a family experience in a beautiful (and expensive) hotel. I have to say that Porshce| at the front desk| was kind and welcoming and wanted to help us - she sent extra bedding and drinks - but my daughter still slept on the floor over this policy. Please give your very fine employees the discretion to act in accordance with common sense. We weren't trying to take advantage of the hotel| we were trying to make a once-in-a-lifetime experience comfortable for all of us.,Jan 3| 2020,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

While the customer-facing staff was very good| the housekeeping was bad in one important respect: our bed simply did not have sheets that fit it.  The supposedly fitted bottom sheet was too small for the mattress| which caused three of the four corners to come off.  That in turn caused a very uncomfortable rumpling of the bottom sheet.  The top sheet on our king size bed appeared to be a queen-sized sheet.  It could not be tucked in on the sides or the bottom| resulting in a sheet that simply laid on top of the bed.  There is no excuse for this.  Those two thing resulted in a very uncomfortable night.  When we complained| we got an apology| but no other accommodation.

Had a king size bed. The sheets were too small had to have them put on the correct ones. The breakfast for day 2 had no meat unusual,Aug 26| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

We missed our connecting flight and needed a room just for the night. We got there late and we very tired. The front desk clerk was very nice| telling us what was available to eat and when. I noticed they had a few snacks and amenities on display but didn't see the much desired toothbrush and toothpaste set. She noticed I was peering at the display and asked what I was looking for so I told her. She went in the back and came out with two toothbrushes and two toothpaste packets. She then gave us two water bottles and a whole bunch of snacks. I don't know if this is standard but it was very much appreciated. It made the unexpected delay a little better!,Aug 21| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

The hotel is old and a little dingy. There was nowhere to sit at breakfast. The sheets didn’t stay on the bed and I woke up on the bare mattress. The sheets were also very stiff and a little crusty. Valet was extremely expensive and never there when we pulled our car up| which caused quite a lot of stress. It is connected to the theater where we saw Hamilton which was amazing| but also extremely crazy out front of the hotel before and after each show. I would not stay here again.,Feb 20| 2019,3,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
We arrived in Chicago on early flight| took train into loop| had breakfast at iconic spot and took the grandgirls up to the top of Willis Tower to arrive at hotel before noon. We were given a spot to wait and refreshments while waiting for an early check-in. At the time of our matinee of Hamilton we were shown through an interior door to the lobby of the theater (avoiding the line outside). The room was very comfortable and very clean. The staff was very helpful. Overall this was a great stay!,Feb 18| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

The staff were so polite I don’t think I’ve ever stayed at a hotel with such polite staff before.,Feb 25| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
The hotel is old and a little dingy. There was nowhere to sit at breakfast. The sheets didn’t stay on the bed and I woke up on the bare mattress. The sheets were also very stiff and a little crusty. Valet was extremely expensive and never there when we pulled our car up| which caused quite a lot of stress. It is connected to the theater where we saw Hamilton which was amazing| but also extremely crazy out front of the hotel before and after each show. I would not stay here again.,Feb 20| 2019,3,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
We arrived in Chicago on early flight| took train into loop| had breakfast at iconic spot and took the grandgirls up to the top of Willis Tower to arrive at hotel before noon. We were given a spot to wait and refreshments while waiting for an early check-in. At the time of our matinee of Hamilton we were shown through an interior door to the lobby of the theater (avoiding the line outside). The room was very comfortable and very clean. The staff was very helpful. Overall this was a great stay!,Feb 18| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

Everyone was very friendly. The breakfast exceeded our expectations| and the convenience of being next to the CIBC theatre was fantastic. I will definitely stay here again. The only downside was continually waiting for the elevators.,Feb 14| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

Very clean hotel with cheerful| helpful staff. When we got to our room| the smoke detector was beeping. They sent a maintenance man right away and when he wasn't sure how long it might take| they immediately moved us to another room. Good breakfast with lots of choices. Went from lobby at Hampton directly in to the lobby of the cibc theatre. I highly re o.mend.this hotel.,Jan 30| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

Great stay! The room was very welcoming clean and quiet. The bed was comfortable and the staff was most helpful! The breakfast and breakfast area was delicious and clean. There was also coffee and fruit available all day which was amazing!!The hotel had a connecting door to the theater and they kept our luggage and coats safe for free at the Valet. We went through the connecting door it was wonderful!!!,Jan 24| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
Overall| we were pleased with our stay.  The location was great.  There were two items that we didn’t find to be ideal.  First| the mattresses were not as comfortable as a typical Hampton.  Also| the breakfast was heavy on pastries| fruit| and cereals.  I have stayed a Hampton Inn many times and they typically have at least a breakfast meat to hot with eggs and toast.,Jan 22| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
We went to Chicago to see Hamilton. This hotel is above the theater. Perfect! So convenient to just take the elevator to the show. Everyone else is waiting outside in the cold. The only complaint I have is the sheets were too small for the bed. I wrestled with the sheets and the slippery comforter all night. It kept sliding off the bed. Annoying! All else was great.,Jan 22| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

The valet guys were outstanding. Helped us out with explaining parking and got us into Hamilton at the CIBC theatre without having to go outside or wait in line. Very friendly. The front desk was very pleasant. Also had a very good hot breakfast. We pulled up in our car and the valet were there right away to get us all set. You have to pay $60.00 per day for parking but you have valet access to your car 24/7 as much as you need so decided that was a bargain for us.,Jan 22| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

The Hampton Inn Chicago Theater District was perfect for an overnight in Chicago with my daughter| primarily to see Hamilton. The price of $119| which includes breakfast was on budget. I skipped the valet parking ($56: although the valets were great| always with a friendly smile and hello) and opted to park just a few blocks away under Millennium Park for only $22! You need to PREPAY ONLINE and then scan the barcode (from your phone) when you leave the garage. The staff at the Hampton Inn were great! It is connected to the theater box office so we were able to easily pick up our tickets| walk back up to our room| get ready for dinner| walk less than 2 blocks to Italian Village for dinner and finally to Hamilton. We left our coats in our room because we didn't even need to walk outside to enter the theater!,Jan 16| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

We stayed here while visiting to see Hamilton. It is so convenient being that it is attached to the theatre. I read previous reviews that staff wasn’t pleasant| but thay wasn’t our experience at all. Everyone worker was helpful and welcoming. The breakfast was nice to have which was hard to find with hotels downtown. The location is also great for shopping| or needing items that you forgot-target and cvs is like 3 minutes from hotel. Its also a nice hotel if you’re traveling with children. I will definitely stay here again.,Jan 4| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

Our stay at the Majestic was amazing! We were close to everything we needed and wanted to do. The "L" train stop from O'Hare airport is literally around the corner so we could just take it in and walk to our hotel room without the trouble of renting a car or calling a cab. It is also immediately adjacent to the CIBC theater where we saw Hamilton and it was an incredible experience being so close! We even got to see the actors come out after the show as we were going to dinner.

Great location in the heart of the theater district| this hotel is within easy walking distance to Lake Michigan and all it has to offer. If you don't want to walk| you can hop on a Bird Bike. There is a hub within a block. There is plenty of shopping nearby and lots of choices in restaurants. Right next to CIBC Theater where we saw Hamilton.

If you are constantly on the go and not looking to stay in the hotel for very long periods of time| this hotel will be fine for your needs.  It definitely has that old style feel with updated rooms for the times.  For a king size bed room| it was too small to spend your vacation doing few things.  But it is Chicago so you probably do have a lot of things to do and so this type of hotel room will be fine.  The staff there is very nice though for the front desk and concierge services.,Jul 5| 2018,4,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

We were only in town for less than 24 hours. We had been given last minute tickets to Hamilton. I had never been to Chicago before. The hotel and the theater are in the same building! It is also located within safe and easy walking distance from the lake and Grant and Millenium Park.  Easily got to see cool sites as well as an amazing show.  Staff was superb|  and I can't shout out to the bell staff enough. Those guys were the BEST!!!!!

The location is great. Walking distance to anything in Chicago. Bed was fine. Breakfast was fairly standard. My only complaint is that there was a hair on the bar of soap in the box next to the bathroom sink. I'm guessing the bar was added back to the box after the previous guest left. Definitely made me question the cleanliness of everything else in the room.,Jan 31| 2018,4,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

The location is great. Walking distance to anything in Chicago. Bed was fine. Breakfast was fairly standard. My only complaint is that there was a hair on the bar of soap in the box next to the bathroom sink. I'm guessing the bar was added back to the box after the previous guest left. Definitely made me question the cleanliness of everything else in the room.,Jan 31| 2018,4,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

The hotel was booked and our toilet was broken.  The maintenance guy worked on it for about 30 min but it was pretty late at night so we told him he could just come back tomorrow after we checked out. We had to use the bathroom in the lobby.  They did comp part of our stay and were very appologetic.  Other than that the room was good.  It was close to everything we needed.  Would stay again.,Dec 31| 2017,3,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
It was -10 with the windchill on the day we went to see Hamilton. The connected lobby allowed us to get to our seats quickly without standing in line outside.

Easy access to anywhere in the loop or cross to the riverside. The subways are near by and all the main loop attractions. Comfortable bed and complimentary breakfast. Nice staff and safe place to stay.,Dec 29| 2017,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
Jnelli (sp?) helped us with our check in and accommodated our request to have rooms on the same floor.  The scent of fresh-baked cookies greeted us as we entered the lobby.  Each staff member we encountered was helpful and courteous.  The rooms were suprisingly large considering it is a botique hotel.  The beds were comfortable and the shower was lovely.  The small size of the hotel was perfect for being comfortable with letting our teens explore and hang out.  Since the hotel is connected to the theater where Hamilton was playing| it was nice to not have to wait outside in the cold - and our teens said that it was nice to be able to jump over to the hotel to use the restrooms during intermission instead of waiting in the long lines at the theater.  The breakfast was top notch: scrambled eggs| sausage| oatmeal| fruit| waffles| muffins| bagels| etc. with a nice selection of juices| coffee| teas; and the staff members who oversaw breakfast were helpful and took pride in what they offered.  The hotel had free Wi-Fi as well. Parking was my only challenge as the hotel had none| however| through ParkWhiz| we were able to book a 24 hour spot under the Palmer Hotel which was a short walk away - very convenient.  There is no pool at the hotel| but honestly| we don't stay in Chicago to swim! Millenium Park was three blocks away.  Several good restaurants were in close walking distancd too. We would stay at the hotel again.,Dec 28| 2017,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
The staff really went out of their way to solve issues for me. The location could not be better for theatre| the Christkindlmarket| the Art Institute and all the Xmas sights in the Loop.,Dec 28| 2017,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

We made our reservation for this trip in April. As we arrived at the airport and were getting settled in our rental car| we received a call from the hotel telling us they were overbooked and we were being moved to their sister location 20 mins. away. The hotel was in a very sketchy part of town. There was NO WAY we would have booked at this property on our own. Local public transit across the street ran every 10 mins. all night and we even heard gunshots in the wee hours of the morning. I would not take a chance with this hotel when the opportunity to move you is totally at their disposal.,Oct 5| 2017,1,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
Nice hotel in theatre district. Easy access to theatres| Millennial Park|stock exchange| federal buildings. Room was comfortable. It was clean but not pristine. Breakfast was good and was different on the 2 days I stayed. Fresh fruit| cookies| coffee| tea and ice water were always available. Valet parking was ridiculously expensive but there are many car rental agencies around and the red and blue lines are both easy walking distance. I would stay here again. Only downside is that there is no pool and it was terribly hit and muggy when we stayed.,Sep 23| 2017,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

Great hotel experience.  Highly recommend this hotel| especially if you are going to attend a show at the Privatebank Theatre.  We saw Hamilton and it was so perfect to be in this hotel.  Perks for the show - a door between hotel and theatre so you can skip the line waiting outside AND we were back in our room minutes after the show ended.  It was so worth not having to hail a cab at 10:30 in a crowd of people.Another great experience was the hotel staff.  They were very personal and polite.  We arrived in Chicago hours before check-in and were able to check-in early.  This was a great relief to us as my husband cannot be on his feet for long without a break.  Also gave our 9 year old a break in a busy day.Breakfast was great.  Lots of choices for hot or cold options.  Bacon| cheese omelettes| American fries| waffles with lots of options for sauces and whipped cream......great selection for all.Location was perfect.  We walked to Millennium Park.  Took a cab to American Girl as it was too hot to walk that many blocks.  Everything we planned to attend was within a mile or f the hotel location.  Rooms were clean and comfortable.  Good hotel security.  Needed room key to get to room floors in the elevator.  Would recommend this hotel.,Aug 24| 2017,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

We really enjoyed our stay. It is in a great location to a lot of attractions in downtown Chicago. We parked the car on arrival and walked everywhere we had planned to go.

We were surprising my granddaughter with tickets to the musical Hamilton and being at the hotel connected to the theater was an added bonus in addition to the hotel itself having everything you would expect from a Hilton Hotel.,Aug 17| 2017,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
We really enjoyed our stay. It is in a great location to a lot of attractions in downtown Chicago. We parked the car on arrival and walked everywhere we had planned to go. We loved being next to the private bank theater to see Hamilton. Free breakfast was pretty good. The only complaint was that the bed was super hard.,Aug 14| 2017,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
We enjoyed our stay.  Great location to the theatre district and south Michigan Avenue.   Breakfast area is very small and trouble finding seat to eat.  Food was good though.,Aug 14| 2017,4,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

Great value for the money. The staff is excellent| always ready to help out!! The amenities are overall condition are fine| not fancy| but they are adequate. I do like the historic building| modern decor and high ceilings! I wasn't a fan of the breakfast| but coffee and fruit are good to grab.,May 19| 2017,4,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

My daughter and I stayed here after attending a theatre performance next door.  The hotel was small and a little outdated| but it was clean and comfortable.  The hotel was very quiet which was a plus.  The breakfast buffet offered a good variety.  The staff accommodated my request to stay just a little past the checkout time.,May 14| 2017,4,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
When we knew we were going to take in "Hamilton" we decided to stay in the city overnight. We searched the hotels| and by chance found the Hampton Inn Majestic. While we could have found a less expensive hotel| why bother? We didn't even have to bring our coats| as the Hampton is right off the the theater's lobby. At the final curtain| all the rest of the audience was scrambling for their coats and to get to their parking garages| we just strolled back to our rooms. What a pleasure!,May 4| 2017,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
The location cannot be beat| especially for those of you seeing Hamilton!! Enjoy Chicago's theater district| shopping| and attractions from this great hotel.,May 2| 2017,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
The service (aside from Angel) was not that good. The staff wasn't that friendly within the hotel. The breakfast area is very tiny and the seats do not accommodate the amount of people/rooms they have. They only provided bagels with poppy seeds the second day. One of the beds in our room was lumpy and hard. The bellmen were fast and courteous.,May 1| 2017,4,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

Our stay at the Hampton Inn Majestic was great. The people at the hotel were friendly and professional.

Amazing experience.  Everyone| from the valet to the front desk| did all in their power to make the stay enjoyable.   The valet always made conversation and would open the doors for all who were using the doorways.  The valet would joke| but were more than efficient in getting their task done. The room was clean and the beds were extremely comfortable (my wife has a back issue so she is very sensitive to the bed).   The floor was full| but you could not hear the people in the other rooms| so it was easy to sleep without disruption. The location was amazing| a lot of great attractions within walking distance.  Beautiful old hotel that has retained a lot of the character from days gone by| while adding modern conveniences.  High ceilings in the rooms helped make the room feel large| adding to the feeling of comfort.The breakfast both mornings was good.  The eggs were well cooked| and the sausage gravy was actually very good.  Pleasantly surprised.,Feb 6| 2017,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

Meh. It was inexpensive and in a great location| but no maid service after our first day and really nothing in the way of amenities. There are many better choices in the area.,Nov 23| 2016,3,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

Muy agradable. En pleno centro downtown Chicago.  Un edificio antiguo con habitaciones modernas| a buen precio para el promedio de la zona. Viajamos en familia con dos niños. En la recepcion fueron muy atentos. Nuestro vuelo se retraso y llegamos a Chicago a las 6 AM por lo que perdimos la reserva que teníamos en otro hotel. Llegamos al hotel a las 9 AM y nos permitieron early check un después de casi un día sin dormir. Desayuno ejecutivo muy completo.,Aug 14| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603
룸은 전반적으로 사진과 같았고 위치는 괜찮았습니다. 대중교통이 가깝고 밀레니엄 공원과도 가깝습니다. 직원들은 친절하고 좋았습니다. 다만 욕실 머리카락과 바닥 구석의 부스러기 등 청소상태가 완벽해 보이진 않았고| 10시까지인 조식이 약 15분 전에 방문했을 때 이미 마감되어 있어서 아쉬웠습니다.,Aug 8| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District,22 W Monroe St| Chicago| IL| 60603

We enjoyed the close proximity to everything that this hotel provides.  The age of the building gives it both character and interest.  There isn't really a drawback to staying here if you aren't expecting extravagance.
