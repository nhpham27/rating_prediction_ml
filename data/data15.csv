Great view!  Enjoyable stay in a very pleasant room. Everyone was very helpful.,Aug 19| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

The breakfast staff was excellent and accomodating. The staff was helpful with feedback.,Aug 16| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036
Excellent location. Clean room. Good breakfast.,Aug 16| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036
Hotel was clean and staff was friendly. Didn’t like the fact that we had to park 2 streets over in a parking garage. No valet parking??? May be a Covid restriction. Otherwise we had a great stay in NYC.,Aug 16| 2021,4,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036
Not bad for the amount paid to stay| breakfast was a pleasant experience with a super friendly staff| Fatima was great!,Aug 15| 2021,3,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

We were very happy with our recent stay! Our room was a good size and clean upon arrival| the bed was very comfortable| and there was always a restock of towels in the hallway to grab at your convenience (housekeeping must be requested due to Covid). The continental breakfast in the morning was a little crowded| but decent. Besides the rude front desk assistance upon check-in| the rest of our front desk experiences throughout our 4 days was much better. I like that you needed your key card to open up the front doors of the hotel and to activate the elevator| which were added levels of security that made me feel safe. Central location to almost everything we did| shops| restaurants| etc. We could either walk to most of our destinations or hop on the subway from the entrance down the street. Overall| we were very satisfied with this hotel and would stay again in the future!,Aug 12| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036
We had few good items missing in the room when we arrived but the Evening team was excellent in helping us to get what we need. Two days after staying at the hotel| Management responded to our comment earlier and dropped off most and even extra items we needed since the day team ignored our request the first time. Kitchen team gave excellent service during breakfast.Location of the hotel is great.,Aug 12| 2021,4,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036
The hotel rooms are ok and clean| however the customer service staff particularly Chris was not not polite and not attentive to the customer requests| the management should take a preferrential attention and remind their staff to treat the customers rights.,Aug 11| 2021,3,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

Very close to Time Square! Nice parking nearby! Wonderful breakfast!!,Aug 9| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036
We chose this hotel based on the fact that I stay at Hilton hotels exclusively for work. The hotel is in a great location. However we didn't have our room cleaned for 2 of the 3 nights we were staying at the location. I had to go to the front desk and ask to have the room cleaned and for fresh towels. The front desk staff was Rachelle (sp) was often busy and or dismissive when I'd interact with her. Other staff members were wonderful however I'll spend a little more and stay at a nicer property next time I'm in Manhattan.,Aug 9| 2021,3,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036
All the stuff of the hotel were very friendly specially Fatima the lady that works at breakfast buffet was super friendly and greets everyone that walks in.,Aug 7| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036
Hotel was perfect! We stayed on the 28th floor with a city view.  Location was ideal to Times Square| subway and restaurants.  We loved our stay!,Aug 6| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

We stayed here for almost a week and had two rooms. Being close to Times Square on the more affordable scale than the big ritzy plaza hotels| it fit the bill. The rooms were good| but even with the windows closed there was more street noise than expected| especially the jackhammer taking out part of the sidewalk across the street behind Aladdin at 2am (not the hotels fault). I'm not sure where the fire department was from the hotel| but sirens were every hour or twice an hour| maybe something I should have expected more of in NYC| but earplugs would have helped with nightly noise. The shower size was good and the hot water never failed. All the towels and linens were white and freshly washed. We used the guest laundry in the basement and that worked out well. They do not sell laundry soap and they should sell the one load boxes as a matter of convenience. The hotel has been renovated| but you could see they struggle to keep up with the cleanliness. They have a lot of rooms| a lot of guests and not a lot of employees. At times the counter is only staffed by one person| making check-in or out difficult. We wanted a receipt at checkout| but one person and ten guests in line is discouraging. Getting our rooms cleaned during the week was not an option. They were only doing checkouts. We were able to get fresh towels| sheets| pillows| keys or whatever we needed| but we had to clean our own room| manage our own garbage and did our best to live up to the low footprint green ideas.,Jul 30| 2021,3,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

Very disappointing!! First stay in New York since Covid and the rooms have gone to poop!  Literally. Poop. There is a fluid smell in the rooms and the toilet and the showers backed up. Asked to be moved to a new room and was told they couldn’t til someone checked out. No refund available either. Asked how to see some sites that were further downtown and was told to ask someone at the subway….,Jul 19| 2021,2,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

Very centrally located in times square. Staff was very friendly and helpful when asking for directions.  My only real complaint is never once did house keeping come to our room  to make beds or give us fresh towels. Not sure if that was due to covid restrictions? We seen housekeeping around and figured they would come eventually. We helped ourselves to towels from their cart that was always kept right outside our room.,Jul 2| 2021,4,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

We helped ourselves to towels from their cart that was always kept right outside our room.,Jul 2| 2021,4,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

We had a nice stay overall.  They did have a nice breakfast| but we're not always prompt at getting items restocked.  They ran out of things towards the ending time and did not restock even though there was a line.  They have 3 elevators to service 30  floors so we had to wait at times to get an elevator.Due to COVID-19| they are not doing daily cleaning but it is available if you ask.,Jun 28| 2021,4,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036
The location was great! We walked to most places we were looking to go! We did not know that that the roof top was for public access| so only checked it out on the morning we left.

All of the computer services and facilities were available. Breakfast is free and wonderful. The only complaint is not with Hampton but the city of New York which is much dirtier than a few years ago.,Jun 28| 2021,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

We had a great stay here. Our room was clean| check in and check out was fast & super nice| beds were comfortable and we felt this hotel was serious about Covid. Breakfast was better than expected. They validate our garage parking so ended up paying only $42/night. They even gave us a closet to keep our luggage after checkout which was a great help.

Nothing fancy about the place| but it was okay. The room size was normal. You need to ask to get the housekeeping to come clean. Location is perfect| very close to the Times square. Free breakfast was either bagel with cream cheese or pre-made biscuit sandwich (egg| cheese| sausage) that you would microwave for 1 minute| juices| coffee| and fruits. No bar or restaurant in the hotel. The best part of this hotel was that they have laundry room. $2 for washer and $2 for dryer (quarters needed).

Very close to Times Square. Clean. Quiet. The elevators were very much an issue. It could take 15-20 minutes to get an elevator. They had three. Only two were working.

Pro: The location and the staff that served breakfast was very great. You need a key card to get in the front door and their is a night security guard. Con: Breakfast was yogurt| fruits| hard boiled eggs| packaged oatmeal| bagels| juice| and coffee. Every floor and the elevator smelled like weed| not good for families. When we first got to the room it was not very clean and a half drunk water bottle was left by the window. House keeping only comes after the third day| and you have to request it a day in advance. Which we scheduled a day in advanced and no one came to clean it. Several times I call the hotel operator/ front desk the phone just ranged and no one answered.

So let me just start off by saying that as an ex-employee I have always stayed with Hampton Inns because I’ve believed in the brand. It’s budget friendly| clean| & the staff has always gone above and beyond. I’m highly familiar with Hilton brand standards & that’s why I choose to stay with Hampton/Hilton brands. The room was super cute & stylish. Take note that the below pictures are unacceptable & this is something that needs to be reviewed in a huddle. We are in the middle of COVID & leaving a soap from a prior guest is just wow. Also| if you assure a request is to be filled but don’t follow through| your guests are going to be disappointed| just as I was. Only thing done right was having a city view—so thank you for that.,Nov 23| 2020,3,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

Hotel is an okay choice if you're looking for an inexpensive stay near Times Square.  The staff were all very nice and welcoming. However| the breakfast was a joke unless you have kids who like box cereal. For my taste artifical coffee creamers are a non starter but thankfully Starbucks is a few blocks away on 8th Ave.,Aug 3| 2020,3,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

This was a great place to stay for the money. Everything was nice and clean....from the hotel lobby to the rooms. It was a nice place to retreat to after site seeing.   Oh....and the staff were very professional and friendly. Conveniently located to everything you need and attractions to see ! I plan to stay here again on my next trip to New York.,Jul 14| 2020,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036
My room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. It’s a nice contemporary space. The only annoyances were from other guests on my floor. They were celebrating someone’s birthday and people kept coming in and out of the room during really late hours. I could hear the door slam each time. Also people kept having conversations in the hall. These things made it difficult for me to get to sleep. I came there for peace and quiet and an escape from my family during this long period of quarantine so that was a bit disappointing. The free breakfast was mostly coffee| muffins| orange juice and cereal. It would’ve been nice to have a hot breakfast. The staff was friendly and helpful. Easy check in and check which took less than 5 minutes each time. Overall I mostly enjoyed my stay. I'd stay here again. Hopefully next time I’ll have better neighbors.,Jul 13| 2020,4,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036
King size bedrooms are small. Can’t connect anything to the tv and they are old as well.

I loved the little things the staff did like text me before check-in to see if I needed help with anything. Lilly was especially helpful. The location is awesome and breakfast was good. The carpeting (apparently carpet squares) in the rooms is oddly thin and has a cheap pattern that brings down the entire experience. The towels are also thin. But| the bed was comfortable| and the room was quiet. The elevators can be slow.  I was also disappointed that the hotel would not agree to let me cancel and rebook when I accidentally selected the wrong room type| even though I was trying to get 2 rooms and we would be there for 4 days in one of them| and they would not have lost any money. Staff had no discretion. Overall| it was good and I would stay there again. Be aware that there are 2 basic room types at least on the upper floors - one has a hallway and the other does not. Also| be advised that if you choose a nonrefundable rate| they really truly mean it.,Mar 18| 2020,4,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

We've stayed 7 nights and all was good| the location is very handy and close to metro and Times Square.

It was a two night weekend stay in NYC. We were checked in immediately upon our arrival| without waiting.  Staff was quick and accommodating. The hotel was very clean and updated| comfortable rooms and beds| very close and walking distance to almost tourists points of interest| just few steps on time square subway station| and blocks away from Time Square| with great restaurants around.  Excellent full buffet breakfast daily in the lobby with lot of choices| fresh fruits and fresh 100% juices| bacon| sausages| eggs| lot of  good and delicious pastries| the 24 hour variety of coffees and tea’s in the lobby| with 24 hr drinking water. Toilet and bathrooms were clean| with regular refilling and changing of clean towels and toiletries without asking them. Quiet room for us| so we had a nice sleep all our stay. And the view was excellent| overlooking the city. Elevator wise? We didn’t experienced any long wait even if we were in the 19th floor. Price was cheap if you consider the all services that was provided. There was a $20 security deposit per night| but as soon as we checked out| it was automatically returned back. So we only paid the rate we got from hotel.com. We enjoyed our stay in this Hotel. Excellent in NYC.

The location of the hotel is great. We were within walking distance of many places we needed or wanted to go. We were close to the ABC studios| we walked to Central Park| we walked to the Sightseeing Ferry Boat Pier| and there is a Walgreens for knick-knacks near. There are many great restaurants around and a McDonald's across the street if you like. The staff was friendly. There are no microwaves in the room| but there is one in the lobby area that can be used to warm up food. Housekeeping did a great job with daily service. Also| there is great value in breakfast being included as that is one meal you don't have to buy. Most of the other hotels in the area does not include breakfast. The breakfast room was crowded each morning though| but that is to be expected if the hotel is full. The rooms are smaller than usual but that is also to be expected in New York. The elevators took you up and down quickly. All in all| my family and I were pleased with this hotel.,Jan 25| 2020,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

The location of the hotel is great. We were within walking distance of many places we needed or wanted to go. We were close to the ABC studios| we walked to Central Park| we walked to the Sightseeing Ferry Boat Pier| and there is a Walgreens for knick-knacks near. There are many great restaurants around and a McDonald's across the street if you like. The staff was friendly. There are no microwaves in the room| but there is one in the lobby area that can be used to warm up food. Housekeeping did a great job with daily service. Also| there is great value in breakfast being included as that is one meal you don't have to buy. Most of the other hotels in the area does not include breakfast. The breakfast room was crowded each morning though| but that is to be expected if the hotel is full. The rooms are smaller than usual but that is also to be expected in New York. The elevators took you up and down quickly. All in all| my family and I were pleased with this hotel.,Jan 25| 2020,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

Staff overall was very friendly and helpful but the room was a bit small. The bathroom door was a barn door style and did not close or seal adequately making doing business In the bathroom a very interesting topic of discussion for those not in the bathroom.Lobby was a bit small and did not have much space to lounge around. The included breakfast was adequate. Endless coffee was definitely a plus. Would recommend providing a reusable mug for all to use and eliminate paper cups... after noting 30 plus paper cups we used over just 5 days.

Before we even arrived your staff sent me a welcome text to let me know they were expecting me and if I needed anything to let them know. Upon arrival and during my entire stay the staff was extremely friendly| helpful and never once without a smile on their faces. A few years ago we stayed here and Tobo was awesome. My kids begged me to stay here again and we did and Tobo was still there and remembered us. He and all the staff took great care of us. The hotel is in a perfect location to Times Square and subway stations. Valet is wonderful and the property is extremely clean| secure and comfortable. The services offered for free and the knowledgeable staff make getting around and figuring out where to eat| what to do and how to get there easy. Housekeeping is top notch!

This was one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. I'll number the reasons. 1) 24-hour check-in. Unlike most hotels that only allow check-in after 3 p.m.| this hotel offers check-in at any time. That's awesome because waiting until 3 p.m. to check-in is a waste of half of the day! 2) Staff is super nice. I am deaf and travel alone| but the front desk workers (sorry| I didn't get their names) were super nice and one of them even know sign language! 3) The rooftop terrace is AMAZING. The hotel really need to promote this terrace. It is beautiful. You can use your key card to access it| I think from 8 p.m. to 8 p.m. 4) When you first get to your room| do not sit on the bed. Do not lie/lay on the bed. Don't even look at the bed. The beds are SO comfortable that you will not want to leave the room at all. 5) I have mobility issues and just an FYI to anyone else - the bathroom floor is super slippery with bare feet. But to be clear - this is not the hotel's fault in ANY way. It's my bum feet. 6) The Expedia listing doesn't mention it but there is a $40 deposit required| but that is super cheap compared to other hotels and it was back in my account in a day or two after I checked out. 7) The location is AMAZING. Very close to Times Square and a subway entrance but also far enough away not to be super crowded. 8) FREE hot breakfast in the mornings! Unheard of in NYC.

This was one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. I'll number the reasons. 1) 24-hour check-in. Unlike most hotels that only allow check-in after 3 p.m.| this hotel offers check-in at any time. That's awesome because waiting until 3 p.m. to check-in is a waste of half of the day! 2) Staff is super nice. I am deaf and travel alone| but the front desk workers (sorry| I didn't get their names) were super nice and one of them even know sign language! 3) The rooftop terrace is AMAZING. The hotel really need to promote this terrace. It is beautiful. You can use your key card to access it| I think from 8 p.m. to 8 p.m. 4) When you first get to your room| do not sit on the bed. Do not lie/lay on the bed. Don't even look at the bed. The beds are SO comfortable that you will not want to leave the room at all. 5) I have mobility issues and just an FYI to anyone else - the bathroom floor is super slippery with bare feet. But to be clear - this is not the hotel's fault in ANY way. It's my bum feet. 6) The Expedia listing doesn't mention it but there is a $40 deposit required| but that is super cheap compared to other hotels and it was back in my account in a day or two after I checked out. 7) The location is AMAZING. Very close to Times Square and a subway entrance but also far enough away not to be super crowded. 8) FREE hot breakfast in the mornings! Unheard of in NYC. This hotel is basically completely perfect.,Oct 10| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

Great location but the lifts are terrible ....they are inadequate and when it’s busy expect to be waiting for several minutes and to be packed into the small lift space when you do manage to get one,Sep 14| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036
The room key card we were given did not work. We had to go back to the desk to get it replaced three times. It was annoying getting stuck in the elevator going to the highest floor because the key card does not work| then going back and forth to the front desk to get it replaced.,Sep 13| 2019,2,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036
Fantastic place to stay and it's right next to Times Square| we were on the top floor (31st) and it was free from the noise of traffic. Rooms were clean and well looked after on a daily basis. The most notable part of the stay were the staff| from the breakfast staff to the concierge to cleaners| everyone was polite and happy to see you| they greeted you every time they saw you and made you feel very welcome. The breakfast choices were fine| from cereals| to waffles| bakery| fresh fruits and all sorts of beverages. Only slightly negative thing is the wait times for the lifts can be a bit long at times| especially during breakfast time| however that is a minor point.  There is also a private roof top view which is a bonus.,Sep 12| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036
Location was good as it was in the heart of Times Square.  There was street noise due to traffic| sirens etc. Air con in room.

Although I didn't need any extra assistance| I observed the manager several times helping others.  Enough so| that it made an impression on me.

The location of this hotel is great| near everything| and it includes a decent free breakfast| and 24/7 Coffee bar in the lobby. The staff is friendly| efficient| and helpful! I only wish that the rooms had a refrigerator.

Great location and good basic breakfast and free coffee all day long!,Aug 9| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036
I stayed here with my daughter and 2 of her friends to celebrate her birthday! It was a great location| covenient to everything. The hotel was clean and so was our room. My daughter was only 3 1/2 weeks post ACL surgery and still really wanted to go on this trip. She thought crutching around wouldn’t be “too bad” she was pretty miserable fast and when I inquired at the hotel about where I could possibly rent a wheel chair they told me they had one we could borrow! It was fantastic and definitely made our trip more comfortable and made it easier for us to get around. The customer service was great!,Aug 9| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

The hotel itself was clean and vibrant. The room was also clean but very small. The pillows were way too soft and they just collapsed when i laid on them. I could feel the zipper of the pillow thru the case and it scratched me all night. The mattress was a VERY firm king sized coil mattress that was just plain awful. I slept a maximum of 4 hours each night because of the amount of uncomfortable I was. We opted for the “do not disturb” sign so our room was never cleaned which is fine but the room was never supplied with garbage bags before we arrived. Guest accommodations was very helpful throughout the entire stay. Front desk was nice. Breakfast was disgusting. Best part about the stay was that there was a subway entry right across the street.

The hotel is located in a perfect spot| the breakfast is good but the housekeeping could be better | our room one day was fixed at 6 pm and they left no sheet in our beds.,Aug 1| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036
Superb!!!! The staff is simply terrific. Always helpful and friendly. Whenever we called for something for the room (towels| etc.) it always came quickly and friendly. The hotel itself was very clean upon arrival and during our stay. The hotel was very busy by the way. July. The breakfast is phenomenal for a "free breakfast". Once morning i spilled food on my shirt and one of the nice staff happened to notice| offered to get a bottle of water to help remove the stain. Everyone always spoke with a good morning and good night or how are you today. My only very small complaint was the pillows but| my husband says I am am tough critic on pillows because I have neck issues. We already have plans to visit NYC again soon and will be booking here.,Aug 1| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

타임즈스퀘어 및 맨하탄 중심지와 가까우면서도 조용한 호텔. 무료로 제공하는 아침식사 때문에 아침 시간을 더 효율적으로 사용할 수 있었음. 호텔 로비의 커피도 하루 종일 무료 제공. WOW. 직원들 모두 밝고 친절함. 객실은 크지 않지만 잘 정리되고 깔끔함. 약간의 에어컨 소음과 체크아웃 시간대의 엘리베이터 타는 것은 조금 어려웠음. 하지만 그 이외의 장점이 너무나 큰 호텔. 다시 뉴욕에 간다면 다시 숙박하고 싶은 추천 호텔.,Jul 20| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

Location was basically just one street away from Times Square| but the street the hotel is on is quiet. Everything we wanted to see in the area was within walking distance and there were subway stops nearby for anyone who wants to venture further out. I was pleasurably surprised by the size of the hotel room after hearing about tiny NY hotel rooms - our room was a very good size. Beds were comfortable and room was very clean.

Elevators were either extremely slow or always full so we had to walk up 7 flights of stairs multiple times a day.

The room was a bit small for what I paid| but it was close to Times Square without being in the middle of the crowds. It was close to so much I wanted to do and see. The breakfast was the only thing I had to complain about. The coffee was really bitter and I put creamer and sugar in. There weren't many options. I went for the scrambled eggs and they were SO watery. The bed and pillows were very comfortable.

Breakfast is very good with lots of variety and fresh fruit. Nice refreshment area in lobby for free coffee tea and water Great location walked to Empire State Building you could walk to the intrepid . We walked to time square it’s very close and Central Park it’s a bit of a hike likely a mile,Jul 5| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036
The room was a bit small for what I paid| but it was close to Times Square without being in the middle of the crowds. It was close to so much I wanted to do and see. The breakfast was the only thing I had to complain about. The coffee was really bitter and I put creamer and sugar in. There weren't many options. I went for the scrambled eggs and they were SO watery. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. My home bed and pillows felt super hard in comparison.,Jul 4| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

Location was great with easy access to Time Square and Broadway shows| but know that you will hear sirens| music| etc and see lights at all times of the day! Our "city view" was more like the tops/sides of buildings| which was slightly different than marketed. The service was great| and employees were helpful and kind.

This is our second time to stay at this hotel. The location is superb.

Great location.The only problem as usual are other rude guests. The hotel doors are very heavy which I guess is to make them secure. The problem is if you do not hold the door it will SLAM. So imagine every inconsiderate guest not holding their door and just letting it slam repeatedly at all hours.This is not the hotels fault.

We took a train into the city for dinner and a show.  Hotel was easy walking distance between Grand Central Station and the theater district.  We had a city view on a high floor that was wonderful even when it was snowing.  Would definitely stay here again.  The woman at the front desk was super friendly and helpful.,Mar 7| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

A+ on the staff.Everyone was welcoming and helpful. Excellent.The elevators were very challenging. They are inadequate for the peak loads.The breakfast needs some more whole grain low sugar options like nuts without sugar (the sliced almonds were good for the oatmeal| but would have been better without sugar). I appreciated the ability to turn off the room fan| but the bathroom fan was pretty noisy.Overall a good stay. Thanks|,Mar 6| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

The room was pretty roomy compared to other hotels.,Mar 6| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036
After a brief issue (first room was not clean)| which the staff handled immediately| our stay was excellent. Special shout-out to Geraldine M. who runs the breakfast room... she went above and beyond in making sure we had everything we needed and even staying to chat with us about our shared Irish heritage! She really made us feel at home and is a special person.I log dozens of room nights in hotels in a year| and it's this sort of personal attention that makes me want to return again and again.

A great hotel which ticked all our boxes for our trip- fantastic staff| breakfast included| good location. Our children loved the free cookies in the lobby each evening from 5pm| whilst myself and my wife enjoyed the free beverage station. It was great to come back into the lobby and make a cup of coffee after a long day of sightseeing in the cold.

We stayed Feb. 9 - 12| 2019 and the Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central exceeded our expectations!  The location is absolutely perfect!  You are surrounded by Broadway theaters| Times Square one block to the right| restaurant row one block to the left| and anything else you need all around; it just doesn't get better than that! The room was clean and fresh| the heating/air-conditioning worked perfectly| the bathroom was clean and bright (even the tile)| the bed was comfy| the bed linens were nice and the pillows gave plenty of choices to suit a variety of preferences. The breakfast was delicious and a great start to our days!  The service with a smile was prompt| courteous| and the bellman Luis Luna went above and beyond.  It was raining on our last day and he lent us umbrellas to use!  He held our luggage for us on check-out day| hailed the cab and loaded the luggage for us.  We had great conversations each time we passed through the lobby and needed something. Top Notch service! I would not hesitate to stay here again.

This was a short notice stay for my parents who were returning from a cruise and connecting travel (greyhound) was cancelled due to bad weather on the east coast (Boston). I have to say this hotel & staff are amazing!!! My 96yr old dad had a medical emergency just before leaving the ship resulting in a visit to the ER... We were reassured that the room would be available whenever they got there and then they were able to extend their stay an additional day on short notice at the same initial agreed rate!!! They get and Outstanding rating from Us!!!,Jan 22| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

Fabulous location right off Time Square. Can walk to everything. Staff was friendly and helpful with suggestions for shows| tickets| meals.

A top hotel. It was clean| warm and friendly. The staff were very helpful and were genuine in their service|nothing was to much trouble. Breakfast was great and saved us at least an hour each day. Check in and out was very well handled and fast.   The location was brilliant close to times square but away from the crowds. Free tea and coffee in the reception was much appreciated. The reception staff were knowledgeable about the surrounding area and again were very pleasant giving advice. The hotel was always being cleaned and polished. Safe deposit box in each room was useful.I have already recommended this hotel to others.,Jan 4| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

Also| my son left his laptop in the room after we checked out. Later on in the day I got a text from them letting me know that they had his computer and were holding it for us.

Situated in an ideal location!  A major subway stop directly across the street. Just blocks from Times Square| Broadway theaters| and some wonderful restaurants (both national chains and unique local ones). The hotel staff was always very polite and helpful. Check-in and check-out was a breeze. Complimentary breakfast had many tasty choices| plus fruit to take and enjoy during the day. Bottled water was available at the front desk when needed.  After a long day of sightseeing and evening activities| the complimentary tea| coffee and sometimes even a cookie were offered as a late night treat. I highly recommend trying this hotel.  It made a great impression on an out-of-towner like myself.,Dec 14| 2018,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

The location was perfect| right in the middle of everything. The room itself was what we expected for NY. Not much room| the sliding door for a bathroom was not ideal. You could hear everything! But the extra touches they try to make for comfort was nice. Complimentary Hot chocolate/tea/coffee on the main level was nice to have with the cool weather. The breakfast also has a very nice selection. Overall my sister and I would definitely choose this hotel again. In fact we ended up here because our first pick was awful!,Dec 11| 2018,4,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

Situated in an ideal location!  A major subway stop directly across the street. Just blocks from Times Square| Broadway theaters| and some wonderful restaurants (both national chains and unique local ones). The hotel staff was always very polite and helpful. Check-in and check-out was a breeze. Complimentary breakfast had many tasty choices| plus fruit to take and enjoy during the day. Bottled water was available at the front desk when needed.  After a long day of sightseeing and evening activities| the complimentary tea| coffee and sometimes even a cookie were offered as a late night treat. I highly recommend trying this hotel.  It made a great impression on an out-of-towner like myself.,Dec 14| 2018,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

The best thing about this hotel is the location. You will be at walking distance of almost every major attraction. However| for the price range| the hotel cramped rooms and lobby| long waiting periods for elevators| and horrible wifi are major dissapoint entes.

Pretty good| nothing special but no real complaints. It was clean| and it had everything advertised. The only issue is that the elevators were very disorganized - an elevator took several minutes to come| and they were small so not many people could fit. Often we would have to wait for 2-3 elevators before we could get on.,Oct 14| 2018,4,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036
We enjoyed our stay here. The staff was friendly and professional.  The complimentary breakfast was good but very busy ( will arrive earlier next time).  Hotel is very close to Port Authority Bus Terminal which is how we arrived.  Great location close to Times Square and walking distance to Madison Square Garden.

Fantastic location!!! We walked everywhere we needed to go other than a couple of subway treks just for the experience. Granted| we walk all the time (and run all the time) so it was no problem for us. We were just a couple of blocks away from Times Square. Food everywhere - just an awesome location. Room was a bit small - ended up having to put suit cases on the A/C unit| restroom was tiny...

Thank you to Farrell at the front desk and the housekeeping staff for having our room ready early when we arrived! The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The breakfast was great as well as the little touches such as the "to go" bags in the morning and snack at night. The location was perfect to Times Square and all the attractions.

Just returned after a week in this excellent very well located hotel. It was our first visit to New York and we couldn't have picked a better place to stay for its very convenient location to Broadway and Times Square to name just two. The room was very comfortable as was the bathroom and well equipped with everything you could need. The Buffet breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice and very well laid out. I'd like to give a special mention to the Breakfast Supervisor- Geraldine Meehan who really looked after us all week| 'thank you' Geraldine you are a lovely lady. All other members of staff were very friendly and helpful too . We will definitely stay here again .,Sep 16| 2018,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036
temperature control in the room was excellent! Be cautious of noisy neighbors as the walls are thin.

Lo que si me gusto son sus instalaciones. Se bien cuidado| seguro. El acceso es a través de la tarjeta magnética en la entrada| elevadores y el cuarto. El desayuno completo tipo buffet excelente. La atención en la recepción muy satisfactoria.Lo que no me gustó fue que no limpiaban el cuarto diariamente y tenías que decir en la administración que lo hicieran.Mencionan que por Covid se ha restringido el acceso a los cuartos. Pero te dabas cuenta de esta política pasados dos días cuando avisabas en la recepción. Inclusive un día dejé la instrucción y aún así no lo hicieron| Deberían dejar una nota sobre la cama cuando uno llega por primera vez para que uno tome sus precauciones debidas. Quizá falta que agreguen un frigo en el cuarto| porque a veces uno quiere guardar una bebida o agua.Yo si volvería al Hampton Inn.,Jul 31| 2021,3,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

Alles in allem sehr zu empfehlen aufgrund der TOP-Lage| die meisten U-Bahn-Linien sind in der Nähe. Frühstück ist ok wenn auch auf Pappe und und mit Plastikbesteck. Einziger Negativpunkt: das Wasser in unserem Zimmer (23. Etage ) wurde erst nach ca. 8-10 Min. einigermaßen warm! Das geht gar nicht! Soviel Wasser zu verschwenden vor jedem Duschen ist nicht ok. Positiv: die kostenlosen Getränke in der Lobby| Cookies| morgens die Frühstückstüte.,Mar 8| 2020,4,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

Esta é a 5a vez que me Hospedo em Hotéis em Nova Iorque sempre em hotéis diferentes| o Hampton sem dúvida é de longe o melhor custo benefício. Ótima localização| ótimo café da manhã que a maioria não oferece| quartos novos e bem cuidados| excelente recepção e atendimento dos funcionários no modo geral. Duas das minhas encomendas chegaram antes do dia da minha entrada e logo que realizei o Check-in já fizeram questão de localizar minhas encomendas sem que eu as solicitasse| ou seja extremamente organizado.

Alles in allem sehr zu empfehlen aufgrund der TOP-Lage| die meisten U-Bahn-Linien sind in der Nähe. Frühstück ist ok wenn auch auf Pappe und und mit Plastikbesteck. Einziger Negativpunkt: das Wasser in unserem Zimmer (23. Etage ) wurde erst nach ca. 8-10 Min. einigermaßen warm! Das geht gar nicht! Soviel Wasser zu verschwenden vor jedem Duschen ist nicht ok. Positiv: die kostenlosen Getränke in der Lobby| Cookies| morgens die Frühstückstüte.,Mar 8| 2020,4,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

Esta é a 5a vez que me Hospedo em Hotéis em Nova Iorque sempre em hotéis diferentes| o Hampton sem dúvida é de longe o melhor custo benefício. Ótima localização| ótimo café da manhã que a maioria não oferece| quartos novos e bem cuidados| excelente recepção e atendimento dos funcionários no modo geral. Duas das minhas encomendas chegaram antes do dia da minha entrada e logo que realizei o Check-in já fizeram questão de localizar minhas encomendas sem que eu as solicitasse| ou seja extremamente organizado.

Mukava perustason hotelli erittäin hyvällä sijainnilla. Todella mukava henkilökunta. Aamiainen oli yllättävän ok| vaikka tarjoiltiinkin kertakäyttöastioista ja hetkittäin ruokailutila kävi kovin ahtaaksi. Hissit ruuhkautuivat helposti.

Vielen Dank an das Frühstücksteam| das unseren Geburtstag so toll überrascht hat. Frühstück ist mehr als ausreichend. Klar| es ist amerikanisch| also mit Waffeln| Toasts| Smoothies etc.| aber das sollte einem bei einem Urlaub in den USA klar sein... einziges Manko: zu wenig Tische im Frühstücksraum und das Einweg Plastik Geschirr.

뉴욕에서 이정도 위치에 조식포함 이가격이면 가성비 최고인 듯 해요.여러 지하철역이 가까워 뉴욕 여기저기를 편리하게 이용했고| 브로드웨이에서 딱 한블럭 떨어져서 너무 시끄럽지도 않으면서 구경도 잘했어요. 생긴지 얼마 안되어 시설도 깨끗하고| 체크아웃 후 짐을 보관해줘서 마지막날도 편하게 여행했어요.시티뷰 룸에서 묵었는데 브로드웨이 아닌 반대편 뷰이긴 해도 하늘과 멀리 있는 높은 건물들이 보여서 답답하지 않았어요.,Oct 14| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

Mukava perustason hotelli erittäin hyvällä sijainnilla. Todella mukava henkilökunta.

立地はタイムズスクエアから5分とかからない場所です。初めてのNYで便利な立地が分からず、口コミだけで選びましたが、口コミ通りロビーの雰囲気は和やか、スタッフはフレンドリーと感じの良いホテルでした。部屋も清潔でした。欲を言えばシャワー圧が物足りないくらいです。ロビーの無料のクッキーとコーヒーが美味しく、ティーバッグも高品質でした。滞在中何度も利用しましたが、夕方のカフェ代を考えると助かりました。朝食のレベルも充分なレベル、朝イチでゆっくり食べてから外出の支度が出来るので、多少高くても朝食付きにして正解でした。ただし、タイムズスクエアのど真ん中よりは、観光に動きやすいメトロの線の近くだったり、周りにスーパーやデパートがある場所の方が、子連れで毎日外食するより、デリでの夜ご飯の買い出しには便利だったと思います。次は立地をよく検討して同じホテルを利用したいです。,Aug 8| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

Nachmittags gab es Cookies.Wir hatten einen tollen Aufenthalt im Hampton Inn und haben fuer den nächsten Trip nach NY schon wieder eine Reservierung in diesem Hotel.,Aug 4| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

Posizione fantastica a due passi da diverse linee di metro (anche quella diretta verso l'aeroporto JFK) e a 4 passi da Times Square| davvero fantastica!La colazione inclusa è un plus non da poco per un albergo a New York| visti i costi che fanno pagare gli altri alberghi (dai 20$ ai 35$ a persona al giorno!). Per la colazione erano disponibili sia i waffle| sia alcuni dolci| sia omelette e bacon (alternate con omelette alle verdure e salsiccette o piccoli hamburger). Non mancano caffè (americano)|the e succhi.A disposizione dei clienti veniva gentilmente offerto un lunch box ogni giorno con una bottiglietta d'acqua| snack e muffin alla banana. È anche possibile chiedere delle bottigliette di acqua alla reception per affrontare la giornata in giro per New York.Sempre a disposizione dei clienti| 24h su 24h| acqua fredda|  caffe e the.L'albergo è dotato di WiFi che funziona perfettamente in ogni punto dell'hotel e nella propria stanza.Per il mio soggiorno ho chiesto che mi venisse data una stanza ai piani alti con una bella vista sulla città e sono ststo accontentato con una stanza al 21esimo piano con vista a sud di Manhattan| davvero bellissima!L'unica piccola pecca è che la stanza non era molto grande e aveva una piccola cabina armadio.Alla fine del nostro soggiorno abbiamo chiesto di poter lasciare le nostre valigie per alcune ore in hotel| senza alcun problema.Al check-in abbiamo dovuto lasciare una carta di credito con una pre-autorizzazione come deposito.,May 3| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036
J'ai aimé la proximité du métro| être dans Times Square| l'accueil| la chambre et une très bonne literie. Egalement| pouvoir se servir à boire 24h/24 à la réception.

Per la colazione erano disponibili sia i waffle| sia alcuni dolci| sia omelette e bacon (alternate con omelette alle verdure e salsiccette o piccoli hamburger). Non mancano caffè (americano)|the e succhi.A disposizione dei clienti veniva gentilmente offerto un lunch box ogni giorno con una bottiglietta d'acqua| snack e muffin alla banana. È anche possibile chiedere delle bottigliette di acqua alla reception per affrontare la giornata in giro per New York.Sempre a disposizione dei clienti| 24h su 24h| acqua fredda|  caffe e the.L'albergo è dotato di WiFi che funziona perfettamente in ogni punto dell'hotel e nella propria stanza.Per il mio soggiorno ho chiesto che mi venisse data una stanza ai piani alti con una bella vista sulla città e sono ststo accontentato con una stanza al 21esimo piano con vista a sud di Manhattan| davvero bellissima!L'unica piccola pecca è che la stanza non era molto grande e aveva una piccola cabina armadio.Alla fine del nostro soggiorno abbiamo chiesto di poter lasciare le nostre valigie per alcune ore in hotel| senza alcun problema.Al check-in abbiamo dovuto lasciare una carta di credito con una pre-autorizzazione come deposito.,May 3| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036
J'ai aimé la proximité du métro| être dans Times Square| l'accueil| la chambre et une très bonne literie. Egalement| pouvoir se servir à boire 24h/24 à la réception. Un peu moins apprécié| le manque de place pour le déjeuner et l'aspect tres répétitif des aliments. Pas de vrai pain et pas de croissant ou pain au chocolat. Néanmoins| on a de quoi manger en suffisance.,May 3| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

Cet hôtel| situé en plein centre de Times Square| est dans une rue calme par rapport au quartier très animé et folklorique.A taille humaine| 31 étages| 300 chambres et 3 ascenseurs.Nous avons été surpris par l'accessibilité à la chambre| peut-être avons nous eu de la chance aux vues des différents avis| mais nous n'avons jamais eu d'attente.La chambre est grande| confortable| très bonne literie| mais ne vous attendez pas à trouver un mobilier moderne. Il manquait à notre avis une petite table-bureau. Ne vous attendez pas non plus à profiter d'une vue vue exceptionnelle| Vue sur cour d'un côté ou sur un fast food de l'autre.Le personnel est présent en nombre| il y a même une personne qui s'occupe des réservations de toutes sortes d'activités et il s'est même occupé de la réservation de notre navette de retour à l'aéroport.Nous avons apprécié l'accès gratuit et illimité 24/24 au café| thé| eau (On pouvait remplir notre bouteille d'eau pour la nuit ou la journée). Il est est proposé gratuitement de prendre un "bag' le matin contenant une bouteille d'eau| un gâteau et une barre de céréale et à partir de l'après-midi il y a à disposition différents cookies.Nous avons la possibilité d'utiliser des ordinateurs reliés à une imprimante et bien évidemment le wifi qui fonctionne parfaitement bien.Le petit déjeuné est copieux| sucré-salé| toujours approvisionné. Certes la salle est petite| souvent remplie| mais le mouvement fait qu'on trouve une place rapidement.,May 13| 2019,5,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

Hotel muito bom| staff super simpático e prestativo| bem localizado a poucos minutos a pé da Times Square. Muito limpo com aparência de renovado. Cortinas com controle remoto e controle de temperatura do quarto bem preciso. Ótimo custo benefício. Café da manhã cortesia e chás| cafés disponíveis o dia todo no lobby. Água em garrafinhas cortesia. Eventualmente serviam cookies deliciosos na recepção e também havia um lanchinho  disponível numa sacola de papel para levar aos passeieos. Só dois pontos negativos que atrapalharam um pouco: elevadores muito congestionados| apenas 3 para uns 30 andares com muitos quartos. Às vezes era necessário esperar muito para subir ou descer. E as camas do quarto para 4 pessoas eram muito pequenas duas camas de casal estreitas| o que ficava apertado pra dois adultos. Mas mesmo assim voltaria a ficar no hotel com certeza pois tem muitos pontos positivos.,Mar 1| 2019,4,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036

Hotellet har ett fantastiskt läge på 41:st and 7:th. Det finns gott om restauranger i närheten| Mc Donald’s ligger mitt emot och Ruby Tuesday 100 meter bort. Det är sju gator till Times Square.

Tolles Hotel| das wir jederzeit wieder buchen würden.Das Personal war stets gut gelaunt| sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit.Das Hotel ist recht neu und verfügt über vernünftige Fenster| die den Straßenlärm (völlig normal in dieser zentralen Lage) wirksam abhalten. Das Zimmer war| obwohl wir zu viert darin gewohnt haben| vollkommen ausreichend| schön eingerichtet und sauber. Die Betten fanden wir sehr bequem. Das Frühstücksbuffet war sicherlich nicht zu vergleichen mit dem| was wir in Deutschland gewohnt sind| dennoch war es umfangreicher als wir erwartet hatten. In der Lobby gab es zu jeder Zeit kostenlos Kaffee/Tee/Kakao und Wasser - sehr angenehm!Die Lage ist perfekt für alle| die viel zu Fuß in Manhattan unterwegs sein wollen. Besonders praktisch: In nur 3 Minuten erreicht man zu Fuß eine Metro| die einen ohne Umsteigen direkt zum JFK-Flughafen bringt.,Nov 4| 2018,4,Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central,220 West 41st St.| New York| NY| 10036
