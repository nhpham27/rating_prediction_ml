Great stay would love to come back,Aug 11| 2021,5,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201
Very clean and quiet. Comfortable. All staff polite and helpful. Would definitely stay there again!,Aug 8| 2021,5,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201

The rooms were nice and spacious.  The bathroom was spacious.  The hotel is near many eateries| so you can walk to nearby delis.  24 hour valet!  You want to go| you can leave in 10 minutes!  Front desk was excellent and housekeeping was very attentive to our schedules.,Aug 2| 2021,5,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201
Everything was great| service| location| cleanliness. Only problem was a constant sound of the vent in the bathroom. After a while we got used to it but I wouldn't stay in the deluxe king again but definitely come back to the hotel. We loved it!,Aug 2| 2021,5,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201
The hotel does not meet the level of expectation for the $279/nt rate. The customer service is lackluster. More importantly there is a mandatory $25 fee that forces you to drink at the bar or buy something from their “gift shop”. Parking options are either very costly and extremely costly. Good shopping in the area.,Aug 1| 2021,3,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201

The hotel and staff were great. The corner room was beautiful. What killed me was the air-conditioning...or rather the lack of it. Our room was soupy despite adjusting it to the lowest temp| highest fan.,Jul 26| 2021,3,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201
(1) Lacking adequate lighting in room; (2) lacking 24 hour access to complimentary coffee| decaf and hot water with lighteners| stirrers| etc. in the lobby;(3) lacking bellboy service;(4) lacking comfortable seating;(5) no longer offering buffet breakfast;(6) hallways looked worn and dingy.At the end of one of the days of our stay we returned in the evening and the room had not been refreshed nor attended to!We felt that overall the hotel had lost much of its former charm and amenities.    :^(,Jul 26| 2021,3,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201

The gentleman who checked me in was awful.  But the lady who checked me out was wonderful.  The restaurant was wonderful as well.,Jul 22| 2021,3,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201

I think you are lucky to have the staff that you have!  Everyone is being asked to work harder- with fewer staff members.  I HOPE you are paying them well!  From housekeeping to waiters to front desk-they ALL were giving it that extra effort!,Jul 19| 2021,4,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201
Room very clean. Building seems new or renovated. Great location.,Jul 19| 2021,5,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201
Although we typically enjoy our stays at Hilton hotels| we were disappointed. Our room’s AC did not work and during peak summer heat and humidity| it made for an uncomfortable stay. The lobby and hallway felt great but as we walked into our room| it felt swampy and warm. We had a quick stay otherwise we would have asked do move rooms. I don’t like when there isn’t a vent in the bathroom to filter some of the humidity that builds up during showers. All of that wet air just sits in the room. I will say that the staff were helpful though. Parking is a bit of a pain| but that is typical for NYC.,Jul 16| 2021,3,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201

We had a nice stay. Check in was extremely smooth and very comfortable beds. The only downside was that we were charged a mandatory $25 fee   tax after the fact. I guess it's on their site| but we booked through Orbitz so we didn't know about it.,Jun 22| 2021,4,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201

Resort fees? In Brooklyn? That expire daily!! Please!! This is just a bait and switch. I was quoted one price| then slammed with a resort fee. I will never stay at another Hilton. Couldn't use the bar as a bar| and I had already made plans before I realized I would be hit with this fee. So that money is gone. (Let us be clear| the staff and location are great.) But resort fees should be outlawed| or incorporated in the price when I look to compare prices!!!,Apr 22| 2021,3,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201
Cleanliness and responsive staff were highlights as well as the best Manhattan’s mixed at the bar!,Apr 20| 2021,5,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201
Breakfast included means certain select items on the menu is complimentary| but they don't tell you that before you order. Have to take the food to go - nowhere to sit and eat. Had to spend 30 mins going back and forth between the bar and reception because our room number wasn't on the list. I've been to way better Hilton's.

The rooms were so dirty and gross. Are room smelled of smoke and had cigarette burns in the carpet and chairs. One of the chairs in the room had large smelly stain on it. The whole floor smelled of cigar and cigarette smoke| even though it was a non smoking hotel. We changed rooms and there were black hairs all over the linens a pillows| the sheets were stained.

Two issues were present with this hotel. First| the rampent drug use was an issue and caused us to need to change rooms through our stay into what felt like a downgraded smaller room. Second| an "urban destination" charge was added to my stay and not clarified to me until checkout. The more frustrating part of this experience is that I was told at checkout that I could have applied this $25 a day fee towards food at the hotel. The employee told me that I should have been notified of this at check-in| however| I was not notified of this. Had I known that I would have eaten at the hotel and saved myself on takeout costs.

Here's why I gave a poor rating.  Hilton| like many hotels| is now using phoney charges on top of the quoted rates.  On this stay| Hilton created a "Urban Destination Charge" of $25.00 per day. With taxes| this comes to $28.69 per day. These charges are theft| they aren't quoted in the daily rate and are only disclosed when you check in.

So glad we chose this hotel| it was perfect! Close to shops| train (and easy transfer to New York| 7 stops to mid town). Manhattan was crazy busy and so nice to come back to Brooklyn. Close and uber to Williamsburg to visit| a must. Gospel church (amazing experience) on the next block. Rooms were good size. Really loved our time here.,Jan 8| 2020,5,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201
the only problem was the TV reception for CBS for the Patriots-Titans game.  It was very blurry.  All the other channels were fine but CBS.  So we went downstairs to the bar and there the picture was clear but no sound.  The policy is not to have sound in the bar. Really? Tough to watch a playoff game without sound.,Jan 6| 2020,4,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201
Hilton is trying to screw customers by adding bogus fees and supposed taxes to the final bill. They created an “Urban Fee” of $25.00 per night and two minor taxes for about $5.00 more each night. I was told they were to be removed when I complained at checkin| but they were there at checkout. There’s a reason they let people just leave the hotel these days| so they can rip you off. Always check out and ask for the final statement! The hotel also charges $300 for incidentals and takes three days after checkout  to issue a credit so they have had my cash for over a week before they return it. My room was not clean when it was finally available. The property is nice| room design and bathrooms are nice| location is good. If they weren’t rip-off artists| I would return| it  but Hilton’s added fees and dishonesty is something I can’t accept.

My main complaint is the $25/day "facility fee" (or whatever they call it) which they only tell you about until you check in.  So...be aware of that before you book.

Considering I was sitting 15 feet away from her| in clear sight| she could have waved| or something. The room was clean| and comfortable.  The hotel itself is dated| and uninspiring.  At breakfast the next day| my phone rang at 10| telling me to vacate the room. I thought maybe I would get an extra hour to check it|  since check in was not so great.  But that did not happen. Oh| the bartender also sucked.  I stay here because I booked late| nad not much else was available. I know why this was available last minute and  all the other hotels were booked. Not worth the $350.  Don’t do it!,Dec 12| 2019,3,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201

Love the beds at the Hilton. But there was a lot of banging. I think it was the cabinets in the room where they keep the fridge. Fridge doors banging off the cabinet doors. I suggest taking the cabinet doors off.,Dec 7| 2019,4,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201
I was here overnight on a business trip in early December.  The hotel was very nice| the bed was comfortable| and the room was spacious and clean.  The buffet breakfast in the morning was very good and was included as a $25 free credit provided at check-in to the hotel's bar and restuarant.  One complaint of mine is that concierge did not let me know that my parking voucher from the affiliated self-park garage had to be validated before my departure.  The garage refused to honor the $30 flat rate for overnight parking even after presentation of a hotel receipt.  The arrogant employee said I had to return to the hotel to get my ticket stamped even through I provided clear evidence of my stay.  Needless to say| nobody has the time or patience to be walking up and down NYC blocks on a weekday winter morning to dispute parking charges.  Hilton needs to be clear with their guests about how their parking arrangements work or they should become affiliated with the parking establishment in closest proximity to the hotel.,Dec 4| 2019,4,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201

Pretty standard hotel experience| the room was huge| lobby area was nice| elevators were very fast. Unfortunately| my time at this hotel was tainted by the very aggressive housekeeping staff (well| one woman in particular). She knocked on the door at 9am to asked when we would be leaving. I told her 11am (check out time). My friend left the room at 10:30am to catch a flight but I stayed behind|,Sep 4| 2019,4,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201

I felt that room service should start earlier| so I had breakfast downstairs which I got a cup of coffee| a cup of scrambled eggs and some bacon|  it was $27.22 plus tip.  more than double room service and the guy followed me around like I was a criminal.  Had I know that it was going to cost me 30.00 for a little bit of egg and bacon I wouldn't have gotten it.  It wasn't worth it.

The location was great for where i had to go. Nice bar area. Service in the restaurant at dinner was pleasant enough| but reallllly slowwww.

The hotel was fine| in line with other Hilton's. A perfectly fine business travel hotel. However| when traveling for work| the one thing you need is internet access.  The hotel offers free internet| but that free internet is sporadic at best. I mentioned it to the front desk and they offered no accommodation. I know I can pay an additional $15 per day to get what I suppose is more reliable internet| but when you are already paying several hundred dollars a night for a room| the free internet should at the very least work. It might be slower| but it should work. This did not. I wasted a half hour in the morning before a meeting trying to get connected| I only had one hour to prepare| with a similar issue the following days. I was there for three nights and wished I had stayed elsewhere so I would have been able to get some work done. I ended up using my phone as a hotspot| but the hotel also only had 1 bar or cellular signal so| the hotspot was very very slow.  For this reason alone| I would not stay here while traveling for business.,Mar 28| 2019,4,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201

I was so disappointed by our stay. Had reserved a room with king sized bed. And had called the hotel to tell them we’d be late. When we checked they said there were no more rooms with king sized beds. Our TV didnt work so someone had to come up several times to fix it. Sheets were dirty. I was so disappointed and it was a birthday weekend getaway.,Nov 9| 2018,1,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201

Overall I had a pleasant stay at this hotel| it doesn't offer the warm cookie on check in though!!! The room was spacious & housekeeping was excellent. It's approx 5-7 mins walk to the nearest subway station| Dominoes pizza| bakery & Baskin Robbins etc... Generally| the reception staff were nice| quite formal which is okay| but lacked the personable touch. However| one exception in the shape of Masood who was attending at breakfast was a really nice guy| he was very helpful & explained the use of the lounge. The girl who checked me in failed to mention the complimentary drinks & snacks in the lounge or drinks from the reception area. Also| despite there being 4 guests in my room| housekeeping kept leaving 2 towels!!! Front desk were happy to bring extra up. No shuttle bus service available| no bathrobes| misplaced towel rail in bathroom| no long closet to hang dresses| overall though this is a clean| conveniently situated hotel.,Sep 13| 2018,4,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201

We were there for our 45th anniversary.  From the doorman to the front desk to room service waiter to housekeeping. All very nice.Our room was very comfortable| and spotless.  Lots of places to eat.... I would not recommend room service.  A simple grilled cheese with meat. Very little meat in the center of the sandwich with an inch of bread all around. And I don't know where the cheese was because it wasn't in my sandwich.Not far from the subway. Felt like a pretty safe place in day and early evening. We weren't out late.

one of the best places in brooklyn.  enjoyed the proximity to bars| restaurants| and subway stations.  will recommend definitely.,Feb 26| 2018,5,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201
The king suite had exceptionally generous space and was perfect for a family with the separate bedroom. Only complaint is that. considering this is a brand new Hilton| the quality of the lighting in the room was poor and the walls were surprisingly bare. Overall would come back primarily for the space and comfortable bedroom. Staff were very helpful.,Feb 21| 2018,4,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201
Apparently| the hotel deal involved assigning what some might view as less desirable rooms| in this case a handicapped access room.  After we adjusted to the idiosyncrasies| we decided it was worth it to have the extra space.  Staff were great and the location was perfect.  Would stay in Downtown Brooklyn again and be happy to return to the Hilton.

one of the best places in brooklyn.  enjoyed the proximity to bars| restaurants| and subway stations.  will recommend definitely.,Feb 26| 2018,5,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201
The king suite had exceptionally generous space and was perfect for a family with the separate bedroom. Only complaint is that. considering this is a brand new Hilton| the quality of the lighting in the room was poor and the walls were surprisingly bare. Overall would come back primarily for the space and comfortable bedroom. Staff were very helpful.,Feb 21| 2018,4,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201
Apparently| the hotel deal involved assigning what some might view as less desirable rooms| in this case a handicapped access room.  After we adjusted to the idiosyncrasies| we decided it was worth it to have the extra space.  Staff were great and the location was perfect.  Would stay in Downtown Brooklyn again and be happy to return to the Hilton.  Just  wish Hotels.com made it clear that we would have a handicapped access room.,Feb 20| 2018,5,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201

This hotel is beautiful| we were treated so nicely by everyone who worked there. Love the Peter Thomas Roth toiletries too! We booked this hotel because we had tickets to see the Nets play at Barclays Stadium which was a 20 min walk. We were also able to walk to all the bars and restaurants on Smith Street which is right around the corner from the hotel| perfect! They even have valet parking so we never had to deal with our car until we checked out and then they had it waiting out front for us! Definitely highly recommend this Hilton!,Dec 24| 2017,5,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201

Took forever to check in because they didn't know if the room was ready or not even though we checked in after 9pm. Also I asked for my valet car ready by 11:45 am and when I got down at 11:50| they forgot about it and got my car at 12:05 pm and was late for my meeting. The phone for the hotel wasn't working and Internet didn't work. I know the spectrum phone line was cut off so this wasn't hiltons fault but it was quite difficult to function without the Internet service. I called the Hilton corporate line because the hotel phone wasn't working to let them know about my late check in| the rep on the phone was not very nice and sounded like he didn't want to be there at work. Overall horrible experience from beginning to end. I travel a lot and always have been using Hilton property but this was definitely one of the worst experiences.,Nov 26| 2017,3,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201

We stayed at The Hilton Brooklyn with my son for my friend's wedding. Our room was clean and had great views with three large windows. Although the website said that it had a microwave and chair/sofa by the window| which it did not. It only had a desk chair. My friend had a suite that was less great. The TV would not connect to the WiFi| it did not have a long mirror (only the one in the bathroom over the sink)| and we had to call multiple times to get extra chairs in the room. The executive lounge and breakfast was great! However|the restaurant and room service is lacking when it comes to food for children.

The hotel is excellent. Great room| clean and spacious. However we ordered a grilled cheese for our kid and we were charged $35. No joke| and it wasn't even good| he wouldn't eat it. So I recommend the hotel but not the food.,Apr 29| 2017,5,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201

It's only been open 3-4 months. Sasha (I forget the names of the other front desk staff) were phenomenal. Felix| engineering and all around fix it guy| also excellent| friendly| great attitude| made us feel like royalty. The room/bathroom size was adequate but the bed| a bit on the firm side for me| the pillows| way too soft| housekeeping did an amazing job to keep it super clean and stocked with towels and toiletries. We traveled to NY to unfortunately bury my mother and put up her headstone etc. and the evening before checkout I asked a gentleman at the front desk for a late checkout on a Monday and he had authority to extend from 12:00 to 1:00 and added that we'd need to discuss with the on duty manager who gets in at 9:00am. When I asked what it might cost to extend it from 1:00 to around 6:00 (our flight home wasn't leaving till after 10:00pm and we were exhausted from the many trials and tribulations it took for the funeral etc| to which he expressed his condolences and said he wasn't sure but perhaps $75.00 to maybe half day room rate). We called the next morning and the manager was not only not compassionate to our plight but very straight forward and said to extend the 4 hours would be a full days rate| didn't express anything for my loss and my wife explained what front desk told us the night before| he didn't care and said that info was wrong and that housekeeping leaves at 4:00pm. Heartless in my opinion|could be cleaned Monday. We won't be using Hilton again.,Mar 28| 2017,5,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201

Was good except the dining room does not serve any food after 9:30 am for breakfast during the week.  We had to go elsewhere.  The front desk does not provide cash.  In an unfamiliar place this is very uncomfortable for elderly women.  We were pointed out to nearest ATM.,Mar 27| 2017,4,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201
2nd Stay at this hotel.  1st was perfect.  2nd time there was a problem with the fridge.  It had not been cleaned and the previous guest's food remained.  Told the front desk.  Left the room.  When I returned| the fridge had still not been cleaned.  Staff cleaned on second request.  Otherwise everything was good.  Would have appreciated being comped something| but the hotel didn't offer anything.,Mar 27| 2017,4,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201
Overall my stay was great the only thing is when my husband and I ordered room service the food was cold.,Mar 24| 2017,5,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201
The area is developing so you have several of the high street shops. Very close to Brooklyn Tabernacle church| Barclays Centre and trains. One great aspect is hotel provides Netflix!,Mar 21| 2017,4,Hilton Brooklyn New York,140 Schermerhorn Street| Brooklyn| NY| 11201

Everything was very clean. The place looks brand new and is beautiful. The staff was very friendly and even suggested near by places to go.
