Hello i  have an hotel.  Com rewards card for traveling  and when im in New York  this is the hotel to book embassy nice  clean and near by location for food and shopping  great stay what more can i say!,Aug 16| 2021,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
Location is excellent. What I didn't like| no drinking water available in the room and at the lobby the price of drinking water was too much!,Aug 16| 2021,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
The breakfast included was amazing| our room had a good view of the city and the hallway to our room had an amazing view of the empire state building,Aug 15| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
Great location| good service.The problem was in breakfast/dining area is very very crowded.,Aug 15| 2021,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
Great location| modern hotel rooms and nice view from the city. Housekeeping new rules to save money is a mess| they go to your room randomly. This should be changed asap,Aug 14| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
We stayed for the weekend. This place is great. Nice size room for NYC| very comfortable beds| good size bathroom. Breakfast was delicious| lots of choices| but super crowded| small space. They were offering free sodas and waters in the lobby throughout our stay. Not sure if that is an every day thing. I will definitely stay here again anytime I visit NYC. Great for families| sofa bed was big and comfy for our eight year old.,Aug 12| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

We called down the 2nd day we were there to get the room cleaned| no one came. The next day| the room attendant came at 6:00pm???? We were in the room & told her to come back at 6:30. She never came back. Next day was the same thing. We stayed 4 nights & never got the room cleaned. If we complained the first day| then send someone out ASAP the next day| why wait until 6:00 pm??!! Also| another issue is way too many people at breakfast!! You can’t enjoy your food| or you have to go back to the room to eat| which the elevators take too long. Also| keep the restrooms off the front desk stocked| I had to ask for toilet paper twice. Sorry to say| not impressed with this Embassy Suites. No manager reception either| but it says it’s an amenity on your website. I was quite shocked about that. Oh well| my stay was a one and done| never again at this hotel.,Aug 9| 2021,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
Great location| excellent breakfast despite crowded conditions| nice but tiny room| curteous staff. I highly recommend it for a couple but the room wouldn’t fit a larger family.,Aug 7| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
This property is in the best position ever| everything near to you| you can walk everywhere from here| of course if you want to know better manhattan you need to walk..,Jul 31| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
Great location. Large variety at breakfast. Room set up great for my family( we had the king suite w sofa division). Outdoor sky lawn great little area.,Jul 29| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
It is ok hotel. If I knew all the info I have now probably I could choose different one.,Jul 29| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
The check-in process took almost an hour in line. The rooms were not ready. When we finally get the room after traveling all day there were no towels until the next day. Even have to go to the front desk to ask because the guest service line never answered our calls. In top of that one night the fire alarm went off waking all guests at 6am. I will never stay in that place and I don't recommend it.,Jul 28| 2021,1,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
Unfortunately| most guests did not receive towels. I happen to get two. I shared one with my son who had only one towel for four people. My brother also had one for two and my nephew had none for two! Check-in was an hour long after two hours of actual check- in time. I’ve stayed at embassy suites many many times everywhere including NY and have Never been disappointed until now. This Embassy Suite was the smallest room I’ve ever had. I believe these issues were because of COVID! No one was there to work! If all had gone normal| I would stay if only it were me in the room. Too small for two people let alone two people with two kids!,Jul 27| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
It was the worst experience I ever had with hotels. When we arrived after hours of driving| we were told that no rooms were available. However| I had already payed for 2 nights. We got sent to another hotel but it was significantly worse in quality. The room we got was nothing compared to what I had reserved. It was a lot smaller in size and it didn't even have a balcony.,Jul 26| 2021,1,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
If you want a cheap stay and not worry about the cleanliness| then this is ok.,Jul 25| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
This hotel charged me more than what I bought. They said that was a fee that they never mentioned in the price. I’m so angry with it.,Jul 24| 2021,1,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
The hotel itself was good| a minor issue in the room as the shower handle had the retainer pieces dislodged and cut my arm.Check in was by far the worst I have experienced.  Arrived at tge hotel early and check in was not available.  That is understandable.  check in time was 4:00PM.  Returned at 4:00 to find a line approximately 50 people to check in and two clercks working.  While telling people there room wasn't ready and may not be until after 8-9:00.  All the time leaving to go somewhere.  At one point all the clercks just left.  After being in line for 2 hours | and next in line.  all the clercks left again.  The manager arrived and was in confrontation with the man in front of me.  I could not believe that the manager actually told him "What do you want me to do clean your room myself?. I have other people to take care of| not just you." He obviously canceled and left. So after 21/2 HOURS i finally was able to get to my room.  I will be sending Embassy Suites an email as well.,Jul 24| 2021,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
Property was severely understaffed. One young individual was going above and beyond checking folks in. While the other co worker couldn't handle the stress of the process. They claimed lack of housekeeping support. We waited 6 hours to check in. Bathroom was filthy. The lobby bathroom had no toilet paper and the feminine hygiene receptacles hadnt been changed in a while. Rooms were untouched the 3 days we were there.,Jul 23| 2021,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. I’m a New Yorker| so I was prepared for a small room with mediocre cleanliness… but this hotel is a midtown gem! Modern| clean| and spacious.

Nice hotel. Not bad Location. Walking distance to time square and Bryant park. We were unable to hangout in the lounge. And you can hear your neighbors they the vents in the bathroom and room. Kinda awkward! Lol! The TV kept glitching. The window only opened a few inches lol! And no fan. A/C was very cold. Food in the area kinda sucked. Taco Bell| dunkN donuts next door| and few others. For the city that never sleeps I wasn’t able to order food after 930p for delivery which sucked too. Which the restaurant was open downstairs. Breakfast in the AM wasn’t bad.

worst hotel experience.. issue with cleanliness . Sofa bed was damaged due to which one person couldn’t sleep all night even when we made reservation for 3 . We specially paid extra amount for late check out on Expedia while reservation but hotel staff did not have any information on it . Expedia charged me full amount for reservation and than hotel also charged my credit card- still trying to sort it out .. not expect this with hotel chain like Hilton..,Jun 19| 2021,1,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
My family and I stayed here for 3 days on the weekend. The only reason I booked this room was for the balcony and location. I would like to start off by saying the staff are very nice and professional. The main issue was the the room not being clean. It looked like they haven’t mopped the floor in months. We had to ask for them to bring someone to mop up the dust and dead flowers under the sofa bed. The balcony room was very small but it’s NY so I expected that. You have to let them know the night before if you require housekeeping the next day. Ask staff for extra towels and blankets if you need them. A false fire alarm woke up us up on Saturday morning at 8am and went on for about 15 minutes. There was always a long line in the lobby to get on the elevators to the rooms. The only plus was the balcony room| nice staff| and the $15 room credit for snacks daily. I do not think I would consider staying here again since cleanliness is sort of a big deal to us.,Jun 19| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

The only thing I like was the location| close to everything. I didn't like that the room reserved was not given| I reserved a city view and they gave me an alley with people working next| so I couldn't even open the curtains. Check in was so delayed that they check me in at 6pm with more than 12 guests in the same situation. The bedding for the sofa bed was not there and needed to ask 2 times. The internet was not working for the first 3 days. Trash collection didn't happened and we were there a week. They didn't offer to review the price even they didn't have us the room we reserved. I honestly think they were not ready to receive the influx of tourists back in NYC.,Jun 10| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
Conveniently located very close to Bryant Park| Macys and Time Square. Plenty of shopping and places to dine close by.

Noisy and frustrating are the two words that come to mind when I think about my stay at the Embassy Suites Times Square. First of all| the hotel itself is skinny which means most rooms are in earshot of the elevators. The elevators have a super loud "bing" and you can hear it throughout the night. The other guest also come off the elevator talking loud and slamming doors and you can hear it all. The walls are thin too| I heard my neighbor watching TV and laughing at 4am. The other thing is that Hilton seems to have installed a sensor at many of their properties that the air conditioning shuts off after some time. That means you wake up with a stuffy room when the air shuts off - there is no option to leave the fan on. I do not recommend this property.,Jun 1| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

The room provided had a great view of the Empire State Building| and lower Manhattan skyline in the distance. The room was mostly clean; the fridge smelled bad and there were random hairs in different parts of the bathroom. One towel was dirty. Staff was great! Front desk was overloaded and had a long line a few times. Free breakfast was nice and met our not-so-high expectations. Location was great for what we needed too. Overall pleasant experience; would stay again if the price is right,May 31| 2021,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

I didn't like that the room reserved was not given| I reserved a city view and they gave me an alley with people working next| so I couldn't even open the curtains. Check in was so delayed that they check me in at 6pm with more than 12 guests in the same situation. The bedding for the sofa bed was not there and needed to ask 2 times. The internet was not working for the first 3 days. Trash collection didn't happened and we were there a week. They didn't offer to review the price even they didn't have us the room we reserved. I honestly think they were not ready to receive the influx of tourists back in NYC.,Jun 10| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
Conveniently located very close to Bryant Park| Macys and Time Square. Plenty of shopping and places to dine close by. Hotel has a very nice buffet style breakfast which will save you a lot of money| would definitely stay again.,Jun 9| 2021,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

Noisy and frustrating are the two words that come to mind when I think about my stay at the Embassy Suites Times Square. First of all| the hotel itself is skinny which means most rooms are in earshot of the elevators. The elevators have a super loud "bing" and you can hear it throughout the night. The other guest also come off the elevator talking loud and slamming doors and you can hear it all. The walls are thin too| I heard my neighbor watching TV and laughing at 4am. The other thing is that Hilton seems to have installed a sensor at many of their properties that the air conditioning shuts off after some time. That means you wake up with a stuffy room when the air shuts off - there is no option to leave the fan on. I do not recommend this property.,Jun 1| 2021,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
First time in NYC. Hotel was very accommodating. Great location. Our room was comfortable. Will stay again.,Jun 1| 2021,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

The room provided had a great view of the Empire State Building| and lower Manhattan skyline in the distance. The room was mostly clean; the fridge smelled bad and there were random hairs in different parts of the bathroom. One towel was dirty. Staff was great! Front desk was overloaded and had a long line a few times. Free breakfast was nice and met our not-so-high expectations. Location was great for what we needed too. Overall pleasant experience; would stay again if the price is right,May 31| 2021,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

I love the embassy but nothing about this property jumps out as outstanding except for elevator security meaning you have to use your room key to go up.Of al the embassy’s around the United States| this one is not serving hot breakfast. Any other state offers to go style but not here. Be prepared for your days inn style continental breakfast. For the amount of money for two days I think it’s really sad. COVID is no longer an excuse to not cook! I’ve been to Atlanta and Virginia and both of them have hot breakfast.

They need to get better parking arrangements for guest.,Oct 3| 2020,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

We traveled to New York around the rise of Covid-19. We always stay at the Embassy for complimentary happy hour and breakfast. We didn’t get any of that and were not notified of this upon booking our stay. It would have been great to know this otherwise we could have just stayed at another hotel.,Mar 16| 2020,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

Our February vacation was awesome in NYC; we enjoy this property so much| we decided to stay one more day!! The check-in was quick| very professional and informative. Room-service was prompt and professional! (the sweet-chili wings are out of this world!!) Our room was spacious| clean| very comfortable| excellent view of the Empire State Building and West 37th street! Breakfast is EXCELLENT| they have a cooked to order station available for omelettes| eggs-your way!! There are 4-5 hot items available| differ from day to day. Oatmeal is a favorite of mine! There is cut-fresh fruit and yogurt available. Choice of juices| coffee and tea available. FYI! The later in the breakfast shift you go: the more crowded the breakfast room become!! A little overwhelming! Also| the elevators for a 39 floor hotel property (YUP-39) get pretty congested and slowed down| during heavy breakfast goer traffic! We took the stairs| since we went to breakfast toward the end of breakfast time.  But when we had gone early| the elevators were smooth sailing!! This hotel is an awesome property| excellent location; literally 12 minute walk to Times Square| Central Park was a 10 minute ride + 8 minute walk to Central Park and Zoo. I recommend this hotel 150%| as a guest service supervisor of a hotel in downtown Back Bay Boston| Massachusetts and hotel/restaurant management degree; I can assure you this property is worth it! You will not be disappointed! Take my word. 👌💯 🏨,Feb 29| 2020,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

Stayed just after NYE 2020. We had to book two rooms since we were a family of 5. This hotel is not like other Embassy Suites - the rooms are NYC sized - which means small. And it was not a real suite| but the back of the sofa bed made a pseudo internal wall-like barrier but not private by any means. They did not have a 5 person room available for us - so we had to pay essentially double to stay. Lots of hallway to get to sleeping space - and interior doors between room opened to block the hallway so that was basically non-functional. Windows actually opened about 4 inches - which was nice. Rooms were quiet. Bathrooms were surprisingly ok - big enough with good water pressure in the shower. No tub. Clean. Fridge was extra small with no freezer and microwave put the micro in wave - it too was small. But it's NYC so it was probably bigger than lots of apartments. Breakfast was good - although at odd times the line was long and there was way too little room to sit and eat - many people took the food up to their rooms because of this. The manager's reception was ok - snacks varied from pita| pretzels| caprese| chips and salsa - and simple beer and wine. We sat with other people and made for interesting conversations! As for our view| in one room we could see the Empire State Building - the other we could not. Parking was two streets away and $73 a night for our SUV - so just know that too. Midtown is great to walk to ESB| Rockefeller| Library| Grand Central.

Please stay away from his hotel. We were in JFK Airport just landed when we came to know hotel has cancelled the reservation and no one even informed us until after the hotel said they could not accomodate us. The reason given was maintenance issues but I am guessing they had someone ready to pay more for this and just left us without a hotel in the middle of the night at NewYork.,Dec 31| 2019,1,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

Rooms are micro size.  We had one drawer and no closet.  Chair folds out for bed for 3rd person was like a torture device.  Hotel was very clean and staff was excellent| big call out for Tom in the heist bar.  Excellent service.  Location was good.

Absolutely did not like the tiny bathroom| absolutely did not like to have to wait for seating for breakfast and evening reception|  didn't like that room had not been cleaned by 5pm.

This hotel location is great.  Just a few blocks from Bryant park and close enough to Time Square| but away from the excessive noise of that area.  You can walk to Rockefeler center and central park as well as the Empire State Blog| The Vessel| and Chelsea area. With respect to the rooms| I found them of good size for NYC standards| with all amenities needed| including coffee machine| microwave| etc.  Breakfast is included and is good compared to other similar hotels. My only recommendation is| if you do not mind the views| take a low floor because the elevators may get crowded at certain hours and the hotel has 39 floors.  I was on the 6th floor and could use the stairs to the 4th {breakfast} and to the 2nd {gym} without waiting.  In general| I highly recommend this hotel because of location and nice features.,Nov 12| 2019,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
Overall it was a very good stay. We had a room with a balcony and our view was the Empire State Building!! Amazing.  My only feedback for improvement would be to have housekeeping be a  bit more detailed in the cleaning.  Overall everything was clean| just small things like the plastic cups were not replaced when used not dusted every day.  But the room was clean| just could have payed more attention to detail.  Worth the money and I would stay there again.,Nov 11| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

Free breakfast was nice but crowded eating areas and couldn’t ever find a place to sit- we tried to go early so it was the “less crowded time” as posted. The 3rd floor sky lawn as advertised was disappointing. We tried to bring our own food and they kicked us out.

Location is great and they have an awesome happy hour. But housekeeping doesn’t come until late in the day so that was annoying. We’d come back to the room around 2:30/3 0’clock and it still hadn’t been touched by housekeeping.,Sep 8| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

An amazing hotel! We booked a room with a view and it was gorgeous.. from seeing the sunset glow in the high rise buildings to watching them all start to twinkly as darkness fell. Staff were lovely. Tea and coffee facilities and hairdryer in room. Cool water and ice where you can fill your drink bottles up. Breakfast pretty much the same each day.. sausage bacon| scrambled eggs| waffles| maple syrup| fruit| yoghurt| cereals| juices and an egg station where you have your omelette or fried eggs cooked freshly for you. I didn’t really believe previous views that there would be a free bar.. but sure enough between 17.30 and 19.30 any drinks are free.. wine| beers| mixers and spirits and cocktails and snacks.. cheese and biscuits| doughnut balls| tortilla chips and dips etc. Our room was spacious had a decent tv and shower room. Location is perfect as very central Manhattan. Close to Times Square| 5th Avenue and Empire State Building and much more all in walking distance.,Sep 5| 2019,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

Free breakfast was nice but crowded eating areas and couldn’t ever find a place to sit- we tried to go early so it was the “less crowded time” as posted. The 3rd floor sky lawn as advertised was disappointing. We tried to bring our own food and they kicked us out.

This was an excellent  hotel. Updated| clean and quiet. It could use another elevator bank| as the wait for the elevators could be long at times. Otherwise it was outstanding.

Breakfast was chaos! Small room| crowded| often ran out of food. Hotel room was super tiny| unable to lock bathroom| room was sometimes warm.

While the hotel was clean the entire setup does not work. We were constantly waiting for elevators and the complimentary breakfast was a disaster. They do not provide enough seating for the amount of people coming down. Even though we followed their recommendation going down during light traffic time| there still was no place to sit. Staying here was more like work than relaxing.,Aug 13| 2019,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

Check in was 4pm and room was not ready| not just for me but for many frustrated guests waiting for their room.  People had dinner reservations| theater tickets| concert tickets and were waiting.  Front desk seemed quite used to this.  If you plan on using the sleeper sofa think twice unless it's for a 10 year old.  It's nothing more than a pull out chair| not even as wide as a twin bed.  Next day we were out of the room all day.  Came back exhausted to find the room had never been cleaned and there were no clean towels.  Called to the front desk and they brought up two towels.  Ended up finding a cart in a hallway and took the towels we needed for the 3 of us.  Clearly this hotel has a problem with inefficient housekeeping that they can't get the rooms ready for check in and don't clean rooms for guests staying more than one night.  The bed was very comfortable.,Aug 3| 2019,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

It was an okay hotel. Location was good. Breakfast was good| albeit busy. Room is small for three people. They could do a better job with efficiency. Put a fan in bathroom| put a light over mirror in “hall.” These 2 things would help 3 people get ready at the same time. Provide a wall makeup mirror. Not super clean. Found items left by previous guests and long hair on a number of things. No blanket left for pullout| big deal at 1am when you just arrive. Not good at leaving things like extra toilet paper. They could do a lot of simple things to make it better. Toilet top seat kept popping off which was annoying. Sinks were neat| but installations were crooked so it almost defeats the coolness of it. How it is| it’s mediocre at best. We’d try elsewhere next time. Staff was nice though and again| the included breakfast was a godsend.

The location is very convenient. Only a 5 minute  walk to Broadway for entertainment or 5th Av for shopping. The room we had seemed small and the layout very strange. A small dwarf wall divides the room into a tiny sleeping area and tiny lounge area giving a clostraphobic feeling to both area.  Get rid of the stupid dividing wall and it would be comfortable place to stay!  View out of the window on the 9th floor was none existant. Just a bunch of offices and workers within a very short distance. You sould get eye contact with them. The included breakfast is good with many choices offered. A common complaint is that the elevators are slow but we did not experience that problem. Staff at the front desk are very helpfull and friendly. Overall| though clean and tidy the hotel feels cramped and not up to the usual Hilton brand expectations and standards but you still pay the Hilton price.,Jun 14| 2019,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

Overall| though clean and tidy the hotel feels cramped and not up to the usual Hilton brand expectations and standards but you still pay the Hilton price.,Jun 14| 2019,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

The hotel provides solid value and it quite serviceable for a short stay| but the room layout was a bit of a challenge. The sole closet was located in the bathroom. The bathroom had a sliding door with no lock. And there was very little desk space| making it a bit more challenging to work. Overall| it is a high quality stay| given price relative to others in the area| with some minor challenges.,May 15| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
Very nice location| reasonably priced and overall very nice stay.  The service help at both breakfast and the evening reception were all outstanding; very friendly| efficient and professional.  They all should be commended!  Overall We enjoyed the hotel and would recommend it.On the not so good side| there are too few elevators which resulted in long waits at times.  FOX “news” was on 24/7 in the lobby which I found to be totally inappropriate| especially in NYC. There was confusion regarding the parking. My voucher was stamped and told I would pay at the garage. I was at IPark and I later found out the parking fee was to be charged to my room.  It was all worked out in the end.  Finally| the garage employee took over 1/2 hour to find my car!,May 14| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

It's a pretty nice hotel| but they have 3 very slow elevators to service a 35 floor hotel.  We were luckily on the 6th floor so we took the stairs| even with trays of food| as you could wait 10 mins for an empty elevator.   Also| they never left enough shampoo and conditioner.  I called to ask for more| and they brought me lotion.  Finally| we left one day at 10AM and returned at 4PM and they still hadn't cleaned our room| but we were in the room for a couple of hours before our evening activity so our room just didn't get cleaned that day.  That was annoying.   The front desk was great and everyone was very friendly| but they seriously need to rethink the elevator situation.,Apr 22| 2019,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
All just spot on for us| it’s a city rooms are going to be small but they were really nice! Breakfast was PACKED but always found a seat and hey it’s NYC. The staff were amazing| one girl on reception was a bit off hand a few times but she was pregnant so probably just tired :-),Apr 22| 2019,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
The room was very dirty The sheets smelled |three slow elevators that serve 39 floors |A very small dining room that did not fit the number of people|The only thing that was positive was the locationnot coming back,Apr 21| 2019,2,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
The hotel is centrally located for site seeing. There are 39 floors and only 3 elevators in the entire place| we always had to give ourselves extra time just to wait for an elevator.  On top of that I was stuck in one of the elevators so after that incident we were only comfortable using 2 of the 3| making our wait even longer.  The hotel offers free breakfast| unfortunately there is such a small number of tables making breakfast a disaster.  People were eating standing up or had the option of taking their plates to another floor where the terrace is located but again with the limited number of elevators your breakfast is cold before you even get on an elevator.  Customer Service is awful. You have to call several times if you need something like towels.  Their wi-fi is a joke| you have to log into it every time you return to the hotel even if you set your devise to remember that connection and sometimes it doesn't even work.  Most hotels ask that you put a credit card on file when you first check in| for some reason they did not ask us to this.  Two days into our stay we ordered room service then again on the 4th day| we were there a total of 7 nights.  For some reason they waited until our last day to call our room at six in the morning to demand we come downstairs and put a credit card on file.  When you are in New York you stay up late| its a given so why would you call a guest at 6 a.m.  The reasonable thing would have been to call us after the first room service charge.,Apr 21| 2019,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

The hotel was very nice and clean. The location was great-its within walking distance of many landmarks and subway stations. My only complaint is that the front desk staff while efficient were not going above and beyond. They did not explain anything about the hotel or the stay. On check-in all they said was what my room number was and where the elevator was. NOTHING about how to use the elevator or that the hotel had free drinks and snacks at the hotel reception on the 4th floor. They did not even offer anything about the Hilton Honors program. They OFFERED no helpful info unless asked. Nice hotel and nice price but don't expect any info from the front desk.,Apr 6| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
Because I booked  with Hotel. com they gave me handicapped room with view of air conditioner. They also would not honor my Hilton Gold membership. Finally reluctantly moved me to a different room which was a little better. Rooms at this hotel are very small . Breakfast is good but extremely crowded and difficult to find a seat . There is a nice Irish sports bar just outside the back door and through the garage of the hotel.

We stayed there for our anniversary. The room was tiny. There wasn’t a cocktail hour which is who we book there. Vouchers were given for one drink at a bar a block away. When you want to chill out after a long day that’s the last thing you want to do. The elevators are a nightmare. We carried our luggage down after a 25 minute wait.,Mar 18| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
The property is in a good location only a couple of blocks from subway and close to a lot of restaurants. The room was ok but they have a 3rd floor room reserved that is right under the kitchen/dining area so mornings are loud. We asked to move but the lady at front desk said they were booked. The manager at breakfast| Rick?| was awesome. He kept guest and staff moving and all the food well stocked. Nicely done because it gets busy up there.

Our stay was amazing and went by perfectly| we were sad to leave! Firstly| the location of the hotel was great: it was perfect for exploring the town - very central-Manhattan| walkable distance to quite a lot of tourist attractions| not a long subway ride from not-so-walkable ones| a lot of restaurants and shops nearby.As for the hotel itself - the staff was super helpful and beyond nice. The room (and the view) surpassed our expectations: it was very spacious with plenty of room for two large suitcases| ourselves and all of our stuff (although the closet could be a bit bigger and more storage space| in general| could be useful...)| the bed was super comfortable| the sheets were nice| the tv was big| the shower was huge for New York| the room in general was super clean. There was plenty of natural and artificial light| the floor to ceiling windows with iconic views was a nice touch too :) The lobby downstairs has some nice "chilling" areas too| which we sadly only discovered when leaving| there is a beautiful modern 24hr gym| the breakfast is great with a big selection and made to order omelettes (for which a super nice guy also places an order for you via an ipad). All in all| I would definitely recommend the hotel and would happily stay there again! It's been an absolute pleasure staying at Embassy suites by Hilton :),Mar 11| 2019,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
Elevator was less than adequate| even through the week when it wasn’t as busy.Room was tiny| not enough value for money. The door actually scrapped on the bed when opening it.No alcohol on site| this was somewhat rectified by the issuing of 4 drink vouchers| however we were less then impressed with that.The breakfast area was extremely small especially on the week where we had to wait for half an hour for seats. The one highlight of this area was the man we assumed to be the supervisor| he was extremely helpful.,Mar 7| 2019,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

There was plenty of natural and artificial light| the floor to ceiling windows with iconic views was a nice touch too :) The lobby downstairs has some nice "chilling" areas too| which we sadly only discovered when leaving| there is a beautiful modern 24hr gym| the breakfast is great with a big selection and made to order omelettes (for which a super nice guy also places an order for you via an ipad). All in all| I would definitely recommend the hotel and would happily stay there again! It's been an absolute pleasure staying at Embassy suites by Hilton :),Mar 11| 2019,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
Elevator was less than adequate| even through the week when it wasn’t as busy.Room was tiny| not enough value for money. The door actually scrapped on the bed when opening it.No alcohol on site| this was somewhat rectified by the issuing of 4 drink vouchers| however we were less then impressed with that.The breakfast area was extremely small especially on the week where we had to wait for half an hour for seats. The one highlight of this area was the man we assumed to be the supervisor| he was extremely helpful.,Mar 7| 2019,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
The view is awesome and the breakfast is delicious,Mar 7| 2019,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
The bed was nice and cozy and the breakfast buffet was really good.  I wish the room was larger and if only the hotel had a pool.  Thanks for the stay.,Feb 15| 2019,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

Beautiful new and clean hotel. Gorgeous breakfast with so much choice. Spacious room (despite previous comments). Shame there was no "bar" and one of the reception staff was borderline rude - not sure what her issue was as she had the same brusque attitude during 2 separate encounters - everyone else was very welcoming however.,Feb 12| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
There was noise in the walls. We asked them to assess the situation and we were told that they are working on replacing old pipes and this is the noise we were hearing. They offered to compensate with the equivalent of $20 in Hilton honor points when I spent $600. The front desk staff that assisted us was loud until we told them the issue in front of other guests at which point they pulled us aside very quietly. Truly disappointing! Elevator were so slow that people were taking the stairs. Great location but needs major improvement.

Fantastic variety of fresh fruit and hot food. Although at times it was very crowded and hard to find a table. Evening complimentary drinks and snacks on the 4th floor was really enjoyable after a day of sightseeing.For us travelling as a couple with a 14 year old the room was a little small.

The hotel is clean| and the rooms are comfortable| if a bit bizarre. Our closet was right next to the toilet in the bathroom. The main problems were poor planning. The hotel has only 3 elevators and 39 floors. Ten minute waits for an elevator were common.  The breakfast/reception area was enirely too small. Our first and only experience with the breakfast buffet was like Black Friday with crowds| shoving| pushing| and near fights. There was nowhere to sit| and many of the serving dishes were empty. The staff was pleasant but snarky or absent. When we checked in| we were informed they had a room for us that was “the type of room Travelocity provides.” It was not| by any stretch of the imagination a suite. Other interactions with staff were extremely limited since we only caught site of the bellhop once| and there was no concierge. The maid service was once a day| period. Because of that| there were piles of dirty dishes| trash bags| etc. in the hallways most of the day.

A very small closet for hanging clothes and no dresser for clothes.  There is a drawer under bed,Nov 26| 2018,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
Room was very small| not as pictured. Room service did a very basic job| didn't refill shampoo| conditioner etc. or replace towels. Dining rooms were squishy and overcrowded. We had to take our food to the room since there weren't ever any open tables. Worse than any other hotel I've stayed at.,Nov 26| 2018,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
Very central hotel| ideal for sightseeing or shopping. Walking distance to lots of areas. Complimentary breakfast| hot & cold foods| great selection.,Nov 22| 2018,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
We had a great stay! I'll be coming back next time I'm in NY.,Nov 21| 2018,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

Our room was a billion times better than I expected. Yeah| it was spendy but wow| clean| comfortable| convenient location and the view from our balcony was breathtaking,Oct 20| 2018,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
Hotel staff| especially the evening manager on Saturday October 13 was exceptionally helpful and accommodating! My wallet was lost while my daughter and I were on a city tour and he really went out of his way to make sure we were taken care of. He even called the closest western union| explained my situation and prearranged a wire transfer that my husband and I didn’t think was possible due to the fact that I didn’t have any identification. If it weren’t for his kindness and willingness to help the rest of our weekend would have been miserable. Thanks again!,Oct 19| 2018,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
Nice comfortable stay. The staff was really friendly. the rooms are big| beds really comfortable| and very quiet hallways. The breakfast was very good| many choices.

What a way to finish off a trip of a lifetime. Right in the centre of New York| close to the Empire state building and Times Square.  Reception staff were welcoming and helpful.

Excellent 😊,Oct 17| 2018,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

Everything was perfect| except check in. They do room inspections at each check in. So once I checked in| I still had to wait about 20 min for them to do their inspection and give me a room key. I wasn’t expecting that and I had a meeting to get to do it was a little annoying. Never stayed at a hotel that did inspections like that. I think they’re intentions were good. Oh well. Other than that the staff and room were great.,Oct 6| 2018,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

Good location with easy access to mid-town sights| there is construction going on in that area| but it only made getting in and out difficult.  My room wasn't ready at check-in time| but otherwise the service was very good.  Breakfast is OK and very crowded during peak hours.,Sep 1| 2018,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

Great location close to empire state building and easy subway access. The room is small but clean and has microwave and refrigerator. There are only 3 elevators for 39 floors and it can be a long wait to go up or down. Keep your room access card handy because you need to scan it inside the elevators to operate it. Breakfast has a great variety but not enough seating| and crowded. Overall a great stay.,Aug 26| 2018,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
This was my second time staying at this hotel. First was with a friend and this time with my husband. Both times were fantastic. My husband can be picky too and he was so impressed. We both manage in customer service and were really happy with all the staff at the Embassy. So welcoming and friendly such a great addition to the clean and great atmosphere. This will definitely be my choice hotel in NYC from now on. We even tried to add a 3rd night last minute after we checked out but they were completely booked which is completely understandable! Got to enjoy the free reception this time too which was a great start to our evenings. Elevator and breakfast gets pretty busy but there’s postings in the elevator advising best times for least amount of traffic that helped. Location is great the beds and pillows are so nice and comfy we didn’t want to get out of bed! Amazing hotel guys - definitely knocked it out of the park a second time. Can’t wait for the next trip!,Aug 25| 2018,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

They made us wait for almost 4 hours because our rooom was cancelled by hotels.com. The reason? Because we need to call/inform the hotel that we will be delayed for 2 days. It was so frustrating cause after a 24 hour flight and 2 cancelled flights because there was an accident at our airport runway where all flights were cancelled for 2 days. Our reservation was paid ahead. If not calling the hotel means loosing our reservation then why was the other room not cancelled? I cannot understand this incident.,Aug 22| 2018,1,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
we travel to new york every year  for a family holiday.  we had not stayed at this hotel before.  everything was perfect| from location to services provided| but the standout was the staff.  from the front desk to the staff at breakfast and happy hour cleaning staff|  it was unbelievable genuine kindness and care.  a special shout out to Cleo| the front desk manager| who rectified a problem at checkin| with complete grace and competence.  many thanks to all!!!!,Aug 20| 2018,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
So conveniently near restaurants| shopping| tourist  and theater destinations| we practically only needed to  walk to where we wanted to go. It was only a few  blocks away from the 34th Street Subway Station so  getting to other parts of NY was also easy. The room was more spacious than I expected and the beds were comfortable. The Breakfast Buffet was also substantial (and you can even take food to go).  They also had free drinks and socials at 5:00-7:00. Over-all| we were pretty happy with our choice and would definitely stay here again the next time we travel to NYC. :),Aug 18| 2018,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

Topp beliggenhet. Like ved subway. Veldig god frokost med bacon| pannekaker| omeletter mm. Hyggelige ansatte. Klagde på renhold da det lå en skitten sokk under ekstra sengen og potetgull på gulvet da vi kom. Etter dette ble det bra. Vifte anlegget på rommet lagde mye støy til tider| men vi ble vant til det. Lite plass til å ha klær så vi måtte ha det meste i kofferten.

O hotel é ótimo| em todos os sentidos. Com um layout moderno| o quarto tem um tamanho bom| com ótima mobília e acessórios (cafeteira| microondas| frigobar| ferro de passar e cofre). Tudo funciona perfeitamente. A cama e ótima e o banho muito bom. Os produtos de higiene ofertados são de qualidade. Hotel bem localizado em NY| com acesso ao metro em duas/três quadras. Café da manhã muito bom. De todas as críticas existentes nas outras avaliações| a única que realmente procede é o espaço dedicado para o café| que é pequeno| mas nada que atrapalhe ou prejudique. Não experimentei qualquer problema com a limpeza ou com os elevadores do hotel.

酒店很不错，地处曼哈顿midtown，去到中央公园大概20个街区，到哪里都很方便。门口有个临时停车点，所以如果开车到曼哈顿还车的话，可以先check-in，把行李放好，再把车开走。服务很好，我们走的那天，是先把行李寄存在酒店，然后去租车行租的车，门童小哥贴心地帮我们主动去拿了行李，还帮我们放到后备箱。下次来曼哈顿仍然会选择住在这里。,Sep 6| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

Das Hotel ist relativ neu und um mehr rauszuholen sind die Zimmer sehr schmal. Der Zustand ist gut. Für die Personenzahl im Hotel ist der Frühstücksraum viel zu klein. Eine Möglichkeit diesen etwas zu erweitern war meistens für private Zwecke gesperrt| somit noch kleiner.

Das Hotel ist relativ neu und um mehr rauszuholen sind die Zimmer sehr schmal. Der Zustand ist gut. Für die Personenzahl im Hotel ist der Frühstücksraum viel zu klein.

ペンステーションからスーツケースを引きずって１０分くらい。結構大変でした。３４thヘラルドスクエア駅からは徒歩数分、タイムズスクウェアへは徒歩１０分位でした。近所に２４時間営業のデリがあります。部屋はスタジオタイプにしましたがベッドエリアを仕切る壁に結構圧迫感がありました。その分ソファーは一人横になれる位の長さがありましたが。。。　ＴＶは２台、バスルームのシャワーは固定式。排水等問題ありませんでした。アメニティはシャンプー、コンディショナー、バスジェル、ボディローション、石鹸のみで簡素です。５泊しましたが朝食は毎日殆ど同じメニュー、タッチパネルでオムレツをオーダー出来ますが英語が不得手な方には正直ハードル高い感じです。果物はありますが野菜が全然なかったのは残念でした。フロントスタッフの対応は良かったです。,Apr 15| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

Abbiamo prenotato per Natale una tripla in questo albergo per la sua posizione centralissima| a pochi minuti a piedi da Times Square. Nonostante ciò| non ci tornerei. Il personale alla reception| salvo un paio di receptionist gentili e disponibili| sembrava annoiato e indifferente. Pur appartenendo alla catena  Hilton| le finiture in generale sono piuttosto scadenti. La pulizia in generale| ma in particolare nella camera| lasciava molto a desiderare. Bellissimo l’affaccio sull’Empire State (da una misera finestra) ma la camera era piccolissima: un letto king size (molto comodo) e un divano letto attaccati l’un l’altro| con le valigie e i passaggi ridotti a stento ci si muoveva. Il bagno| nonostante la doccia ampia| era anch’esso dimensionalmente ridotto al minimo e scarsamente pulito. Nella tariffa erano inclusi colazione americana a buffet| molto ricca e fornita| e l’aperitivo serale. Al piano ristorante il personale è stato più gentile e disponibile| nonostante l’ambiente caotico e l’alto afflusso di persone. Sicuramente sarebbe da migliorare il collegamento tra i piani con gli ascensori| sempre affollati e lenti. Inammissibile che una strutta di oltre 30 piani sia servita soltanto da 3 ascensori. Fortunatamente NYC è una città che offre tanto| consiglio quindi di cercare alloggio altrove| anche in altre zone meno caotiche.,Jan 1| 2019,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

El hotel no tiene ni los suficientes espacios generales para recibir una ocupación de tal magnitud| el desayuno es un caos| no hay espacio y no hay gente suficiente para retirar platos y limpiar mesas.La limpieza diaria de las habitaciones no es la adecuada| siempre tienes que pedir todos los suplementos que faltan| shampoo| papel| klennex| etc.,Jan 9| 2019,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
Utsikten var super. Nära till shopping och Metron som förövrigt är sjukt lätt att ta sig överallt och det gör inget om man åker fel för då ser man bara mer ställen.,Jan 9| 2019,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
O hotel e ótimo| perto de tudo. Café da manhã bom| funcionários cordiais e um happy hour no final do dia que quebra o galho.,Jan 7| 2019,5,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

In het centrum| veel op loopafstand. Lobby klein en fris in de winter. Incheck was later dan gezegd| hotelkamer prima. Druk! Weinig liften voor de vele verdiepingen. Verder erg tevreden!,Jan 4| 2019,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

Abbiamo prenotato per Natale una tripla in questo albergo per la sua posizione centralissima| a pochi minuti a piedi da Times Square. Nonostante ciò| non ci tornerei. Il personale alla reception| salvo un paio di receptionist gentili e disponibili| sembrava annoiato e indifferente. Pur appartenendo alla catena  Hilton| le finiture in generale sono piuttosto scadenti. La pulizia in generale| ma in particolare nella camera| lasciava molto a desiderare. Bellissimo l’affaccio sull’Empire State (da una misera finestra) ma la camera era piccolissima: un letto king size (molto comodo) e un divano letto attaccati l’un l’altro| con le valigie e i passaggi ridotti a stento ci si muoveva. Il bagno| nonostante la doccia ampia| era anch’esso dimensionalmente ridotto al minimo e scarsamente pulito. Nella tariffa erano inclusi colazione americana a buffet| molto ricca e fornita| e l’aperitivo serale. Al piano ristorante il personale è stato più gentile e disponibile| nonostante l’ambiente caotico e l’alto afflusso di persone. Sicuramente sarebbe da migliorare il collegamento tra i piani con gli ascensori| sempre affollati e lenti. Inammissibile che una strutta di oltre 30 piani sia servita soltanto da 3 ascensori. Fortunatamente NYC è una città che offre tanto| consiglio quindi di cercare alloggio altrove| anche in altre zone meno caotiche.,Jan 1| 2019,3,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

Top Lage und ingesamt tolles Hotel. Von 17-19 Uhr wurden gratis kleine Snacks und Getränke angeboten| das war wirklich nett und sehr gut besucht. Trotz gegen Aufpreis gebuchtem Ausblick-Zimmer hatten wir leider nur normalen Ausblick und keine Sicht aufs Empire State Building. Das Zimmer wurde leider nicht wirklich gründlich gereinigt| ebenso war der Teppich auf dem Flur noch jeden Abend voller Dreck| das darf in so einem Hotel nicht sein. Die Damen an der Rezeption ( besonders Ciera) sollten sich in Sachen Freundlichkeit etwas von ihrem Kollegen Armando abschauen. Dieser war sehr nett und hilfsbereit.Insgesamt haben wir uns aber sehr wohl gefühlt und würden das Hotel wieder buchen.,Dec 8| 2018,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018

Forholdsvis nyt hotel med perfekt beliggenhed tæt på Penn station| Harolds Sq (Macys) og Times Sq. Tæt på Subway ved 34th streetFint med morgenmad på hotellet| dog ikke så mange pladser| så mellem 7:30 og 8:30 kan det være svært at finde plads. Lækkert med “omelet station” så du kan bestille din omelet som du ønsker den.Perfekt værelse på 31. etage med udsigt over byen. Rengøring ok| men heller ikke mere. En dag havde de glemt rengøring| men ved henvendelse til receptionen| blev det håndteret inden for 30 min.Gratis snacks og drikkevarer med og uden alkohol hver dag ml. 17 og 19| som er meget populært.,Oct 26| 2018,4,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,60 West 37th Street| New York| NY| 10018
