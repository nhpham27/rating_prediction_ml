I was very happy with my stay. The staff was wonderful!,Feb 25| 2020,5,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
The rooms were tiny| which can be understood given it is NY. However| they were so dry and dusty that we had issues simply sleeping for the entire stay. No amount of water or keeping the windows open spared us from the dry air.Aditionally| a magical charge of $68.86 showed up on my card and there was no one to contact. Customer service directed me to concierge who was never available. I even sent an email to the address they asked me to| and no response.Was it a good stay? Sure| it offered a bed and a decently clean room. Would I stay there again? Never.,Feb 24| 2020,1,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

I booked this specifically because it was dog friendly for larger dogs. No place for the dog to use the bathroom. Their answer was pee and poop on the sidewalk. Parking was a nightmare. No valet except once you’re already in the garage. The room was falling apart and one of the most disappointing of our travels up the east coast for the cost. I booked the Hilton bc of their name and reputation. But I was very disappointed.,Feb 15| 2020,1,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

My husbend and I stayed at Hilton Midtown for 5 nights a week ago. Because it was relatively warm outside| hotel management decided to shut down whole heating system in the building. But the huge problem was that NOONE INFORMED us about that. Thinking that we put heating on high while went to bed| we slept under cold air coming out of the system.Of course I got sick| missed two meetings next day| travelled overseas in terrible condition with high fever and even now| after three days of arrival| I am on antibiotics. P.S. management did not even apologize| they just sent an extra blanket for me.,Jan 15| 2020,2,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

The room Was available early. BUT charged me 55 dollars to get in room early.  I thought this was totally wrong.   No one was going to use the room until I got in| so why charge me to get in it.  Will not be staying here again if they don’t comp me on this. And then another 34 dollars for resort fee?? Wow. Cost me 329 and 70 for parking to stay from 3pm until 12 the next day.  So overrated!!!!   400 a night| never again. Not worth it!  Off season! New Years and Christmas was over!,Jan 5| 2020,5,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

Excellent location; we were able to walk to many places and had quick access to subway.,Dec 28| 2019,4,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
Waited in line for 45 minutes to check in. Only one of our rooms was ready. Paid for both and came back later to get keys for the second room. Had to wait another 35-40 minutes just to get the keys. They only had one person running the check in area and a huge line. Couldn’t run the water in the bathroom sink for very long as it didn’t drain. Toilet didn’t work properly either. You could hear all outside noises from room all night.,Dec 28| 2019,2,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
The hotel was in the perfect location - close enough to Times Square but far enough to be away from the noise.  Short walk to the park or subway.  Hotel was very clean; nice bar & deli/store for quick bites and coffee.   Only real complaint is that the bathroom vanity space was little to none.  Would definitely stay here again.,Dec 28| 2019,5,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

Excellent location; we were able to walk to many places and had quick access to subway.,Dec 28| 2019,4,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
Waited in line for 45 minutes to check in. Only one of our rooms was ready. Paid for both and came back later to get keys for the second room. Had to wait another 35-40 minutes just to get the keys. They only had one person running the check in area and a huge line. Couldn’t run the water in the bathroom sink for very long as it didn’t drain. Toilet didn’t work properly either. You could hear all outside noises from room all night.,Dec 28| 2019,2,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
The hotel was in the perfect location - close enough to Times Square but far enough to be away from the noise.  Short walk to the park or subway.  Hotel was very clean; nice bar & deli/store for quick bites and coffee.   Only real complaint is that the bathroom vanity space was little to none.  Would definitely stay here again.,Dec 28| 2019,5,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

Overall good experience. For some reason my 3 nights stay was broken to 2 check-in.I had to come to the desk the second day to register again...,Dec 23| 2019,5,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
Great location to everything for walking.  The room was too hot and temperature wouldn’t go down.,Dec 23| 2019,3,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
Location is great and that is what you are paying for. Otherwise this is a mid level hotel| not a luxury one. Check in was awful and after going through the line three times to get rooms all on one floor|  that still didn't happen.  The manager was rude. They comped us 80 in drinks (cost us $95 at the bar for 8 people| so no great savongs| and 40 in food). You will have to pay $5 cash per bag to have bags held. Modern finish|  slapped over some aging features. No water pressure in the shower.  They were jam packed for the holidays| so that could have affected things. Overall| location is the draw.,Dec 23| 2019,3,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
I was given a room set up for handicapped persons and the shower arrangement was very difficult to use and sprayed water all over the floor outside the shower.,Dec 23| 2019,3,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

We PAID for WiFi| which didn’t work| and the phone in the room also did not work| making it difficult to call to ask about the WiFi.  The room was warm and the temperature setting would only go down to 68 degrees.The roll-in shower’s shower head pointed at the wall but was too high to move it if you were in a wheel chair. Even so| it was impossible not to soak the entire bathroom floor.The lightning in the room was poor.The curtains were on a push button system| which was a nice touch| but the buttons were relatively high on the wall| not easily accessible from a chair.,Dec 15| 2019,2,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

Absolutely NOT WORTH the star rating - probably will be a 2-3 star for what I can see.  This hotel has been around for ~20+ years.  Price was VERY HIGH for the quality of service you receive. We checked in around 11pm| was quick but lack manners. Upon entering the room| it smelt like sweat.  Horrible| but we were very tired after flying the entire day. Next morning we left for breakfast early and went site seeing. Came back shortly after and saw a housekeeping maid standing outside our room talking on a phone leaning against the wall. The worst thing was what appeared to be fresh clean towels ON THE FLOOR outside our door (see pictures).  What kind of person will put bath / hand towels ON PUBLIC FLOORS!!!!!!! Think about the germs / dirt / fungus etc that's been laying on the public floor and you wipe that onto your body?  Also the bed linens are very course / rough - feels cheap. Check out was bad too. We checked out early. The check out person at the front desk also had bad manners| I gave him the key cards told him my room number. He took the key card| rest by the keyboard and continued to work on other stuff for a minute| w/out saying anything| while looking elsewhere sometime.  No thank you| no nothing. period. First time staying here and will be our last!,Dec 15| 2019,2,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
We (two women) arrived in NYC at 1:00 am due to a flight delay| and the man at the registration desk said he couldn’t let us check in because I had used my husband’s Hotels.com account to book our stay. I had paid in full using MY credit card| which I had with me and was noted on my paperwork| along with my name. I gave all of this to the clerk| but he said he still couldn’t give us the room as it was against policy and he didn’t want to get in trouble. He was essentially turning us out into the streets| when I had paid in full for your hotel AND had the paperwork to prove it. The clerk told me he needed to talk to my husband| so I got him on the phone for the clerk| but then he still said no| he couldn’t let us check in. Then he said I had to call Expedia because in the computer the reservation was made on Expedia| even though I told him I went through Hotels.com| and showed him my confirmation from them. So| next I spent several more minutes calling Expedia| only for them to tell me that my confirmation number wasn’t from them. Next| the clerk told me to call Hotels.com.| which I did| but then the clerk refused to talk to them| because he said they needed to call your hotel directly. After 45 minutes of this nonsensical runaround| he FINALLY gave us our room.  He said I should have booked directly through the hotel and not with Hotels.com. Our treatment was completely  uncalled for| unprofessiand and unacceptable.,Dec 13| 2019,3,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

It’s weird because it really all boils down to the noise level inside of my room.

We purposely booked a room that was billed as handicap accessible. Unfortunately| the roll-in shower was not properly designed and water flooded the bathroom floor every time we used the shower. We needed to put five or six towels down on the floor every time we use the shower to mop up all the water. The staff was very helpful with bringing  us towels as requested| but in my mind the room was just in adequate for handicap person.This is also the first major hotel that I’ve stayed in that did not have a mini fridge| a coffee maker| robes or room service. Because we were in New York City it was easy to use Seamless for food delivery| but I was disappointed that there was not in House room service available for us. I would not recommend this hotel| and would certainly not stay there again. The only plus was the friendliness of the staff. They were helpful| courteous and professional.,Nov 13| 2019,2,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

We purposely booked a room that was billed as handicap accessible. Unfortunately| the roll-in shower was not properly designed and water flooded the bathroom floor every time we used the shower. We needed to put five or six towels down on the floor every time we use the shower to mop up all the water. The staff was very helpful with bringing  us towels as requested| but in my mind the room was just in adequate for handicap person.This is also the first major hotel that I’ve stayed in that did not have a mini fridge| a coffee maker| robes or room service. Because we were in New York City it was easy to use Seamless for food delivery| but I was disappointed that there was not in House room service available for us. I would not recommend this hotel| and would certainly not stay there again. The only plus was the friendliness of the staff. They were helpful| courteous and professional.,Nov 13| 2019,2,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
The property was not clean. It's really disappointing for that price. I had a great woman for the check in. Check out was done by a ridiculous man who didn't care about customer... staff need to be improved,Nov 12| 2019,2,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

I booked with Expedia a room with a bathtub| however| when I arrived I was told there are no rooms with a bathtub available and that I could ask to be moved the next day. I was given a room with a shower. The room looked old and smelled unpleasantly. The next day I was given a room with a bathtub| which was in much better condition than the first one. We went to the bar to use the hotel credit and we were not the only guests who noticed they were served something else than ordered. All together we consumed less than $60 of the credit we had| so I was told I was ok at the checkout. However| my credit card was charged on the day that I checked out $82.12.

Many "convenience" fees or "resort" fees for stuff that is grossly over priced and then they give you coupons to reduce the price to less-grossly overpriced... what a deal!  I think you have to deal with this everywhere and until the hidden fee / resort fee lawsuit that is currently ongoing is over... Enjoy your stay!  Nothing particularly good or bad here but the breakfast down the road| either direction| are great and cheaper than the normal cost + resort fees - coupons at the motel.  Total confusion with their bait and switch shell game of fees.  Find a motel that doesn't have all these weird add on fees and you'll be ahead.,Oct 13| 2019,3,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

We had the most unpleasant experience compared to other hotels we have stayed in New York| we had to change rooms three times during a 5 night stay because of hotel mistakes and because unprogrammed maintenance| we felt the rooms were dusty| one out of three elevators to our floor didn't work| and the fornt desk staff's servis was poor.  We received a one night refund in compensation for the inconveniences| I guess it is fair enough.,Sep 13| 2019,2,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
Staff was unfriendly and not helpful!The location is great!,Sep 13| 2019,4,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
It was clean.  There were problems with elevators which meant we had to wait a bit longer than planned.  Also| it would be nice to have complementary water or coffee to available in the rooms such as what is offered with other chains like Marriott,Sep 10| 2019,4,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
Great weekend with my wife.  We enjoyed the stay.  The room was clean and tidy.  No disappointments whatsoever.   I would recommend to a friend.,Sep 10| 2019,4,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

I liked how it was close to a lot of things in the middle of the city. I think the elevators were an issue since it took a long time to get one and they were usually crammed. Also I recommend letting guests know they get a $30 credit to their room every day.,Sep 9| 2019,4,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

Check in had extra fees that were rudely explained. The female bartender was incredible and very friendly. There was no fitted sheet on the bed so the regular sheet kept moving meaning that I was touching the yucky mattress pad most of the night. Check out was supposed to be at 12:00 and a staff member let him/herself into our room at 9:15 and woke us up. Good sized room. Cheap toilet paper.

Well it started off not so great by us getting a room that was already being occupied. Someone's belongings were in the room and the room was not fully cleaned. At first the hotel wanted to grab the persons items and have us keep the room. No! We need another room. Due to having the room issue my friend and I missed our event. Other than offering a new room the hotel did nothing for us. I'm not one to cause a scene or overreact when this type of thing happens. But something woild've been nice. We could not get a refund for our event because it was too close to the time for the event and 24 hours is needed. If we knew beforehand we would miss the activity we would've canceled. There's $52 we didn't and won't get back. Other than that the staff is very nice and professional. The hotel and new room we stayed in was very nice.

A great stay in NYC. Fabulous location| excellent service| huge room for NYC! We arrived early on check in day and were able to get right in to our room.

Housekeepers super friendly and always saying hi and smiling. Only complaint- the WiFi was weird. I kept getting kicked off even after entering the password.

The Midtown Hilton is in a perfect location!  Walking distance to Central Park| Rockefeller Center| Time Square| museums| theaters and Broadway.  It’s accommodations are wonderful and staff incredible!

Excellent hotel - elegant and clean. Amazing breakfast. Centrally located. Parking is expensive| though. Not a problem if you don't have a car| but we had one.,Aug 2| 2019,5,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

PROS1. We had corner room #808 and the view was nice2. Room was clean w/o any bugsCONS1. Check in/out lines were always crowded and took too long. There were not enough desk clerks.  Same issue with long lines at the hotels cafe "Urban Kitchen."2. MAJOR ISSUE was the rooms are not equipped with a coffee maker or microwave oven. At the price and type of hotel this is| these should be standard equipment. Hotel should also provide free coffee in the lobby.3. City lost electrical power the first day of our stay and it caused havoc with the elevators knocking many out of commission all week long. This caused major elevator overcrowding and long wait times to catch one4. Bathroom was small with sink so close to the toilet.5. Bathroom sink had sharp corners and we kept impaling ourselves on it when using the toilet6. Bathroom sink design was not very good as water did not drain off it's top into the bowl but rather leaves a lot of standing water7. Shower stall has peeling paint on the ceiling and some spots of mildew in the tub caulking8. Blackout curtains need a vertical section installed on one end to prevent light from coming in9. Room cabinet that holds the safe and refrigerator has a lot of water damage on top of it and needs to be replaced10. Had to relog into WiFi every single day,Jul 21| 2019,3,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
Hilton is generally a reliable hotel.  The Hilton in NYC is not a good choice if senior citizen.   Lobby very noisy.   When I was there a bus load of teenagers.   One person doing regular checkin.  I waited in line for over ONE hour.   No place for me to sit.   Other than that clean hotel. Good location.,Jul 21| 2019,3,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

The staff was not forthcoming with pricing.   From the food to the parking the staff made it appear every thing was taken care of upon check in.   Imagine my surprise when the staff stated we had to put down $150 deposit and the only money returned was $34.    During our stay we “received a food credit”.   The only food we had at your restaurant was  1 cup of coffee| a croissant  and a bagel.   Upon getting our car we were given a bill for $140.   I do not appreciate being what it amounts to is lied to.,Jun 15| 2019,2,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

Everything Was great except the 1st night. When I checked in at 4:30PM they said they were sold out of rooms and only put me in a room that was the size of a closet. I prepaid $2500 6 weeks ago. Why wasn’t a room held for me. I stayed there many times and have always been pleased. I had to move the next afternoon which messed up my day. Pack and unpack double times.

Room and property need updating. Stains on couches. Coffee table in living room was filthy. When I asked for pull out to be made| staff seemed annoyed to have to make the bed. When he opened up the pullout| sheets and blanket from previous guest was still on the pull out. He pulled all the sheets off the bed| then left it in a pile outside the room - I had to request the front desk to have it removed an hour later.

Extremely outdated| especially for the price. You’re paying for the name ( which is not even great ) but this hotel is nothing special. It’s crowded| dirty and old.

Computer problem at check in| took us 45mins to get to the room.

Great location| walking distance to a lot of attractions| check in was very quick| the room was as described and a bit larger than expected - executive suite. We found the arrangement of lamps/lighting a bit odd. There was some trash left under the sofa by a previous guest but overall very clean and cleaned daily. Breakfast 5 times out of six had plenty of food available| one day we arrived late at 10am and there was little choice left mainly cold food even though they serve until 11am. Breakfast staff were excellent| food good quality although if it hadn't been included in the room rate I wouldn't have paid the 38.95 they were asking to pay on the door| far too much! and 5 dollars each for storing our suitcases for a couple of hours was extortionate.

I would never stay at thus Hilton again. The hotel staff was extremely unapproachable and basically rude. There was no coffee pot in the room and they also charged 5 a bag to hold luggage.

Everything about this property leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Service is absolutely nonexistent. They charged $55.00 extra if you arrive before 3:00pm to check in. They charge $30.00 per day extra for no reason at all --- which is illegal. They don't honor your Hilton Honors status at all. They open your room door without even knocking. They have no umbrellas when it rains. They don't offer free water in the room even tho Hilton is supposed to. Everything was quite terrible.,May 7| 2019,1,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
WATCH OUT FR THE EXTRA "URBAN SERVICE" FEE... Ridiculous extra fee for nothing,May 7| 2019,3,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
Old| dirty and expensive. I didn’t like that they charge you 5 dollars per bag to leave them for a few hours and on top of that they only take cash. They also have the nerve to say that tip is not included.,May 7| 2019,2,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

The room smells cigarette| no refrigerator and no TV controller. So I called them to change the room because we do not want to stay for 3 nights without refrigerator.They said they would send people to spray out and have a controller. Some room does not have refrigerator. That's it. They hung up the phone while I was still talking. It was not nice though I understood they are treating thousands of customers.We were on 12th floor which has not remodeled yet. My friend's 6th floor was much nicer and new TV| chair| sofa| and amenities.But other than that| the location was so great to access to anywhere and other people were nice.,Apr 3| 2019,3,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

No microwave in the room| have to pay for it. Make you pay a 75 dollar check in fee and may you get a  food ticket that allows for you to purchase food within the hotel.

The room smells cigarette| no refrigerator and no TV controller. So I called them to change the room because we do not want to stay for 3 nights without refrigerator.They said they would send people to spray out and have a controller. Some room does not have refrigerator. That's it. They hung up the phone while I was still talking. It was not nice though I understood they are treating thousands of customers.We were on 12th floor which has not remodeled yet. My friend's 6th floor was much nicer and new TV| chair| sofa| and amenities.But other than that| the location was so great to access to anywhere and other people were nice.,Apr 3| 2019,3,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

Beautiful hotel| clean rooms. VERY busy - the lobby always had a ton of people in it. Don't expect any free amenities - no coffee maker in the rooms| free wifi only for Hilton Honors members (which we are| so I'm not sure how much it cost). $50 charge to check in early.

Upon arriving we checked in. The lobby is very nice| so that's always a good sign. We checked in and the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable. It was late and we were in need of something quick to eat| so they made a few good recommendations. The rooms here clean and very spacious for NYC. Everything seemed to be (somewhat) recently updated. Beds are very comfortable. TVs are newer and they provide premium channels which is always a plus. Bathrooms are nothing special| but still very nice. As far as other amenities go| they have a great little place for coffee/breakfast/snacks called Herb N' Kitchen. They also have a couple of bars to grab a bite or some drinks.

We happened to be there at the same time as 100's of students from all over the world which made it a bit loud| busy and overcrowded.  Would have been nice to know that was going on prior to our booking.Other than that our stay was good.Sheldon Satterthwaite,Mar 10| 2019,4,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

Room could have benefited from a refresh... nothing too bad,Mar 4| 2019,4,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
sink was extremely small and the makeup mirror was so low that you had to put your face in the sink to see in the makeup mirror....don't know what they were thinking to put the mirror in that location....rooms could be updated a bit...,Mar 4| 2019,4,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
The room was conveniently located near the elevator. Room was spacious| without coffee machine| microwave or mini fridge. I understand this is a way to lead people to the restaurants in the lobby. Heater was not working. Complaint to customer service saw maintenance arrive in 45 minutes to take care of the minor issue. Breakfast was plentiful and with varied choices. Lobby was noisy| to be expected in this location. Overall| nothing extraordinary. Price of food was as expected in nyc - small bottle of water - $4| 1 small banana - $2.,Mar 3| 2019,3,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

The location is great. The fact that I did not earn Hilton Honors points for this stay Because it was through Travelocity I found to be very disappointing. Also I was not able to use the two credits that were mandatory and missed out on approximately $70.,Feb 19| 2019,4,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

Customer service was good but our room felt like a sauna. Everyone was complaining about how hot it was. Considering heat rises and all rooms are on upper floors| it was miserable. We tried cracking the windows (they only lift up two inches) but that did no good. It was 80-85 and freezing outside. You’d think they’d have better temperature control.,Feb 19| 2019,3,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
I should not have been charged a daily $25 amenity fee. Never have been charged before. Booked a queen size bed & received a smaller bed & room was much smaller than past. Probably will not return Thank You Ed Evanoff,Feb 19| 2019,1,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
Was not happy with mandatory $25 /per night “urban destination fee” that was added on.  This should have just been added to the nightly room rate since we did not have a choice. This was not one of the taxes cities impose but rather a hotel charge,Feb 19| 2019,4,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

I booked a room here for convenience because I was attending an event at the hotel that night.  Upon arrival they checked me into a room that was already occupied and getting it resolved cost me all the time that I had planned to get ready for the black tie event and I was actually late to the party because of their incompetence.  The managers took too long to resolve the situation and they did not even express any apology or concern that they ruined the start of my evening.  For what it cost me including overnight parking they should be ashamed.  I did not even receive a courtesy call or follow up from them.,Jan 26| 2019,1,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

Small room off odd hallway w/ closet for housekeeping. Fridge removed from room. Bathroom faucet leaked. Rail in bathroom broken. Toilet barely flushed & stopped flushing entirely. Called to report toilet. Was transferred to another extension while mid sentence. Ext. rang 25x's- no answer. Called again. After 40 min waiting for someone to fix toilet| got dressed| left room to find lobby toilet. Passed repair guy in hall. Ridiculous. Worst room ever.,Jan 21| 2019,3,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
Our suite was quite large| which is unusual in New York. The decor is extremely dated. The continental breakfast at the Executive Dining Room was the worst I've ever experienced. Even cheap hotels do better. Really a disgrace.,Jan 9| 2019,2,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

Stayed two days in early January.  Urban King room was nice size with nice view.  Rate on expedia was excellent.  Previous week was twice as much.  Check-in person was especially pleasant.  Check-out line in morning was way too long.  Need to put more people on at checkout time.  Hotel location is excellent to everything... right in the heart of midtown.  Easy to get to Broadway shows| restaurants| etc...Would definitely stay there again,Jan 8| 2019,4,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
I loved the location. It's close to everything that a first time visitor needs to see. The only thing I didn't like is that they charge $5 a bag to hold your luggage after the check out.,Jan 8| 2019,4,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

We decided to take a trip to NYC a few days before New Years.  We expected it to be busy and it was!!  BUT| the Hilton Midtown did everything in their power to accommodate the hoards of people who were showing up.  We waited in a bit of a line to check in but they walked around with bottled water for everyone.  We also waited in a line for breakfast| but they were so friendly and accommodating to our large group (7 people).  The breakfast was great!  The stay was great!  The room décor could be improved but it was still comfortable.  The staff was friendly and I can't say anything bad.  They did their best given the circumstances (NYE in NYC!)....

This property has no idea how to mange the large volume of guests. Check-in was over an hour even though we are Hilton rewards members and should have been able to check-in with our phone. The reasoning as to why it took so long was that staff was on break. I am certainly all about staff taking a break but when check-in is at 3pm| why in the world would you not send them all before that.  Despite telling us over and over that it was the busiest week out of the year| they ran out of everything and handled staffing in ways that made no sense.To be fair| the staff ( servers and housekeeping) worked hard. Out of 5 days our room stayed dirty one day until it was time to go back to sleep. We found popcorn and other food items on the floor in our room - which were items we never ate. So don’t feel the room was cleaned very well.,Jan 3| 2019,1,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

On the 23rd floor near the elevators was very noisy in the room above and in the hallway.

However| I wasn't in a hurry then.) On the day I was checking out| I had an appointment to meet a friend. I allowed 15 minutes in my schedule| but that wasn't enough.However| once I got to check-out| in addition to apologizing immediately for the wait| the clerk also cancelled out the "Resort fee" of $25 per day as well as an additional $25 on my bill from the restaurant.

This is a very busy hotel but a great location in NYC.  If you are driving it is very difficult to pull up to the front of the hotel on 6th avenue.  Also| their valet parking is a few blocks away.

Unfortunately| in NYC you are unable to make a left at all of these lights.  You end up several blocks away and if you are not careful| you will end up at the Hilton located in 2 blocks away.  Also| there is no coffee machine in the room| no bags to be found if you wanted ice and no cups for your room.,Jan 1| 2019,3,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

Beautiful property. Ridiculously overpriced food and no access to anything like coffee or even a drink machine without going to the lobby and paying out the nose for it.

We checked in Christmas Day and when we arrived the line was almost out the door and there were 2 clerks checking people in.  We had lunch and tried again but the line was just as long| but fortunately they had more clerks.  We were there 3 days and saw this same line everyday.  The rooms are spacious and the location is excellenr.  The bar had no Ginger Beer to make Moscow Mules which seems strange since it’s such a popular drink.  They also had no regular olives for my martini| only Bleu Chrese and the bartender put them in my drink without asking me.  The coffee is great there but the line each morning when we woke up was at least 15 minutes to get coffee.,Dec 29| 2018,4,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

It’s a great location and nice hotel. Rooms with fridges should have microwaves. I was very upset there was not a single drinking fountain in the building and you’d have to pay $4 for a small bottle of water if you didn’t want to leave the hotel. I was pregnant with two children| so that was pretty disappointing. Other than that-we had a wonderful stay.,Dec 28| 2018,3,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

Nice hotel ubication| only a couple blocks from Rockefeller Center and Times Square.,Dec 29| 2018,4,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
We checked in Christmas Day and when we arrived the line was almost out the door and there were 2 clerks checking people in.  We had lunch and tried again but the line was just as long| but fortunately they had more clerks.  We were there 3 days and saw this same line everyday.  The rooms are spacious and the location is excellenr.  The bar had no Ginger Beer to make Moscow Mules which seems strange since it’s such a popular drink.  They also had no regular olives for my martini| only Bleu Chrese and the bartender put them in my drink without asking me.  The coffee is great there but the line each morning when we woke up was at least 15 minutes to get coffee.,Dec 29| 2018,4,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

The hotel check in took more than an hour. They didn’t have enough personnel for the amount of guests. Tables at the bars were absolutely dirty| empty cups all around| the Executive Lounge had the soda machine broken| coffee machines broken.

Lines hours long| no answer on customer service phone.|  TV check bill/ check out procedure not working|  "free internt but $1.00/minute to us business center.  Very confusing $25 per night bar/restraunt credit badly designed.  Hard to believe it is really a Hilton.,Dec 28| 2018,1,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
We stayed from December 21st to the 25th & were booked across from Housekeeping.  In the morning| we were awakened by the cackling in the hallway outside our room by the Housekeepers reporting for work.  On the day that we were checking out| Housekeeping entered our room twice without waiting for us to answer her quick knock.  Check out is 12 noon and both times were before that.  Twice during this stay| the elevator stopped working.  No fun to have to walk up or down 9 flights of stairs.  And now I was charged 3 times on my credit card for the destination fee| I called the Hotel and was transferred from switchboard to front desk to accounting.  I left a message (their message says they will respond within 24 hours - NOT) & also sent an email to which I have also not received a reply.  Although this was my 3rd visit to this property| I'm not sure I would stay again.,Dec 27| 2018,3,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
Location is really good | prices for a breakfast buffet was to expensive at $50 per person | because of not choices a la carte ... when we just want it two eggs and coffee.. it’s a big hotel and elevators and check out time got really busy to take and huge waiting time,Dec 27| 2018,3,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
The service was poor.  Surly staff.  Bars| restaurant and grab and go place all understaffed.  We had awful service at each place. Really irritating that they automatically charge your gratuity and staff was terrible!  Great location| but the lack of service will prevent me from returning.!!,Dec 27| 2018,3,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
This hotel is huge and is a constant madhouse. We chose this hotel because of its proximity to the Radio City Rockettes. When we arrived there were probably 100 people in line to check in. We checked our bags and came back later and waited about 45 minutes in line. Our guest services guy was nice| but other than the valet and housekeeping the rest of staff are very unfriendly. The charge requiring you to eat or drink daily is absurd. Not having coffee makers in the room when you have to wait in line so long downstairs is not convenient. I felt faint from waiting so long for an elevator the morning of check out and sat at the closed bar where I was ran off by a very rude employee without a name tag. What harm is there in sitting at a closed bar when there were no other seats around? Not impressed with this Hilton hotel at all and will not stay again.,Dec 27| 2018,3,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

I normally stay at the Marriott Marquis when I come to NYC. This time I decided to stay at the Hitlon for convenience to Radio City on a rainy Friday.We tried to check in at 3:05.  Our room was not available but they said we could downgrade.  We opted to wait and come back in 2 hours.  We wanted use the hotel credits we paid for on a late lunch and drinks but because we did not have a room we could not charge them to a room. So we couldn’t use the credit we are forced to but.  We can back at 5:30 and were given room keys and told they could see what they could do about the charges.  Nothing has happened at this point to those charges a couple days later. We got to our room and the keys didn’t work.  Came back and stood in the holiday lines which we expected for a third time to find we were given the wrong room number.  We finally got to our room running late to get ready for Our Reservation to find not enough room towels. We made it work with  what we had.  We called 2 different times for towels and never received them.  I ended up going and finding housekeeping in a hallway and got 2 towels. In edition to all that the service in the bar and food areas was extremely slow and at times felt ignored. I am disappointed because I am a fan of Hilton as a whole but this experience was disappointing.,Dec 23| 2018,2,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
The unexpected destination deposit of $25/day which could be used against certain purchases at the hotel (but not breakfast in the dining room) seemed like a poorly concealed means of either increasing the daily room rate or forcing you to spend additional money in the hotel. Just like the airlines - extra unexpected charges that nickel and dime us to death!

Average amenities- nothing too fancy. Had 2 rooms| a was told at registration counter at 5:30 pm| one was not clean yet. Had to check into one room and did not get into other room until hours later.

I love everything about this place. The only problem was they didn’t have enough stuff members to help out with checking in and checking out. We had to stand in line to just get our room keys| we have checked in in the morning but rooms were not ready and when we came back around 4:00 we had to stand in the same line that people who were checking in. That could manage that differently| they also didn’t aware us about discount for restaurant that we were in title for staying in the hotel.,Nov 17| 2018,5,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

First and foremost| we had an amazing time staying out your Hotel. Mei at the front desk was the best! The only suggestions I will give you is if you are going to have a refrigerator in the rooms- you should always have a microwave in the same room. We needed a microwave and didn't have one to heat up our leftovers. Another suggestion - the bathroom downstairs near the luggage storage was used as a changing room. I stood in a line for 10 minutes to use the bathroom. After entering the bathroom - I saw young college students using the restroom only to change. They took up the stalls for this and that wasn't fair. You should make 1 stall for changing or post a note stating that they have to use another facility for that.,Nov 12| 2018,4,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

I had read this hote was renovated in 2015....  certainly not our room.  Relatively clean but pretty dated and worn out.  Comfortable beds and bedding.  Small bathroom with a closet the same size as the bathroom which seems kind of useless in a hotel room...should’ve taken some room from the huge closet to make the bathroom easier to move around.  And no coffee maker ???  Maybe because it’s NYC but we’ve never been to a hotel room without a coffee maker...,Nov 12| 2018,3,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

I booked a 2 night stay| that had one confirmation number for the reservation. The reservation was referred to as a "2 part" reservation because one night was a non-refundable rate. The hotel somehow considered this two 1-night reservations| so at 655pm on my 2nd night at the hotel| they called me and I had to pack up all my belongings and go downstairs| stand in line| and check in again| to another room. I have no idea what they would have done| if I had been gone| which I was going to be in another 30 minutes. Unbelievable experience. Their excuse was that they had promised that end of the floor to a group. How did they not figure it out until 655pm? I would be interested to know if hotels.com did indeed send them two 1-night reservations| even though my confirmation showed one 2-night reservation.

Room service was knocking on the door everyday around 8:30. Overall it's nice| but for the price of it they should invest into some new furniture...,Oct 12| 2018,4,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

The hotel was very good| a little bit old in the decor and it feels like a very used hotel| with a little bit of the infrastructure in need for replacement. The fitness center was very very good| with plenty of machines and space to weight train and stretch.  The staff were very courteous and the breakfast setting was great.  The area is very convenient with both Central Park| and Times Square only a few blocks away.

The hotel was great as far as check-in and my room was clean. I arrived late at almost midnight and was given a room on the 49th floor. My only request was a quiet room away from the elevator. So...of course my room was right next to the elevator! I was too exhausted to haul myself down to the front desk with my luggage so just sucked it up and stayed there. The room was also next to a supply closet which staff accessed at 1:30am while chatting loudly in the hallway. Otherwise the hotel is great and well situated. Beware...Overnight parking was $75!!,Oct 4| 2018,4,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

Upon arrival our daughter's bed was not made up. Old |worn out rooms. Absence of cleaning and vacuuming the dirtiest carpets we've ever seen in a $400 per day hotel. Found contact lenses from previous customers left by the window.They are still there.... We had to ask for sheets to get changed otherwise the staff does not do it.In short cleaning means just making up the beds.,Jan 5| 2020,2,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

Questo Hilton non è buono! Altri forse si ma questo lasciamolo stare. Si capisce che| siccome è troppo grosso e ci sono un mare di clienti non riescono a curarlo come si deve| non riescono a gestirlo da 4 stelle. Tra l’altro cara Expedia (e questo mi è già accaduto in altro hotel e non solo su questo Hilton)| vorrei capire come mai prenoto camere per tre persone (adulti e bambini) e mi ritrovo dei letti per due persone (in questo caso addirittura per 1 persona e 1/2 nel letto queen). Dovevo avere letto King e vi ho anche telefonato per assicurami che ci fossero i letti sufficienti perché mi era già capitato questo problema e mi riferite di stare tranquillo e poi dopo un viaggio di 15 ore dobbiamo dormire in 3 persone in un mezzo letto? Poi all’Hilton mi raccontano che forse non ci faranno pagare una camera. Ma come siamo messi?,Apr 27| 2019,2,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

El hotel está súper bien ubicado llegas a cualquier lugar caminando está a dos cuadras de central Park y como a tres cuadras de times está súper cerca de rockefeller center| la limpieza en las habitaciones no era nada esmerada podrían cuidar más eso. La gente de recepción súper apática tres palabras y listo| deberían ser más amigables. Pero bueno la ubicación del hotel compensa todo.,Jan 6| 2019,5,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
ニューヨークなのかもしれませんがアメニティが少ないです。歯ブラシ　髭剃り　スリッパ　ガウンなどありません。3人で宿泊してもコップは2個　部屋にテッシュ無し　洗面所のみ　部屋の時計のセットができない　説明書もない　　湯沸し器無し　ホテルの場所はいい　朝食はとてもいいホテル全体は広い　ホテル内のデリカはいい　ピザは美味しい　いい点と残念な点があるホテルです。,Jan 6| 2019,3,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

Hotel in posizione ideale in Midtown!!!... da ritornarci assolutamente!!!,Sep 28| 2018,4,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
Instalações impecáveis| atendimento muito bom| localização privilegiada| pode-se ir caminhando tanto para o Central Park como para a Times Square. Único ponto negativo é uma taxa compulsória mas consumível de $25/dia nos restaurantes do hotel. Os preços até são justos| mas não queríamos ter essa obrigação de fazer algumas refeições dentro do hotel para não perder o valor.,Sep 25| 2018,4,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
5min zu Fuß vom Timesquare weg... gut vom Flughafen erreichbar,Sep 25| 2018,4,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

albergo in ottima posizione ma un po' troppo dispersivo e affollato| buona la pulizia,Sep 10| 2018,3,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
立地がとても良かったです！お部屋も大変綺麗でしたが朝食の種類が少なく残念でした💦,Sep 10| 2018,3,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
口コミではトラブルがあった時の対応が悪い、など書込みがありましたが、２ベットの部屋はキレイで広かったですしアメニティの交換もハウスキーピングも行き届いていて困ることは全くありませんでした。何より、ホテル前で常時タクシーをつかまえてくれることもあり、歩くにしても、活動するには本当に立地はベストだと思います。シーズンによってはなかなか手が出ない金額になりますがやはりヒルトン。特にこのミッドタウンは安心して宿泊できるホテルだと思いました。,Sep 9| 2018,5,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019

好立地なのが何よりの魅力でした。時差のため　昼過ぎに疲れが出やすく、その時に　ホテルに帰り休憩をとることができたのがとても良かったです。,Sep 6| 2018,4,New York Hilton Midtown,1335 Avenue Of The Americas| New York| NY| 10019
