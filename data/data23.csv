Location was ideal in terms of proximity to attractions like Millennium Park and the riverwalk.,Aug 19| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
Room was incredibly clean and comfortable. Staff was friendly and attentive. Great experience!,Aug 19| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
Very clean| well maintained property. Professional| attentive staff. They only offer valet parking but are very timely when you need your vehicle.  Great location| just 1 block to the Riverwalk and walking distance to excellent restaurants and shopping. We drove to the beach| navy pier area and paid for parking (keep that in mind wherever you drive)!,Aug 19| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
The Hampton Inn is close to UIUC engineering department| slightly far to the main dinning restaurant area| about 10-15 minutes walk| but manageable. Property is clean| plenty parking space. Overall| it is a good location to stay in UIUC.,Aug 18| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601

Breakfast would have been a nice extra to include,Aug 18| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
Only thing I liked Hotel is walkable to most of the attractions and remaining things are horrible like Valet parking is so costly it’s $69 per night. Room is not good for the price. They are giving  connecting rooms and our room is so smelly due to the other connecting room persons are smoking so beware of that. No free breakfast.,Aug 18| 2021,1,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601

Highly recommended that any person visiting Chicago stay at this location. It’s close to so many attractions and conveniently located.,Aug 15| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
Great stay! Excellent location. Some of the front desk staff were not the friendliest (no acknowledgement you were coming/going) but that didn’t bother us. Rooms were a bit on the smaller side but beds were comfy and view was great. Would recommend!,Aug 14| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
El hotel tiene una excelente ubicación| en particular el aire acondicionado de mi cuarto hacia demasiado ruido que me despertaba por la noche| en general la Ciudad es cara y el valet parking del hotel cuesta 69 usd por noche| nosotros preferimos buscar un estacionamiento a 10 min de distancia.El hotel tiene muy buena tarifa comparado con los de su alrededor y cabe destacar el excelente servicio del personal| extendí mi hora del check out y en el front desk se portaron muy amables.,Aug 13| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
Most noticeable was the lack of a welcoming| comfortable lobby. That being said| the front desk staff was very helpful and friendly and our rooms were clean and up-to-date. Most positive note is the great location so close to Chicago's fun River Front!,Aug 13| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601

Holy| one of hotel receptionist. She helped my mother to find an Uber because my mother didn’t know how to do it. She went out with her and wait until she saw my mother was in the right car. Thank you!! We need more people like Holy. I would definitely recommended this hotel. Thank you Holy!,Aug 13| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
The lady at the front desk was AMAZING| I totally forgot to snag her name but she helped me and my boyfriend out from a day from hell while being on our anniversary trip. Everything that could go wrong did and when we finally got to the hotel all of our cards declined (due to traveling our banks flagged us) and she didn't let that stop us| she knew her job perfectly and finally our cards went through. It was a pivotal point in our day and she absolutely made our night 100000000x better will definitely stay here each time we're in Chicago| perfect location and can walk to any of your favorite stores. Plus it's affordable!,Aug 12| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601

The hotel is located so close to the river walk and not far from navy pier. Front desk was AMAZING! Our flight came in early and they held our bags for us and called to let us know our room was ready earlier than expected.  They took the time to ask us how things were going every time we left hotel or arrived. Room was very clean and well stocked. We were only there for a night but felt a true relationship with the employees as they were soooo friendly and constantly made sure we had what we needed and that we were enjoying our stay not only in the hotel but in Chicago. I will definitely book there next time we are in the Chicago area!,Aug 1| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
The condition of the property was somewhat tired.  Carpets in room and hallway worn.  Sparse and old furniture.  Small lobby.  Meager pantry substitute for restaurant being closed.

We stayed in room 808| immediately after we arrived I called down to ask about ANY other  room with any view besides alley-like area and men working| I was told there was nothing on all 25  floors… the room smelled musty when the air was at a comfortable 70-72| when air was running between 68-69 it was freezing but didn’t smell as bad. The bathroom had a horrible high pitched ringing sound constantly… may have been pipes. No breakfast served.. only grab and go| staff was good not overly helpful. Overall it was fine.

The location was excellent and within walking proximity to many wonderful restaurants and activities in downtown Chicago.  The hotel was very clean| quiet| and comfortable.  Only thing that was disappointing was that there was no hot breakfast available| which is what we had paid extra for.  The entire restaurant area was closed!!!

The location was excellent and within walking proximity to many wonderful restaurants and activities in downtown Chicago.  The hotel was very clean| quiet| and comfortable.  Only thing that was disappointing was that there was no hot breakfast available| which is what we had paid extra for.  The entire restaurant area was closed!!!  We did receive $20 in pantry vouchers per day| which was fine| however| we would have much preferred breakfast.,Jul 13| 2021,5,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601

Overall this is a nice hotel.  I have stayed here before.  I had a couple of issues.  First of all| you had to schedule to have your room cleaned each day.  Maybe I'm old school| but this should be a given. 2nd| I was charged $25 when I arrived 5 hours before the 4 PM check in.  However| when I checked out 5 hours before the check out time| no one offered me a $25 credit.

The hotel is in a very nice location| can walk to food| shopping| river walk.My experience was not gr8 as I arrived at 2:30 pm for 4 pm check-in time and was charged $25 extra which surprised me because most hotels will let you check in a little early without any extra charge. On the day of check out I was locked out of my room because the door lock was broke and had to be reprogrammed. No engineer on site and maintenance man needed several tries to unlock my door. I was out for about 45 mins| glad did not miss my flight. Also restaurant onsite is closed right now.

Convenience to public transportation| the riverwalk| museums| dining and millennium park are the main reasons I chose this hotel. And price.  If you are looking for the best bang for your buck the Hilton is a winner.  The only negative I will say is the comfort of the mattresses was subpar comparatively.  After long days of walking| a softer place to plop would have been welcomed.  Choose a RiverFront facing room for the best view.,May 31| 2021,4,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601

The hotel is in a very nice location| can walk to food| shopping| river walk.My experience was not gr8 as I arrived at 2:30 pm for 4 pm check-in time and was charged $25 extra which surprised me because most hotels will let you check in a little early without any extra charge. On the day of check out I was locked out of my room because the door lock was broke and had to be reprogrammed. No engineer on site and maintenance man needed several tries to unlock my door. I was out for about 45 mins| glad did not miss my flight. Also restaurant onsite is closed right now. So no food in the hotel.,Jun 2| 2021,2,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601

Hotel was fine and near Riverwalk area which was great. However it did not feel safe at night. There was a guy screaming| cursing and banging on the door to get into the hotel and we could not leave the hotel. They couldn’t find security to deal with it and finally let the guy in which was even more concerning. Did not feel safe at night - lots of people around and tons of panhandling.

The only thing I didn’t like is that you can’t pay for the room in cash until after you check out! They charge your card for everything so you might as well just pay with your card other than that very nice hotel :),Aug 12| 2020,4,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
Hotel was fine and near Riverwalk area which was great. However it did not feel safe at night. There was a guy screaming| cursing and banging on the door to get into the hotel and we could not leave the hotel. They couldn’t find security to deal with it and finally let the guy in which was even more concerning. Did not feel safe at night - lots of people around and tons of panhandling. Garage that was recommended by hotel was also scary - people definitely urinating and maybe living in the lobby of garage.

ok sorry but this hotel is a joke and rude. Our son was staying there for 4 nights and we had paid upfront in full via website and on check in they asked for a $30 per night deposit. Which we were not aware of. So he paid them in cash deposit via a card. He had asked for a late check out to which they said YES sure at no extra cost. hotel occupancy  was low so this was granted To this day he still has not received his deposit back to him after being told by hotel manager that it would be. I am guessing since he was a young man they thought they would just brush him off. Well I am disgusted at the way the hotel staff have treated him. Yes I am sure the will response with a generic response with some excuse to excuse themself for their disgusting behavior towards him and with no refund of his deposit,Jan 18| 2020,3,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601

When we tried to check in first the woman at front desk was not accommodating in letting us know about an early check in and would not give estimate nor a call-back when room would be ready.

Bartender was nasty| front desk staff was great.  Breakfast too expensive.,May 21| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
The bedsheets had stains that while they appeared to have been washed| were still disgusting. Rug hadn't been vacuumed or wasn't vacuumed very well. Rest was ok.,May 21| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601

Checkin couldnt have been faster I was prepared to leave my bags at the desk and kill 3hrs before the 4pm check in but my room was ready and they let me checkin early which was unexpected but wonderful my bed was so comfortable and the shower in my handicap room was so convenient the water temp pressure and the shower head was great I will stay here again for sure,May 12| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
Location was the best thing about the hotel. Staff was mediocre| and the parking cost was way overpriced.,May 12| 2019,3,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
Excellent hotel in a great location. Staff were attentive and very welcoming. There is a parking garage right across the street. I would use it instead of the hotel valet service. Wildberry and Broken English are two restaurants within a 5-7 minute walk. Many others to chose from,May 11| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
Was told they would charge an additional $30 that would be refunded after checkout. Somehow they charged my card an additional $155. This was money I would like to have spent around the area DURING my stay| but it is locked in my bank account till the hotel releases it upon checkout. Don’t say one thing and do another. Room was quite and clean. Maybe the extra charge was a fluke... other than that it was fine. Oh| And the side of the building that would have the most spectacular view has no windows... not sure what they were thinking.,May 11| 2019,3,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
Booked this to save some money but should have gone w different hotel for the price.  Ok| not great.,May 10| 2019,3,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601

Hotel was clean| comfortable and conveniently located.  It wasn't anything special| but definitely above average for this type of place. The bed was good| the shower was a walk-in| not a tub| which I really liked.  Free coffee in the morning.  Friendly staff.  Excellent location in the heart of Chicago and very close to the subway. You can take the subway directly from the airport to within three blocks of the hotel. Wifi was a bit slow.,Apr 7| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601

The hotel was nice and clean. Close to tourist areas and shops and around the corner from the Chicago Theatre which we attended a concert so we just walked from the hotel so that was nice. The valet service was a hassle. It made me not want to go anywhere with my car because I had 25 minutes just for them to get my car. The night I checked in I forgot something in my car| the valet guy was rude and rolled his eyes because he had to go get it.. I mean it is your job...you're not supposed to make me feel like I'm a bother...,Feb 27| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
Pros: Clean.  Friendly staff.  Location convenient to Millennium Station and Chicago Theater.  Water and/or coffee in lobby.  Cons: Couldn't close curtains all the way to make room dark.  The HVAC unit only blew out cold air no matter what the setting on the thermostat.,Feb 25| 2019,4,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
The manager on duty the day we arrived to our hotel was Holle| she was also helping me check into the rooms I booked. She was not friendly at all. Made it seem like it was an inconvenience to be helping me. However| whenever another staff memeber would walk by she would light up and make small talk with them. As soon as they would leave the vicinity she would return back to her cold behaviors. I work in customer services so I always try to be friendly and exude politeness where ever I go| so I thought it was very off putting when the manager on duty was being so cold and rude. However| later in the night I did receive help from another employee| who’s name I didn’t catch| and he did such a great job being understand and informative| trying to help me in anyway he could.,Feb 25| 2019,3,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
Great location and the staff were fantastic. I wasn't feeling well and ate at the bar late.Hakeem looked after me and gave me his personal supply of cough drops.The only negative is that there are only 8 rooms on a floor with the doors close together and are very loud when another guest enters or leaves.

El hotel es espectacular. Tuvimos la suerte de encontrar un oferton (imagino que habitualmente sera mas caro| pagamos solo 90 euros la noche) y fue el mejor hotel del viaje| sin lugar a dudas. Esta situado de forma inmejorable| limpieza| servicios| atencion| estado| tamaño de la habitacion| etc etc etc...todo inmejorable. Perfecto. Sobresaliente en todos los aspectos.,Sep 2| 2019,5,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601

Localização privilegiadíssima. É possível ir a pé a todas as principais atrações de Chicago. Só utilizamos o metrô para atrações um pouco mais afastadas. Os quartos são básicos| porém muito novos| e contam com microondas e cafeteira Keurig. Os amenities de banho são da Neutrogena. O café da manhã é pago a parte| há uma opção continental (apenas self service) e outra que custa 5 dólares a mais e permite pedir à mesa ovos| omeletes| panquecas e French toasts.,Oct 10| 2018,5,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601

ハイシーズンにお伺いしたので、値段の割に普通、、という感想です。通常料金でしたら妥当だと思います。ダウンタウンの中心にあり、どこにいくにも良い立地でした。コンビニがすぐ近くなのも助かりました。,Sep 20| 2018,3,Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown Riverwalk,66 East Wacker Place| Chicago| IL| 60601
