I regret to say that this was a very disappointing experience. The front desk reception upon arrival was very professional and pleasant. The room was just okay: the furniture seemed worn; bathroom sink made a loud drain noise; vents on the AC could not be adjusted to where they stopped blowing directly at where I was attempting to sleep; and| my room was on the sunrise facing side of the building which caused a loud crackling noise as the sun hit the building facade. Unfortunately| after arriving after midnight the first night and keeping my "occupied" sign out until about 10AM| I missed the first day's room cleaning.  I spoke with the cleaning service later that day and said that the remaining three days of my business trip I would greatly appreciate house cleaning's service:  for the next three days| I left a cash tip and a note on the bed thanking house cleaning (as I do each day every day I travel)... and no house cleaning showed up.  Lastly| the elevators were dirty with stains and streaks.  It just seemed like this hotel is starting to fall into neglect - as I have stayed at it in the past with dissimilar results.  Sorry to see this hotel fade.,16 Apr 2021,2,Hilton Fairfax,12777 Fair Lakes Cir| Fairfax| VA| 22033

The room was just okay: the furniture seemed worn; bathroom sink made a loud drain noise; vents on the AC could not be adjusted to where they stopped blowing directly at where I was attempting to sleep; and| my room was on the sunrise facing side of the building which caused a loud crackling noise as the sun hit the building facade. Unfortunately| after arriving after midnight the first night and keeping my "occupied" sign out until about 10AM| I missed the first day's room cleaning.  I spoke with the cleaning service later that day and said that the remaining three days of my business trip I would greatly appreciate house cleaning's service:  for the next three days| I left a cash tip and a note on the bed thanking house cleaning (as I do each day every day I travel)... and no house cleaning showed up.  Lastly| the elevators were dirty with stains and streaks.  It just seemed like this hotel is starting to fall into neglect - as I have stayed at it in the past with dissimilar results.  Sorry to see this hotel fade.,16 Apr 2021,2,Hilton Fairfax,12777 Fair Lakes Cir| Fairfax| VA| 22033
This was a short stay with limited time at the hotel| by design. The room was clean| modern| and had the amenities our family of five required. The value was terrific.,15 Apr 2021,4,Hilton Fairfax,12777 Fair Lakes Cir| Fairfax| VA| 22033

I usually enjoy Hyatt Hotels| however| my experience at the Fairfax Hyatt Regency was compromised as follows. 1) The room had way too much deodorant. Some hotel housekeeping departments don't properly regulate this products that can create a toxic breathing environment. 2) The bottom sheet was not 'fitted' and was too small. It came loose during the night and bunched up under me. I awoke several times| trying to straighten the bed and get comfortable| only to experience the same irritating condition again. In addition| the rest of bed linens were stiff and commercial| rather than soft and comfortable. The BED is important! Fitted sheets are an easy fix. 3) I didn't eat at the hotel| after a bad experience at the bar. Not only did the bartenders take a very long time to attend to me| while talking with each other and walking by| with no apparent purpose| but the wines were not properly handled. I was surprised to see Red Wines| half full| with corks in the top. This lack of attention to spoilage is typical for a cheap restaurant| but unexpected at a Hyatt Regency. The first glass I tried was musty and over oxidized| having been opened a day or two before.  The bartender had no clue.  The next glass was the recently opened "house" wine. It was fresh| but a poor| cheap wine. When so little attention is paid product at the bar| what should I have expected for a dinner? There are lots of places to eat in Washington.  All in all| I will likely choose a different hotel next time.,9 Nov 2019,3,Hilton Fairfax,12777 Fair Lakes Cir| Fairfax| VA| 22033

Very nice hotel! Staff was extremely helpful and courteous| check-in/out was efficient. Restaurant was small with a limited menu| but breakfast made up for that in a separate dining area. There are many options to dine near the hotel. Our rooms were clean and up to date| set up almost like a mini suite. Bed was comfortable but the couches could be better(maybe some more pillows?) My wife noted that it was very quiet in our room| we were not disturbed in any way. We had some bad weather go through and it disrupted the satellite TV reception. Guest Wi-Fi functioned adequately| got a bit slow at times. This location was important to me as it was between Washington and my wife's family to the west. Overall| a good choice.,28 May 2019,4,Hilton Fairfax,12777 Fair Lakes Cir| Fairfax| VA| 22033
It was a pleasant experience except housekeeping. They knocked on the door around 8 am. If you forgot to put "privacy tag' on the door| then they would keep knocking a half hour later. The swimming pool needed a little work but not that bad. Except these| the service| cleanness| and location are great! I would like to visit this hotel again.,28 May 2019,4,Hilton Fairfax,12777 Fair Lakes Cir| Fairfax| VA| 22033

The hotel was very nice with a great location. The check in was done pretty quick with the staff missing information to tell us. I asked about the restaurant and 2 free breakfasts included. The Front Desk clerck said that they don't do free breakfast. I had to take my reservation copy out and showed him where" 2 free breakfasts "were included in room price. Then he looked in his laptop and saw it and he said " I guess you do". Breakfats was great. The room was very nice| clean and comfortable. Love the rotating TV. The gym was big and machines were easy to understand. Went a few times with my kids to the pool| but it had a sign that maintenance was been done. Never saw anyone doing anything or there was never anyone at the pool doing any work for 3 days.During checkout I showed my breakfast receipts| as I was told by the servers at the restaurant so I would not be charged| and she said " I don't know why they told you that. You didn't have to do that:. Maybe there needs to be a bit more communication between departments. Overall it was a great and pleasant stay.

Location is great| the lobby is nice and quite big| but what I found disappointing was the cleanliness of the room. The cleaning lady came everyday between 4-5 pm| a very inconvenient time and can't say she cleaned the room adequately| did not change the sheets| and once didn't even bother to make the second bed in the room. Me and my son woke up itching every morning| I'm guessing from the dust in the room. Also| they charge a fee for the parking| sth that wasn't mentioned when I booked the hotel.,21 Apr 2019,3,Hilton Fairfax,12777 Fair Lakes Cir| Fairfax| VA| 22033
They use highly odiferous cleaning products and the windows are sealed so there is no way to air out the room. They tried but it still made me ill.,19 Apr 2019,2,Hilton Fairfax,12777 Fair Lakes Cir| Fairfax| VA| 22033

So I have stayed in this hotel before and the initial check in was nice. The hotel is set up funny so the main door and lobby are in the back of the hotel but it wasn't a big deal. They had a nice bar that serves very good food although the bartenders aren't very friendly. Now| as for my stay| if it wasn't one thing| it was another. I got a call early informing me they had a leak and had to turn the water off. I got up and took a shower only to have them come to my room to physically turn a valve off and was informed they would be back once they got it fixed to turn it back on| which was extremely annoying because I had conference calls I needed to take. In addition to that| in the middle of the night| my card I had used for the incidental fee (which was taken out as soon as I arrived per every hotel I had ever visited) was charged| or as they said| had made another hold for an odd amount- $235.76. It threw me off because it was such an odd charge and they never could tell me what this mystery hold was supposed to be for and was a large chunk of money I had not set aside for the trip so it put me in a bind during my trip. A week later and the hold still has yet to be released and they still won't let me talk to a manager to see why it was ever made in the first place or when it will be released. Overall I will NOT go back to this hotel| the workers were shady and apparently make mystery charges on your card and hope you don't notice.,16 Apr 2019,2,Hilton Fairfax,12777 Fair Lakes Cir| Fairfax| VA| 22033

One of the worst Hotels I have been in. Could not sleep 2 nights due to neighbors either talking loud| thin walls| you can hear everything and other neighbors slamming doors constantly at 3:30am. It amazes me that people have no respect for others trying to sleep at 3-4am. The front entrance is horrible| lobby area is a joke. Anyone can basically walk into the hallways| no security. I will never EVER stay here and I will never ever stay at a Hyatt Hotel ever again. They just don't seem to know how to build buildings| and treat customers. Other Hyatt properties I stayed at had thin walls. This place is a total joke. I could not wait to get out of it. Never ever again.,10 Sep 2018,1,Hilton Fairfax,12777 Fair Lakes Cir| Fairfax| VA| 22033

We took a family vacation to D.C.  This motel had a free community shuttle that took us to the metro station.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  (I had to get a form scanned and emailed back home and the motel staff was very helpful-no charge).  The rooms was spacious and clean.

Overall this hotel is great! Clean rooms and facilities throughout| separate seating area to enjoy in your room and wonderful extras. The only problems we found with our room were 1. The bathroom door lock did not work at all & 2. One of the bed lights also did not work. Service was great from housekeepers to room service| everyone was extremely friendly. The only issue we had was when my fiancé was brought the wrong omelette for breakfast but a simple phone call and it was quickly fixed. We liked the hotel so much we already booked it again to come back and stay in a few months!,10 Aug 2018,4,Hilton Fairfax,12777 Fair Lakes Cir| Fairfax| VA| 22033
